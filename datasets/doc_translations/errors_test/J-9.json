We investigate the computational process on the path toward equilibrium, where information distributed among traders is revealed step-by-step over time and incorporated into the market price. We develop a simplified model of an information market, along with trading strategies, in order to formalize the computational properties of the process. We show that securities whose payoffs cannot be expressed as weighted threshold functions of distributed input bits are not guaranteed to converge to the proper equilibrium predicted by economic theory. On the other hand, securities whose payoffs are threshold functions are guaranteed to converge, for all prior probability distributions. Moreover, these threshold securities converge in at most n rounds, where n is the number of bits of distributed information. We also prove a lower bound, showing a type of threshold security that requires at least n/2 rounds to converge in the worst case.

INTRODUCTION The strong form of the efficient markets hypothesis states that market prices nearly instantly incorporate all information available to all traders. As a result, market prices encode the best forecasts of future outcomes given all information, even if that information is distributed across many sources. Supporting evidence can be found in empirical studies of options markets [14], political stock markets [7, 8, 22], sports betting markets [3, 9, 27], horse-racing markets [30], market games [23, 24], and laboratory investigations of experimental markets [6, 25, 26]. The process of information incorporation is, at its essence, a distributed computation. Each trader begins with his or her own information. As trades are made, summary information is revealed through market prices. Traders learn or infer what information others are likely to have by observing prices, then update their own beliefs based on their observations. Over time, if the process works as advertised, all information is revealed, and all traders converge to the same information state. At this point, the market is in what is called a rational expectations equilibrium [11, 16, 19]. All information available to all traders is now reflected in the going prices, and no further trades are desirable until some new information becomes available. While most markets are not designed with information aggregation as a primary motivation-for example, derivatives 156 markets are intended mainly for risk management and sports betting markets for entertainment-recently, some markets have been created solely for the purpose of aggregating information on a topic of interest. The Iowa Electronic Market1 is a prime example, operated by the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business for the purpose of investigating how information about political elections distributed among traders gets reflected in securities prices whose payoffs are tied to actual election outcomes [7, 8]. In this paper, we investigate the nature of the computational process whereby distributed information is revealed and combined over time into the prices in information markets. To do so, in Section 3, we propose a model of an information market that is tractable for theoretical analysis and, we believe, captures much of the important essence of real information markets. In Section 4, we present our main theoretical results concerning this model. We prove that only Boolean securities whose payoffs can be expressed as threshold functions of the distributed input bits of information are guaranteed to converge as predicted by rational expectations theory. Boolean securities with more complex payoffs may not converge under some prior distributions. We also provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence time for these threshold securities. We show that, for all prior distributions, the price of a threshold security converges to its rational expectations equilibrium price in at most n rounds, where n is the number of bits of distributed information. We show that this worst-case bound is tight within a factor of two by illustrating a situation in which a threshold security requires n/2 rounds to converge. 2. RELATIONSHIP TO RELATED WORK As mentioned, there is a great deal of documented evidence supporting the notion that markets are able to aggregate information in a number of scenarios using a variety of market mechanisms. The theoretically ideal mechanism requires what is called a complete market. A complete market contains enough linearly independent securities to span the entire state space of interest [1, 31]. That is, the dimensionality of the available securities equals the dimensionality of the event space over which information is to be aggregated.2 In this ideal case, all private information becomes common knowledge in equilibrium, and thus any function of the private information can be directly evaluated by any agent or observer. However, this theoretical ideal is almost never achievable in practice, because it generally requires a number of securities exponential in the number of random variables of interest. When available securities form an incomplete market [17] in relation to the desired information space-as is usually the case-aggregation may be partial. Not all private information is revealed in equilibrium, and prices may not convey enough information to recover the complete joint probability distribution over all events. Still, it is generally assumed that aggregation does occur along the dimensions represented in the market; that is, prices do reflect a consistent projection of the entire joint distribution onto the smaller-dimensional space spanned by securities. In this pa1 http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/ 2 When we refer to independence or dimensionality of securities, we mean the independence or dimensionality of the random variables on which the security payoffs are based. per, we investigate cases in which even this partial aggregation fails. For example, even though there is enough private information to determine completely the price of a security in the market, the equilibrium price may in fact reveal no information at all! So characterizations of when a rational expectations equilibrium is fully revealing do not immediately apply to our problem. We are not asking whether all possible functions of private information can be evaluated, but whether a particular target function can be evaluated. We show that properties of the function itself play a major role, not just the relative dimensionalities of the information and security spaces. Our second main contribution is examining the dynamics of information aggregation before equilibrium, in particular proving upper and lower bounds on the time to convergence in those cases in which aggregation succeeds. Shoham and Tennenholtz [29] define a rationally computable function as a function of agents valuations (types) that can be computed by a market, assuming agents follow rational equilibrium strategies. The authors mainly consider auctions of goods as their basic mechanistic unit and examine the communication complexity involved in computing various functions of agents valuations of goods. For example, they give auction mechanisms that can compute the maximum, minimum, and kth-highest of the agents valuations of a single good using 1, 1, and n − k + 1 bits of communication, respectively. They also examine the potential tradeoff between communication complexity and revenue. 3. MODEL OF AN INFORMATION MARKET To investigate the properties and limitations of the process whereby an information market converges toward its rational-expectations equilibrium, we formulate a representative model of the market. In designing the model, our goals were two-fold: (1) to make the model rich enough to be realistic and (2) to make the model simple enough to admit meaningful analysis. Any modeling decisions must trade off these two generally conflicting goals, and the decision process is as much an art as a science. Nonetheless, we believe that our model captures enough of the essence of real information markets to lend credence to the results that follow. In this section, we present our modeling assumptions and justifications in detail. Section 3.1 describes the initial information state of the system, Section 3.2 covers the market mechanism, and Section 3.3 presents the agents strategies. 3.1 Initial information state There are n agents (traders) in the system, each of whom is privy to one bit of information, denoted xi. The vector of all n bits is denoted x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn). In the initial state, each agent is aware only of her own bit of information. All agents have a common prior regarding the joint distribution of bits among agents, but none has any specific information about the actual value of bits held by others. Note that this common-prior assumption-typical in the economics literature-does not imply that all agents agree. To the contrary, because each agent has different information, the initial state of the system is in general a state of disagreement. Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The security being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits. The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents. We sometimes refer to the xi as the input bits. At some time in the future after trading is completed, the true value of f(x) is revealed,4 and every owner of the security is paid an amount f(x) in cash per unit owned. If an agent ends with a negative quantity of the security (by selling short), then the agent must pay the amount f(x) in cash per unit. Note that if someone were to have complete knowledge of all input bits x, then that person would know the true value f(x) of the security with certainty, and so would be willing to buy it at any price lower than f(x) and (short) sell it at any price higher than f(x).5 Following Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik [4], and Jackson and Peck [13], we model the market-price formation process as a multiperiod Shapley-Shubik market game [28]. The Shapley-Shubik process operates as follows: The market proceeds in synchronous rounds. In each round, each agent i submits a bid bi and a quantity qi. The semantics are that agent i is supplying a quantity qi of the security and an amount bi of money to be traded in the market. For simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit or short sales, and so an agents trade is not constrained by her possessions. The market clears in each round by settling at a single price that balances the trade in that round: The clearing price is p = i bi/ i qi. At the end of the round, agent i holds a quantity qi proportional to the money she bid: qi = bi/p. In addition, she is left with an amount of money bi that reflects her net trade at price p: bi = bi − p(qi − qi) = pqi. Note that agent is net trade in the security is a purchase if p < bi/qi and a sale if p > bi/qi. After each round, the clearing price p is publicly revealed. Agents then revise their beliefs according to any information garnered from the new price. The next round proceeds as the previous. The process continues until an equilibrium is reached, meaning that prices and bids do not change from one round to the next. In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for each agent i. This modeling assumption serves two analytical purposes. First, it ensures that there is forced trade in every round. Classic results in economics show that perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have differing information) [20]. There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy. We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the 3 Common knowledge is information that all agents know, that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad infinitum [5]. 4 The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be publicly revealed. 5 Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money. informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons). Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple function of the agents bids, p = i bi/n. We will discuss the implications of alternative market models in Section 5. 3.3 Agent strategies In order to draw formal conclusions about the price evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how agents behave. Essentially we assume that agents are riskneutral, myopic,6 and bid truthfully: Each agent in each round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which is that agents estimation of the expected payoff of the security. Expectations are computed according to each agents probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes rule when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) becomes available. We also assume that it is common knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner. Would rational agents actually behave according to this strategy? Its hard to say. Certainly, we do not claim that this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense. Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to effect other agents judgments in the following rounds (nonmyopic reasoning). However, we believe that the strategy outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis. Solving for a true game-theoretic equilibrium strategy in this setting seems extremely difficult. Our assumptions seem reasonable when there are enough agents in the system such that extremely complex meta-reasoning is not likely to improve upon simply bidding ones true expected value. In this case, according the the Shapley-Shubik mechanism, if the clearing price is below an agents expected value that agent will end up buying (increasing expected profit); otherwise, if the clearing price is above the agents expected value, the agent will end up selling (also increasing expected profit). 4. COMPUTATIONAL PROPERTIES In this section, we study the computational power of information markets for a very simple class of aggregation functions: Boolean functions of n variables. We characterize the set of Boolean functions that can be computed in our market model for all prior distributions and then prove upper and lower bounds on the worst-case convergence time for these markets. The information structure we assume is as follows: There are n agents, and each agent i has a single bit of private information xi. We use x to denote the vector (x1, . . . , xn) of inputs. All the agents also have a common prior probability distribution P : {0, 1}n → [0, 1] over the values of x. We define a Boolean aggregate function f(x) : {0, 1}n → {0, 1} that we would like the market to compute. Note that x, and hence f(x), is completely determined by the combination of all the agents information, but it is not known to any one agent. The agents trade in a Boolean security F, which pays off $1 if f(x) = 1 and $0 if f(x) = 0. So an omniscient 6 Risk neutrality implies that each agents utility for the security is linearly related to his or her subjective estimation of the expected payoff of the security. Myopic behavior means that agents treat each round as if it were the final round: They do not reason about how their bids may affect the bids of other agents in future rounds. 158 agent with access to all the agents bits would know the true value of security F-either exactly $1 or exactly $0. In reality, risk-neutral agents with limited information will value F according to their expectation of its payoff, or Ei[f(x)], where Ei is the expectation operator applied according to agent is probability distribution. For any function f, trading in F may happen to converge to the true value of f(x) by coincidence if the prior probability distribution is sufficiently degenerate. More interestingly, we would like to know for which functions f does the price of the security F always converge to f(x) for all prior probability distributions P.7 In Section 4.2, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees convergence. In Section 4.3, we address the natural follow-up question, by deriving upper and lower bounds on the worst-case number of rounds of trading required for the value of f(x) to be revealed. 4.1 Equilibrium price characterization Our analysis builds on a characterization of the equilibrium price of F that follows from a powerful result on common knowledge of aggregates due to McKelvey and Page [19], later extended by Nielsen et al. [21]. Information markets aim to aggregate the knowledge of all the agents. Procedurally, this occurs because the agents learn from the markets: The price of the security conveys information to each agent about the knowledge of other agents. We can model the flow of information through prices as follows. Let Ω = {0, 1}n be the set of possible values of x; we say that Ω denotes the set of possible states of the world. The prior P defines everyones initial belief about the likelihood of each state. As trading proceeds, some possible states can be logically ruled out, but the relative likelihoods among the remaining states are fully determined by the prior P. So the common knowledge after any stage is completely described by the set of states that an external observer-with no information beyond the sequence of prices observed-considers possible (along with the prior). Similarly, the knowledge of agent i at any point is also completely described by the set of states she considers possible. We use the notation Sr to denote the common-knowledge possibility set after round r, and Sr i to denote the set of states that agent i considers possible after round r. Initially, the only common knowledge is that the input vector x is in Ω; in other words, the set of states considered possible by an external observer before trading has occurred is the set S0 = Ω. However, each agent i also knows the value of her bit xi; thus, her knowledge set S0 i is the set {y ∈ Ω|yi = xi}. Agent is first-round bid is her conditional expectation of the event f(x) = 1 given that x ∈ S0 i . All the agents bids are processed, and the clearing price p1 is announced. An external observer could predict agent is bid if he knew the value of xi. Thus, if he knew the value of x, he could predict the value of p1 . In other words, the external observer knows the function price1 (x) that relates the first round price to the true state x. Of course, he does not know the value of x; however, he can rule out any vector x that would have resulted in a different clearing price from the observed price p1 . 7 We assume that the common prior is consistent with x in the sense that it assigns a non-zero probability to the actual value of x. Thus, the common knowledge after round 1 is the set S1 = {y ∈ S0 | price1 (y) = p1 }. Agent i knows the common knowledge and, in addition, knows the value of bit xi. Hence, after every round r, the knowledge of agent i is given by Sr i = {y ∈ Sr |yi = xi}. Note that, because knowledge can only improve over time, we must always have Sr i ⊆ Sr−1 i and Sr ⊆ Sr−1 . Thus, only a finite number of changes in each agents knowledge are possible, and so eventually we must converge to an equilibrium after which no player learns any further information. We use S∞ to denote the common knowledge at this point, and S∞ i to denote agent is knowledge at this point. Let p∞ denote the clearing price at equilibrium. Informally, McKelvey and Page [19] show that, if n people with common priors but different information about the likelihood of some event A agree about a suitable aggregate of their individual conditional probabilities, then their individual conditional probabilities of event As occurring must be identical. (The precise definition of suitable is described below.) There is a strong connection to rational expectation equilibria in markets, which was noted in the original McKelvey-Page paper: The market price of a security is common knowledge at the point of equilibrium. Thus, if the price is a suitable aggregate of the conditional expectations of all the agents, then in equilibrium they must have identical conditional expectations of the event that the security will pay off. (Note that their information may still be different.) Definition 1. A function g : n → is called stochastically monotone if it can be written in the form g(x) = i gi(xi), where each function gi : → is strictly increasing. Bergin and Brandenburger [2] proved that this simple definition of stochastically monotone functions is equivalent to the original definition in McKelvey-Page [19]. Definition 2. A function g : n → is called stochastically regular if it can be written in the form g = h ◦ g , where g is stochastically monotone and h is invertible on the range of g . We can now state the McKelvey-Page result, as generalized by Nielsen et al. [21]. In our context, the following simple theorem statement suffices; more general versions of this theorem can be found in [19, 21]. Theorem 1. (Nielsen et al. [21]) Suppose that, at equilibrium, the n agents have a common prior, but possibly different information, about the value of a random variable F, as described above. For all i, let p∞ i = E(F|x ∈ S∞ i ). If g is a stochastically regular function and g(p∞ 1 , p∞ 2 , . . . , p∞ n ) is common knowledge, then it must be the case that p∞ 1 = p∞ 2 = · · · = p∞ n = E(F|x ∈ S∞ ) = p∞ In one round of our simplified Shapley-Shubik trading model, the announced price is the mean of the conditional expectations of the n agents. The mean is a stochastically regular function; hence, Theorem 1 shows that, at equilibrium, all agents have identical conditional expectations of the payoff of the security. It follows that the equilibrium 159 price p∞ must be exactly the conditional expectations of all agents at equilibrium. Theorem 1 does not in itself say how the equilibrium is reached. McKelvey and Page, extending an argument due to Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis [10], show that repeated announcement of the aggregate will eventually result in common knowledge of the aggregate. In our context, this is achieved by announcing the current price at the end of each round; this will ultimately converge to a state in which all agents bid the same price p∞ . However, reaching an equilibrium price is not sufficient for the purposes of information aggregation. We also want the price to reveal the actual value of f(x). It is possible that the equilibrium price p∞ of the security F will not be either 0 or 1, and so we cannot infer the value of f(x) from it. Example 1: Consider two agents 1 and 2 with private input bits x1 and x2 respectively. Suppose the prior probability distribution is uniform, i.e., x = (x1, x2) takes the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1) each with probability 1 4 . Now, suppose the aggregate function we want to compute is the XOR function, f(x) = x1 ⊕ x2. To this end, we design a market to trade in a Boolean security F, which will eventually payoff $1 iff x1 ⊕ x2 = 1. If agent 1 observes x1 = 1, she estimates the expected value of F to be the probability that x2 = 0 (given x1 = 1), which is 1 2 . If she observes x1 = 0, her expectation of the value of F is the conditional probability that x2 = 1, which is also 1 2 . Thus, in either case, agent 1 will bid 0.5 for F in the first round. Similarly, agent 2 will also always bid 0.5 in the first round. Hence, the first round of trading ends with a clearing price of 0.5. From this, agent 2 can infer that agent 1 bid 0.5, but this gives her no information about the value of x1-it is still equally likely to be 0 or 1. Agent 1 also gains no information from the first round of trading, and hence neither agent changes her bid in the following rounds. Thus, the market reaches equilibrium at this point. As predicted by Theorem 1, both agents have the same conditional expectation (0.5) at equilibrium. However, the equilibrium price of the security F does not reveal the value of f(x1, x2), even though the combination of agents information is enough to determine it precisely. 4.2 Characterizing computable aggregates We now give a necessary and sufficient characterization of the class of functions f such that, for any prior distribution on x, the equilibrium price of F will reveal the true value of f. We show that this is exactly the class of weighted threshold functions: Definition 3. A function f : {0, 1}n → {0, 1} is a weighted threshold function iff there are real constants w1, w2, . . . , wn such that f(x) = 1 iff n i=1 wixi ≥ 1 Theorem 2. If f is a weighted threshold function, then, for any prior probability distribution P, the equilibrium price of F is equal to f(x). Proof: Let S∞ i denote the possibility set of agent i at equilibrium. As before, we use p∞ to denote the final trading price at this point. Note that, by Theorem 1, p∞ is exactly agent is conditional expectation of the value of f(x), given her final possibility set S∞ i . First, observe that if p∞ is 0 or 1, then we must have f(x) = p∞ , regardless of the form of f. For instance, if p∞ = 1, this means that E(f(y)|y ∈ S∞ ) = 1. As f(·) can only take the values 0 or 1, it follows that P(f(y) = 1|y ∈ S∞ ) = 1. The actual value x is always in the final possibility set S∞ , and, furthermore, it must have non-zero prior probability, because it actually occurred. Hence, it follows that f(x) = 1 in this case. An identical argument shows that if p∞ = 0, f(x) = 0. Hence, it is enough to show that, if f is a weighted threshold function, then p∞ is either 0 or 1. We prove this by contradiction. Let f(·) be a weighted threshold function corresponding to weights {wi}, and assume that 0 < p∞ < 1. By Theorem 1, we must have: P(f(y) = 1|y ∈ S∞ ) = p∞ (1) ∀i P(f(y) = 1|y ∈ S∞ i ) = p∞ (2) Recall that S∞ i = {y ∈ S∞ |yi = xi}. Thus, Equation (2) can be written as ∀i P(f(y) = 1|y ∈ S∞ , yi = xi) = p∞ (3) Now define J+ i = P(yi = 1|y ∈ S∞ , f(y) = 1) J− i = P(yi = 1|y ∈ S∞ , f(y) = 0) J+ = n i=1 wiJ+ i J− = n i=1 wiJ− i Because by assumption p∞ = 0, 1, both J+ i and J− i are well-defined (for all i): Neither is conditioned on a zeroprobability event. Claim: Eqs. 1 and 3 imply that J+ i = J− i , for all i. Proof of claim: We consider the two cases xi = 1 and xi = 0 separately. Case (i): xi = 1. We can assume that J− i and J+ i are not both 0 (or else, the claim is trivially true). In this case, we have P(f(y) = 1|y ∈ S∞ ) · J+ i P(f(y) = 1|y ∈ S∞) · J+ i + P(f(y) = 0|y ∈ S∞) · J− i = P(f(y) = 1|yi = 1, y ∈ S∞ ) (Bayes law) p∞ J+ i p∞J+ i + (1 − p∞)J− i = p∞ (by Eqs. 1 and 3) J+ i = p∞ J+ i + (1 − p∞ )J− i =⇒ J+ i = J− i (as p∞ = 1) Case (ii): xi = 0. When xi = 0, observe that the argument of Case (i) can be used to prove that (1 − J+ i ) = (1 − J− i ). It immediately follows that J+ i = J− i as well. 2 Hence, we must also have J+ = J− . But using linearity of expectation, we can also write J+ as J+ = E n i=1 wiyi y ∈ S∞ , f(y) = 1 , 160 and, because f(y) = 1 only when i wiyi ≥ 1, this gives us J+ ≥ 1. Similarly, J− = E n i=1 wiyi y ∈ S∞ , f(y) = 0 , and thus J− < 1. This implies J− = J+ , which leads to a contradiction. 2 Perhaps surprisingly, the converse of Theorem 2 also holds: Theorem 3. Suppose f : {0, 1}n → {0, 1} cannot be expressed as a weighted threshold function. Then there exists a prior distribution P for which the price of the security F does not converge to the value of f(x). Proof: We start from a geometric characterization of weighted threshold functions. Consider the Boolean hypercube {0, 1}n as a set of points in n . It is well known that f is expressible as a weighted threshold function iff there is a hyperplane in n that separates all the points at which f has value 0 from all the points at which f has value 1. Now, consider the sets H+ = Conv(f−1 (1)) and H− = Conv(f−1 (0)), where Conv(S) denotes the convex hull of S in n . H+ and H− are convex sets in n , and so, if they do not intersect, we can find a separating hyperlane between them. This means that, if f is not expressible as a weighted threshold function, H+ and H− must intersect. In this case, we show how to construct a prior P for which f(x) is not computed by the market. Let x∗ ∈ n be a point in H+ ∩ H− . Because x∗ is in H+ , there exists some points z1 , z2 , . . . , zm and constants λ1, λ2, . . . , λm, such that the following constraints are satisfied: ∀k zk ∈ {0, 1}n , and f(zk ) = 1 ∀k 0 < λk ≤ 1 m k=1 λk = 1 m k=1 λkzk = x∗ Similarly, because x∗ ∈ H− , there are points y1 , y2 , . . . , yl and constants µ1, µ2, . . . , µl, such that ∀j yj ∈ {0, 1}n , and f(yj ) = 0 ∀j 0 < µj ≤ 1 l j=1 µj = 1 l j=1 µj yj = x∗ We now define our prior distribution P as follows: P(zk ) = λk 2 for k = 1, 2, . . . , m P(yj ) = µj 2 for j = 1, 2, . . . , l, and all other points are assigned probability 0. It is easy to see that this is a valid probability distribution. Under this distribution P, first observe that P(f(x) = 1) = 1 2 . Further, for any i such that 0 < x∗ i < 1, we have P(f(x) = 1|xi = 1) = P(f(x) = 1 ∧ xi = 1) P(xi = 1) = x∗ i 2 x∗ i = 1 2 and P(f(x) = 1|xi = 0) = P(f(x) = 1 ∧ xi = 0) P(xi = 0) = (1−x∗ i ) 2 (1 − x∗ i ) = 1 2 For indices i such that x∗ i is 0 or 1 exactly, is private information reveals no additional information under prior P, and so here too we have P(f(x) = 1|xi = 0) = P(f(x) = 1|xi = 1) = 1 2 . Hence, regardless of her private bit xi, each agent i will bid 0.5 for security F in the first round. The clearing price of 0.5 also reveals no additional information, and so this is an equilibrium with price p∞ = 0.5 that does not reveal the value of f(x). 2 The XOR function is one example of a function that cannot be expressed as weighted threshold function; Example 1 illustrates Theorem 3 for this function. 4.3 Convergence time bounds We have shown that the class of Boolean functions computable in our model is the class of weighted threshold functions. The next natural question to ask is: How many rounds of trading are necessary before the equilibrium is reached? We analyze this problem using the same simplified Shapley-Shubik model of market clearing in each round. We first prove that, in the worst case, at most n rounds are required. The idea of the proof is to consider the sequence of common knowledge sets Ω = S0 , S1 , . . ., and show that, until the market reaches equilibrium, each set has a strictly lower dimension than the previous set. Definition 4. For a set S ⊆ {0, 1}n , the dimension of set S is the dimension of the smallest linear subspace of n that contains all the points in S; we use the notation dim(S) to denote it. Lemma 1. If Sr = Sr−1 , then dim(Sr ) < dim(Sr−1 ). Proof: Let k = dim(Sr−1 ). Consider the bids in round r. In our model, agent i will bid her current expectation for the value of F, br i = E(f(y) = 1|y ∈ Sr−1 , yi = xi). Thus, depending on the value of xi, br i will take on one of two values h (0) i or h (1) i . Note that h (0) i and h (1) i depend only on the set Sr−1 , which is common knowledge before round 161 r. Setting di = h (1) i − h (0) i , we can write br i = h (0) i + dixi. It follows that the clearing price in round r is given by pr = 1 n n i=1 (h (0) i + dixi) (4) All the agents already know all the h (0) i and di values, and they observe the price pr at the end of the rth round. Thus, they effectively have a linear equation in x1, x2, . . . , xn that they use to improve their knowledge by ruling out any possibility that would not have resulted in price pr . In other words, after r rounds, the common knowledge set Sr is the intersection of Sr−1 with the hyperplane defined by Equation (4). It follows that Sr is contained in the intersection of this hyperplane with the k-dimension linear space containing Sr−1 . If Sr is not equal to Sr−1 , this intersection defines a linear subspace of dimension (k − 1) that contains Sr , and hence Sr has dimension at most (k − 1). 2 Theorem 4. Let f be a weighted threshold function, and let P be an arbitrary prior probability distribution. Then, after at most n rounds of trading, the price reaches its equilibrium value p∞ = f(x). Proof: Consider the sequence of common knowledge sets S0 , S1 , . . ., and let r be the minimum index such that Sr = Sr−1 . Then, the rth round of trading does not improve any agents knowledge, and thus we must have S∞ = Sr−1 and p∞ = pr−1 . Observing that dim(S0 ) = n, and applying Lemma 1 to the first r − 1 rounds, we must have (r − 1) ≤ n. Thus, the price reaches its equilibrium value within n rounds. 2 Theorem 4 provides an upper bound of O(n) on the number of rounds required for convergence. We now show that this bound is tight to within a factor of 2 by constructing a threshold function with 2n inputs and a prior distribution for which it takes n rounds to determine the value of f(x) in the worst case. The functions we use are the carry-bit functions. The function Cn takes 2n inputs; for convenience, we write the inputs as x1, x2 . . . , xn, y1, y2, . . . , yn or as a pair (x, y). The function value is the value of the high-order carry bit when the binary numbers xnxn−1 · · · x1 and ynyn−1 · · · y1 are added together. In weighted threshold form, this can be written as Cn(x, y) = 1 iff n i=1 xi + yi 2n+1−i ≥ 1. For this proof, let us call the agents A1, A2, . . . , An, B1, B2, . . . , Bn, where Ai holds input bit xi, and Bi holds input bit yi. We first illustrate our technique by proving that computing C2 requires 2 rounds in the worst case. To do this, we construct a common prior P2 as follows: • The pair (x1, y1) takes on the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) uniformly (i.e., with probability 1 4 each). • We extend this to a distribution on (x1, x2, y1, y2) by specifying the conditional distribution of (x2, y2) given (x1, y1): If (x1, y1) = (1, 1), then (x2, y2) takes the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) with probabilities 1 2 , 1 6 , 1 6 , 1 6 respectively. Otherwise, (x2, y2) takes the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) with probabilities 1 6 , 1 6 , 1 6 , 1 2 respectively. Now, suppose x1 turns out to be 1, and consider agent A1s bid in the first round. It is given by b1 A1 = P(C2(x1, x2, y1, y2) = 1|x1 = 1)) = P(y1 = 1|x1 = 1) · P((x2, y2) = (0, 0)|x1 = 1, y1 = 1) +P(y1 = 0|x1 = 1) · P((x2, y2) = (1, 1)|x1 = 1, y1 = 0) = 1 2 · 1 2 + 1 2 · 1 2 = 1 2 On the other hand, if x1 turns out to be 0, agent A1s bid would be given by b1 A1 = P(C2(x1, x2, y1, y2) = 1|x1 = 0)) = P((x2, y2) = (1, 1)|x1 = 0) = 1 2 Thus, irrespective of her bit, A1 will bid 0.5 in the first round. Note that the function and distribution are symmetric between x and y, and so the same argument shows that B1 will also bid 0.5 in the first round. Thus, the price p1 announced at the end of the first round reveals no information about x1 or y1. The reason this occurs is that, under this distribution, the second carry bit C2 is statistically independent of the first carry bit (x1 ∧ y1); we will use this trick again in the general construction. Now, suppose that (x2, y2) is either (0, 1) or (1, 0). Then, even if x2 and y2 are completely revealed by the first-round price, the value of C2(x1, x2, y1, y2) is not revealed: It will be 1 if x1 = y1 = 1 and 0 otherwise. Thus, we have shown that at least 2 rounds of trading will be required to reveal the function value in this case. We now extend this construction to show by induction that the function Cn takes n rounds to reach an equilibrium in the worst case. Theorem 5. There is a function Cn with 2n inputs and a prior distribution Pn such that, in the worst case, the market takes n rounds to reveal the value of Cn(·). Proof: We prove the theorem by induction on n. The base case for n = 2 has already been shown to be true. Starting from the distribution P2 described above, we construct the distributions P3, P4, . . . , Pn by inductively applying the following rule: • Let x−n denote the vector (x1, x2, . . . , xn−1), and define y−n similarly. We extend the distribution Pn−1 on (x−n , y−n ) to a distribution Pn on (x, y) by specifying the conditional distribution of (xn, yn) given (x−n , y−n ): If Cn−1(x−n , y−n ) = 1, then (xn, yn) takes the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) with probabilities 1 2 , 1 6 , 1 6 , 1 6 respectively. Otherwise, (xn, yn) takes the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) with probabilities 1 6 , 1 6 , 1 6 , 1 2 respectively. Claim: Under distribution Pn, for all i < n, P(Cn(x, y) = 1|xi = 1) = P(Cn(x, y) = 1|xi = 0). 162 Proof of claim: A similar calculation to that used for C2 above shows that the value of Cn(x, y) under this distribution is statistically independent of Cn−1(x−n , y−n ). For i < n, xi can affect the value of Cn only through Cn−1. Also, by contruction of Pn, given the value of Cn−1, the distribution of Cn is independent of xi. It follows that Cn(x, y) is statistically independent of xi as well. Of course, a similar result holds for yi by symmetry. Thus, in the first round, for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, the bids of agents Ai and Bi do not reveal anything about their private information. Thus, the first-round price does not reveal any information about the value of (x−n , y−n ). On the other hand, agents An and Bn do have different expectations of Cn(x) depending on whether their input bit is a 0 or a 1; thus, the first-round price does reveal whether neither, one, or both of xn and yn are 1. Now, consider a situation in which (xn, yn) takes on the value (1, 0) or (0, 1). We show that, in this case, after one round we are left with the residual problem of computing the value of Cn−1(x−n , y−n ) under the prior Pn−1. Clearly, when xn + yn = 1, Cn(x, y) = Cn−1(x−n , y−n ). Further, according to the construction of Pn, the event (xn+ yn = 1) has the same probability (1/3) for all values of (x−n , y−n ). Thus, conditioning on this fact does not alter the probability distribution over (x−n , y−n ); it must still be Pn−1. Finally, the inductive assumption tells us that solving this residual problem will take at least n − 1 more rounds in the worst case and hence that finding the value of Cn(x, y) takes at least n rounds in the worst case. 2 5. DISCUSSION Our results have been derived in a simplified model of an information market. In this section, we discuss the applicability of these results to more general trading models. Assuming that agents bid truthfully, Theorem 2 holds in any model in which the price is a known stochastically monotone aggregate of agents bids. While it seems reasonable that the market price satisfies monotonicity properties, the exact form of the aggregate function may not be known if the volume of each users trades is not observable; this depends on the details of the market process. Theorem 3 and Theorem 5 hold more generally; they only require that an agents strategy depends only on her conditional expectation of the securitys value. Perhaps the most fragile result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar dimension-based bound will hold for other families of nonlinear clearing prices. Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information. However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information. Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model. Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible. One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12]. These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security. Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known. If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds. Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions. This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18]. In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs. The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5 also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs, where each agents private information is a real number. Further, Theorem 2 also holds provided the market reaches equilibrium. With real inputs and arbitrary prior distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 6. CONCLUSION 6.1 Summary We have framed the process of information aggregation in markets as a computation on distributed information. We have developed a simplified model of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market. Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly. Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security payoff function is a weighted threshold function. We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case. We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets. Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true. Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders. It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation. In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed? For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully. A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions. It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together. What is the minimum number of threshold securities required to implement a given function? This is exactly the problem of minimizing the size of a neural network, a well-studied problem known to be NP-hard [15]. What configuration of securities can best approximate a given function? Are there ways to define and configure securities to speed up convergence to equilibrium? What is the relationship between machine learning (e.g., neural-network learning) and information-market design? Acknowledgments We thank Joe Kilian for many helpful discussions.

Introducción La forma sólida de la hipótesis de los mercados eficientes establece que los precios del mercado incorporan casi instantáneamente toda la información disponible para todos los comerciantes. Como resultado, los precios del mercado codifican los mejores pronósticos de los resultados futuros dados toda la información, incluso si esa información se distribuye en muchas fuentes. Se puede encontrar evidencia de apoyo en los estudios empíricos de los mercados de opciones [14], los mercados de valores políticos [7, 8, 22], los mercados de apuestas deportivas [3, 9, 27], los mercados de carreras de caballos [30], los juegos de mercado [23,24], e investigaciones de laboratorio de mercados experimentales [6, 25, 26]. El proceso de incorporación de información es, en su esencia, un cálculo distribuido. Cada comerciante comienza con su propia información. A medida que se realizan las operaciones, la información resumida se revela a través de los precios del mercado. Los comerciantes aprenden o inferen qué información es probable que otros tengan al observar los precios y luego actualizar sus propias creencias en función de sus observaciones. Con el tiempo, si el proceso funciona como se anuncia, se revela toda la información y todos los comerciantes convergen con el mismo estado de información. En este punto, el mercado está en lo que se llama un equilibrio de expectativas racionales [11, 16, 19]. Toda la información disponible para todos los comerciantes ahora se refleja en los precios actuales, y no se desean más operaciones hasta que haya información nueva disponible. Si bien la mayoría de los mercados no están diseñados con la agregación de información como un ejemplo de motivación principal, para el ejemplo, los mercados de Derivados 156 están destinados principalmente a la gestión de riesgos y a los mercados de apuestas deportivas para el entretenimiento.de interés. El Iowa Electronic Market1 es un excelente ejemplo, operado por el Colegio de Negocios de la Universidad de Iowa Tippie con el fin de investigar cómo la información sobre las elecciones políticas distribuidas entre los comerciantes se refleja en los precios de los valores cuyos pagos están vinculados a los resultados electorales reales [7, 8]. En este documento, investigamos la naturaleza del proceso computacional mediante el cual la información distribuida se revela y combina con el tiempo en los precios en los mercados de la información. Para hacerlo, en la Sección 3, proponemos un modelo de un mercado de la información que sea manejable para el análisis teórico y, creemos, captura gran parte de la esencia importante de los mercados de información reales. En la Sección 4, presentamos nuestros principales resultados teóricos sobre este modelo. Probamos que solo los valores booleanos cuyos pagos pueden expresarse como funciones umbral de los bits de información de entrada distribuidos están garantizadas que convergen según lo predicho por la teoría de las expectativas racionales. Los valores booleanos con pagos más complejos pueden no converger bajo algunas distribuciones anteriores. También proporcionamos límites superiores e inferiores en el tiempo de convergencia para estos valores umbral. Mostramos que, para todas las distribuciones anteriores, el precio de una seguridad umbral converge a sus expectativas racionales Precio de equilibrio en la mayoría de las rondas n, donde n es el número de bits de información distribuida. Mostramos que este peor límite es apretado dentro de un factor de dos al ilustrar una situación en la que una seguridad umbral requiere que convergen N/2 rondas.2. Relación con el trabajo relacionado Como se mencionó, existe una gran cantidad de evidencia documentada que respalda la noción de que los mercados pueden agregar información en varios escenarios utilizando una variedad de mecanismos de mercado. El mecanismo teóricamente ideal requiere lo que se llama un mercado completo. Un mercado completo contiene suficientes valores linealmente independientes para abarcar todo el espacio de interés estatal [1, 31]. Es decir, la dimensionalidad de los valores disponibles es igual a la dimensionalidad del espacio de eventos sobre el cual se agregará la información.2 En este caso ideal, toda la información privada se convierte en conocimiento común en equilibrio y, por lo tanto, cualquier función de la información privada puede ser directamenteevaluado por cualquier agente u observador. Sin embargo, este ideal teórico casi nunca es alcanzable en la práctica, ya que generalmente requiere una serie de valores exponenciales en el número de variables aleatorias de interés. Cuando los valores disponibles forman un mercado incompleto [17] en relación con la información deseada, el espacio-AS es generalmente la agregación de casos puede ser parcial. No toda la información privada se revela en equilibrio, y los precios pueden no transmitir suficiente información para recuperar la distribución de probabilidad conjunta completa en todos los eventos. Aún así, generalmente se supone que la agregación ocurre a lo largo de las dimensiones representadas en el mercado;Es decir, los precios reflejan una proyección consistente de toda la distribución conjunta en el espacio de menor dimensión abarcado por los valores. En este PA1 http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/ 2 Cuando nos referimos a la independencia o dimensionalidad de los valores, nos referimos a la independencia o dimensionalidad de las variables aleatorias en las que se basan los pagos de seguridad.Por, investigamos casos en los que incluso esta agregación parcial falla. Por ejemplo, a pesar de que hay suficiente información privada para determinar completamente el precio de una seguridad en el mercado, ¡el precio de equilibrio de hecho puede revelar ninguna información! Por lo tanto, las caracterizaciones de cuándo un equilibrio de expectativas racionales es completamente reveladora no se aplican inmediatamente a nuestro problema. No preguntamos si todas las funciones posibles de información privada pueden evaluarse, sino si se puede evaluar una función objetivo particular. Mostramos que las propiedades de la función en sí juegan un papel importante, no solo las dimensiones relativas de la información y los espacios de seguridad. Nuestra segunda contribución principal es examinar la dinámica de la agregación de información antes del equilibrio, en particular demostrando los límites superiores e inferiores en el tiempo de convergencia en aquellos casos en los que la agregación tiene éxito. Shoham y Tennenholtz [29] definen una función racionalmente computable en función de las valoraciones (tipos) de los agentes que pueden calcular por un mercado, suponiendo que los agentes sigan estrategias de equilibrio racional. Los autores consideran principalmente las subastas de bienes como su unidad mecanicista básica y examinan la complejidad de la comunicación involucrada en la calculación de diversas funciones de las valoraciones de los agentes de los bienes. Por ejemplo, dan mecanismos de subasta que pueden calcular los máximos, mínimos y más altos de las valoraciones de los agentes de un solo bien usando bits de comunicación 1, 1 y N-K + 1, respectivamente. También examinan la compensación potencial entre la complejidad de la comunicación y los ingresos.3. Modelo de un mercado de la información para investigar las propiedades y limitaciones del proceso mediante el cual un mercado de la información converge hacia su equilibrio de expectativas racionales, formulamos un modelo representativo del mercado. Al diseñar el modelo, nuestros objetivos fueron dobles: (1) hacer que el modelo sea lo suficientemente rico como para ser realista y (2) para hacer que el modelo sea lo suficientemente simple como para admitir un análisis significativo. Cualquier decisión de modelado debe intercambiar estos dos objetivos generalmente conflictivos, y el proceso de decisión es tanto un arte como una ciencia. No obstante, creemos que nuestro modelo captura suficiente de la esencia de los mercados de información reales para dar crédito a los resultados que siguen. En esta sección, presentamos nuestros supuestos de modelado y justificaciones en detalle. La Sección 3.1 describe el estado de información inicial del sistema, la Sección 3.2 cubre el mecanismo de mercado y la Sección 3.3 presenta las estrategias de los agentes.3.1 Información inicial Estado Hay N agentes (comerciantes) en el sistema, cada uno de los cuales está al tanto de un poco de información, denotado XI. El vector de todos los n bits se denota x = (x1, x2, ..., xn). En el estado inicial, cada agente es consciente solo de su propia información. Todos los agentes tienen un principio común con respecto a la distribución conjunta de bits entre los agentes, pero ninguno tiene información específica sobre el valor real de los bits en poder de otros. Tenga en cuenta que esta suposición común-prior-típica en la literatura económica no implica que todos los agentes estén de acuerdo. Por el contrario, debido a que cada agente tiene información diferente, el estado inicial del sistema es en general un estado de desacuerdo. Casi cualquier desacuerdo que pueda modelarse asumiendo diferentes antecedentes puede ser MOD157 elegido asumiendo un anterior común con información diferente, por lo que la suposición común-prior no es tan severa como puede parecer.3.2 Mecanismo de mercado La seguridad que negocia los agentes es un instrumento financiero cuyo pago es una función F (x) de los bits de los agentes. La forma de F (la descripción de la seguridad) es el conocimiento común3 entre los agentes. A veces nos referimos al XI como los bits de entrada. En algún momento en el futuro después de que se complete la negociación, se revela el verdadero valor de F (x), 4 y a todos los propietarios de la seguridad se le paga una cantidad F (x) en efectivo por unidad propiedad. Si un agente termina con una cantidad negativa de la seguridad (vendiéndose corto), entonces el agente debe pagar la cantidad F (x) en efectivo por unidad. Tenga en cuenta que si alguien tuviera un conocimiento completo de todos los bits de entrada x, entonces esa persona sabría el valor verdadero F (x) de la seguridad con certeza, por lo que estaría dispuesto a comprarlo a cualquier precio inferior a F (x)y (breve) véndelo a cualquier precio más alto que F (x) .5 Después de Dubey, Ganakoplos y Shubik [4], y Jackson y Peck [13], modelamos el proceso de formación de precios de mercado como un Shapley-Shubik de MultisteriodJuego de mercado [28]. El proceso Shapley-Shubik funciona de la siguiente manera: el mercado procede en rondas sincrónicas. En cada ronda, cada agente I presenta una oferta bi y una cantidad Qi. La semántica es que el Agente I está proporcionando una cantidad de Qi de la seguridad y una cantidad de dinero bi que se comercializará en el mercado. Para simplificar, suponemos que no hay restricciones en el crédito o las ventas cortas, por lo que un comercio de agentes no está limitado por sus posesiones. El mercado se borra en cada ronda al resolver un precio único que equilibra el comercio en esa ronda: el precio de compensación es p = i bi/ i qi. Al final de la ronda, el agente I tiene una cantidad Qi proporcional al dinero que ofertó: qi = bi/p. Además, se queda con una cantidad de dinero BI que refleja su comercio neto al precio P: BI = BI - P (Qi - Qi) = PQI. Tenga en cuenta que el agente es el comercio neto de la seguridad es una compra si p <bi/qi y una venta si p> bi/qi. Después de cada ronda, el precio de compensación P se revela públicamente. Los agentes luego revisan sus creencias de acuerdo con cualquier información obtenida del nuevo precio. La siguiente ronda procede como la anterior. El proceso continúa hasta que se alcanza un equilibrio, lo que significa que los precios y las ofertas no cambian de una ronda a otra. En este artículo, hacemos una restricción más simplificadora en el comercio en cada ronda: asumimos que Qi = 1 para cada agente i. Esta suposición de modelado tiene dos propósitos analíticos. Primero, asegura que haya comercio forzado en cada ronda. Los resultados clásicos en economía muestran que los agentes perfectamente racionales y neutrales de riesgo nunca comerciarán entre sí por razones puramente especulativas (incluso si tienen información diferente) [20]. Hay muchos factores que pueden inducir a los agentes racionales al comercio, como diferentes grados de aversión al riesgo, la presencia de otros comerciantes que están operando por razones de liquidez en lugar de una ganancia especulativa, o un fabricante de mercado que está bombeando dinero al mercado a través de un subsidio. Evitamos este problema simplemente asumiendo que el conocimiento común es información que todos los agentes saben, que todos los agentes saben que todos los agentes saben, y así sucesivamente en el infinito [5].4 Los valores de los bits de entrada mismos pueden o no revelarse públicamente.5 A lo largo de este artículo ignoramos el valor temporal del dinero.Los agentes informados comerciarán (por razones no especificadas). En segundo lugar, forzar Qi = 1 para todo lo que I significa que el volumen total de comercio y el impacto de cualquier comerciante en el precio de compensación son de conocimiento común;El precio de compensación P es una función simple de las ofertas de los agentes, p = i bi/n. Discutiremos las implicaciones de los modelos de mercado alternativos en la Sección 5. 3.3 Estrategias de agente Para sacar conclusiones formales sobre el proceso de evolución de los precios, necesitamos hacer algunas suposiciones sobre cómo se comportan los agentes. Esencialmente, suponemos que los agentes son RiskNeutral, Miopic, 6 y ofertan sinceramente: cada agente en cada ronda ofrece su valoración actual de la seguridad, que es que los agentes estiman la recompensa esperada de la seguridad. Las expectativas se calculan de acuerdo con la distribución de probabilidad de cada agente, que se actualiza a través de la regla de Bayes cuando está disponible una nueva información (revelada a través de los precios de compensación). También suponemos que es de conocimiento común que todos los agentes se comportan de la manera especificada. ¿Se comportarían los agentes racionales de acuerdo con esta estrategia? Es difícil de decir. Ciertamente, no afirmamos que esta sea una estrategia de equilibrio en el sentido teórico del juego. Además, está claro que estamos ignorando algunas tácticas legítimas, por ejemplo, ofertas falsamente en una ronda para efectuar juicios de otros agentes en las siguientes rondas (razonamiento no miopic). Sin embargo, creemos que la estrategia descrita es un punto de partida razonable para el análisis. Resolver una verdadera estrategia de equilibrio teórico del juego en este entorno parece extremadamente difícil. Nuestros supuestos parecen razonables cuando hay suficientes agentes en el sistema, de modo que no es probable que mejore el meta-razonamiento extremadamente complejo mejore simplemente un valor esperado de simple oferta. En este caso, según el mecanismo de Shapley-Shubik, si el precio de compensación está por debajo del valor esperado de los agentes que el agente terminará comprando (aumentando las ganancias esperadas);De lo contrario, si el precio de compensación está por encima del valor esperado de los agentes, el agente terminará vendiendo (también aumentando las ganancias esperadas).4. Propiedades computacionales En esta sección, estudiamos el poder computacional de los mercados de información para una clase muy simple de funciones de agregación: funciones booleanas de n variables. Caracterizamos el conjunto de funciones booleanas que se pueden calcular en nuestro modelo de mercado para todas las distribuciones anteriores y luego demostramos límites superiores e inferiores en el peor tiempo de convergencia para estos mercados. La estructura de información que suponemos es la siguiente: hay N agentes, y cada agente I tiene un solo poco de información privada XI. Usamos X para denotar el vector (x1, ..., xn) de entradas. Todos los agentes también tienen una distribución de probabilidad previa común p: {0, 1} n → [0, 1] sobre los valores de x. Definimos una función agregada booleana f (x): {0, 1} n → {0, 1} que nos gustaría que el mercado calcule. Tenga en cuenta que X, y por lo tanto F (x), está completamente determinado por la combinación de toda la información de los agentes, pero no es conocido por ningún agente. Los agentes comercian con una seguridad booleana F, que paga $ 1 si f (x) = 1 y $ 0 si f (x) = 0. Por lo tanto, una neutralidad de riesgo omnisciente 6 implica que cada utilidad de los agentes para la seguridad está linealmente relacionada con su estimación subjetiva de la recompensa esperada de la seguridad. El comportamiento miope significa que los agentes tratan cada ronda como si fuera la ronda final: no razonan cómo sus ofertas pueden afectar las ofertas de otros agentes en futuras rondas.158 agente con acceso a todos los bits de los agentes sabrá el verdadero valor de la seguridad f-o, ya sea exactamente $ 1 o exactamente $ 0. En realidad, los agentes neutrales de riesgo con información limitada valorarán F de acuerdo con su expectativa de su recompensa, o EI [F (x)], donde EI es el operador de expectativa aplicado de acuerdo con el agente es la distribución de probabilidad. Para cualquier función F, el comercio F puede converger con el verdadero valor de F (x) por coincidencia si la distribución de probabilidad previa es suficientemente degenerada. Más interesante, nos gustaría saber qué funciones F hace el precio de la seguridad F siempre converge a F (x) para todas las distribuciones de probabilidad previas p.7 En la Sección 4.2, demostramos una condición necesaria y suficiente que garantiza la convergencia. En la Sección 4.3, abordamos la pregunta de seguimiento natural, derivando los límites superior e inferior en el peor número de rondas de comercio requeridos para que se revele el valor de F (x).4.1 Caracterización del precio de equilibrio Nuestro análisis se basa en una caracterización del precio de equilibrio de F que se deduce de un poderoso resultado en el conocimiento común de los agregados debido a McKelvey y Page [19], más tarde extendido por Nielsen et al.[21]. Los mercados de la información tienen como objetivo agregar el conocimiento de todos los agentes. Procedentalmente, esto ocurre porque los agentes aprenden de los mercados: el precio de la seguridad transmite información a cada agente sobre el conocimiento de otros agentes. Podemos modelar el flujo de información a través de los precios de la siguiente manera. Sea ω = {0, 1} n el conjunto de valores posibles de x;Decimos que ω denota el conjunto de posibles estados del mundo. La P anterior define a todos la creencia inicial sobre la probabilidad de cada estado. A medida que avanza el comercio, algunos posibles estados pueden descartarse lógicamente, pero las probabilidades relativas entre los estados restantes están completamente determinados por la P. P. por lo que el conocimiento común después de cualquier etapa se describe completamente por el conjunto de estados de que un observador externo conNo hay información más allá de la secuencia de precios observados posibles (junto con el anterior). Del mismo modo, el conocimiento del Agente I en cualquier momento también se describe completamente por el conjunto de estados que considera posible. Utilizamos la notación SR para denotar la posibilidad de conocimiento común establecida después de la ronda R, y SR i para denotar el conjunto de estados que el agente que considera posible después de la ronda R.Inicialmente, el único conocimiento común es que el vector de entrada X está en Ω;En otras palabras, el conjunto de estados considerados posibles por un observador externo antes de que se haya producido el comercio es el conjunto S0 = Ω. Sin embargo, cada agente también conoce el valor de su bit xi;Por lo tanto, su conjunto de conocimiento S0 I es el conjunto {y ∈ ω | yi = xi}. El agente es la oferta de primera ronda es su expectativa condicional del evento f (x) = 1 dado que x ∈ S0 i. Todas las ofertas de los agentes se procesan y se anuncia el precio de compensación P1. Un observador externo podría predecir que el agente se apuesta si supiera el valor de XI. Por lo tanto, si supiera el valor de X, podría predecir el valor de P1. En otras palabras, el observador externo conoce el precio de la función1 (x) que relaciona el precio de la primera ronda con el verdadero estado x. Por supuesto, él no conoce el valor de X;Sin embargo, puede descartar cualquier vector X que hubiera resultado en un precio de compensación diferente del precio observado P1.7 Suponemos que el anterior común es consistente con X en el sentido de que asigna una probabilidad distinta de cero al valor real de x. Por lo tanto, el conocimiento común después de la Ronda 1 es el conjunto S1 = {y ∈ S0 |Price1 (y) = P1}. Agente I conoce el conocimiento común y, además, conoce el valor del bit xi. Por lo tanto, después de cada ronda R, el conocimiento del agente I es dado por Sr i = {y ∈ Sr | yi = xi}. Tenga en cuenta que, debido a que el conocimiento solo puede mejorar con el tiempo, siempre debemos tener SR I ⊆ SR - 1 I y SR ⊆ SR - 1. Por lo tanto, solo es posible un número finito de cambios en el conocimiento de cada agente, por lo que eventualmente debemos converger a un equilibrio después de lo cual ningún jugador aprende más información. Usamos S∞ para denotar el conocimiento común en este punto, y S∞ i para denotar el agente es el conocimiento en este momento. Deje que P∞ denote el precio de compensación en equilibrio. Informalmente, McKelvey y Page [19] muestran que, si n personas con antecedentes comunes pero información diferente sobre la probabilidad de algún evento de acuerdo sobre un agregado adecuado de sus probabilidades condicionales individuales, entonces sus probabilidades condicionales individuales de evento que ocurren deben ser idénticas.(La definición precisa de adecuada se describe a continuación). Existe una fuerte conexión con los equilibrios de expectativas racionales en los mercados, que se observó en el artículo original de McKelvey-Page: el precio de mercado de una seguridad es de conocimiento común en el punto de equilibrio. Por lo tanto, si el precio es un agregado adecuado de las expectativas condicionales de todos los agentes, entonces en equilibrio deben tener expectativas condicionales idénticas del evento que la seguridad valga la pena.(Tenga en cuenta que su información aún puede ser diferente). Definición 1. Una función g: n → se llama estocásticamente monótona si se puede escribir en la forma g (x) = i gi (xi), donde cada función gi: → está aumentando estrictamente. Bergin y Brandenburger [2] demostraron que esta definición simple de funciones estocásticamente monótonas es equivalente a la definición original en McKelvey-Page [19]. Definición 2. Una función g: n → se llama estocásticamente regular si se puede escribir en la forma g = h ◦ g, donde g es estocásticamente monótono y H es invertible en el rango de g. Ahora podemos indicar el resultado de McKelvey-Page, según lo generalizado por Nielsen et al.[21]. En nuestro contexto, la siguiente declaración del teorema simple es suficiente;Las versiones más generales de este teorema se pueden encontrar en [19, 21]. Teorema 1. (Nielsen et al. [21]) Suponga que, en equilibrio, los agentes de N tienen una información común, pero posiblemente diferente, sobre el valor de una variable aleatoria F, como se describe anteriormente. Para todos los i, deje p∞ i = e (f | x ∈ S∞ i). Si G es una función estocásticamente regular y G (P∞ 1, P∞ 2, ..., P∞ n) es de conocimiento común, entonces debe ser el caso de que P∞ 1 = P∞ 2 = · · · = P∞ n = e (f | x ∈ S∞) = P∞ En una ronda de nuestro modelo de comercio Simplificado Shapley-Shubik, el precio anunciado es la media de las expectativas condicionales de los N agentes. La media es una función estocásticamente regular;Por lo tanto, el Teorema 1 muestra que, en equilibrio, todos los agentes tienen expectativas condicionales idénticas de la recompensa de la seguridad. De ello se deduce que el precio de equilibrio 159 P∞ debe ser exactamente las expectativas condicionales de todos los agentes en equilibrio. El Teorema 1 no dice en sí mismo cómo se alcanza el equilibrio. McKelvey y Page, que extiende un argumento debido a Geanakoplos y Polemarchakis [10], muestran que el anuncio repetido del agregado eventualmente dará como resultado un conocimiento común del agregado. En nuestro contexto, esto se logra anunciando el precio actual al final de cada ronda;Esto finalmente convergerá a un estado en el que todos los agentes ofertan el mismo precio P∞. Sin embargo, alcanzar un precio de equilibrio no es suficiente para los fines de la agregación de información. También queremos que el precio revele el valor real de F (x). Es posible que el precio de equilibrio P∞ de la seguridad F no sea 0 o 1, por lo que no podemos inferir el valor de f (x) de él. Ejemplo 1: Considere dos agentes 1 y 2 con bits de entrada privados X1 y X2 respectivamente. Suponga que la distribución de probabilidad previa es uniforme, es decir, x = (x1, x2) toma los valores (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) y (1, 1) cada uno con probabilidad 1 4. Ahora, suponga que la función agregada que queremos calcular es la función XOR, f (x) = x1 ⊕ x2. Con este fin, diseñamos un mercado para comerciar con una seguridad booleana F, que eventualmente pagará $ 1 IFF x1 ⊕ x2 = 1. Si el agente 1 observa x1 = 1, estima que el valor esperado de F es la probabilidad de que x2 = 0 (dado x1 = 1), que es 1 2. Si observa x1 = 0, su expectativa del valor de F es la probabilidad condicional de que x2 = 1, que también sea 1 2. Por lo tanto, en cualquier caso, el Agente 1 ofertará 0.5 por F en la primera ronda. Del mismo modo, el Agente 2 también siempre ofertará 0.5 en la primera ronda. Por lo tanto, la primera ronda de negociación termina con un precio de compensación de 0.5. A partir de esto, el Agente 2 puede inferir que el Agente 1 BID 0.5, pero esto no le da información sobre el valor de X1-It, es igual de probabilidades de ser 0 o 1. El Agente 1 tampoco gana información de la primera ronda de comercio y, por lo tanto, ninguno de los agentes cambia su oferta en las siguientes rondas. Por lo tanto, el mercado alcanza el equilibrio en este punto. Según lo predicho por el Teorema 1, ambos agentes tienen la misma expectativa condicional (0.5) en el equilibrio. Sin embargo, el precio de equilibrio de la seguridad F no revela el valor de F (x1, x2), a pesar de que la combinación de información de los agentes es suficiente para determinarlo con precisión.4.2 Caracterización de agregados computables Ahora damos una caracterización necesaria y suficiente de la clase de funciones F de tal manera que, para cualquier distribución previa en x, el precio de equilibrio de F revelará el verdadero valor de f.Mostramos que esta es exactamente la clase de funciones de umbral ponderadas: definición 3. Una función f: {0, 1} n → {0, 1} es una función umbral ponderada si hay constantes reales w1, w2 ,..., wn tal que f (x) = 1 iff n i = 1 wixi ≥ 1 teorema 2. Si F es una función umbral ponderada, entonces, para cualquier distribución de probabilidad previa P, el precio de equilibrio de F es igual a F (x). Prueba: Sea s∞. Denote el conjunto de posibilidades del agente I en el equilibrio. Como antes, usamos P∞ para denotar el precio comercial final en este momento. Tenga en cuenta que, por el Teorema 1, P∞ es exactamente el agente es la expectativa condicional del valor de F (x), dada su posibilidad final establecida S∞ i. Primero, observe que si P∞ es 0 o 1, entonces debemos tener f (x) = p∞, independientemente de la forma de f.Por ejemplo, si P∞ = 1, esto significa que E (f (y) | y ∈ S∞) = 1. Como f (·) solo puede tomar los valores 0 o 1, se deduce que p (f (y) = 1 | y ∈ S∞) = 1. El valor real X siempre está en el conjunto de posibilidades final S∞ y, además, debe tener una probabilidad previa no cero, porque en realidad ocurrió. Por lo tanto, se deduce que f (x) = 1 en este caso. Un argumento idéntico muestra que si p∞ = 0, f (x) = 0. Por lo tanto, es suficiente mostrar que, si F es una función umbral ponderada, entonces P∞ es 0 o 1. Probamos esto por contradicción. Sea f (·) una función umbral ponderada correspondiente a los pesos {wi}, y suponga que 0 <p∞ <1. Por el teorema 1, debemos tener: p (f (y) = 1 | y ∈ S∞) = P∞ (1) ∀i p (f (y) = 1 | y ∈ S∞ i) = P∞ (2) Recuerde que s∞ i = {y ∈ S∞ | yi = xi}. Por lo tanto, la ecuación (2) puede escribirse como ∀i p (f (y) = 1 | y ∈ S∞, yi = xi) = p∞ (3) ahora define j+ i = p (yi = 1 | y ∈ S∞, f (y) = 1) j− i = p (yi = 1 | y ∈ S∞, f (y) = 0) j+ = n i = 1 wij+ i j− = n i = 1 wij− i porque por supuestoP∞ = 0, 1, tanto J+ I como J- I están bien definidos (para todos I): ninguno está condicionado en un evento de Zeroprobability. Reclamación: Eqs.1 y 3 implican que j+ i = j− i, para todos i. Prueba de reclamo: Consideramos los dos casos xi = 1 y xi = 0 por separado. Caso (i): xi = 1. Podemos suponer que J− I y J+ I no son 0 (o de lo contrario, la afirmación es trivialmente verdadera). En este caso, tenemos p (f (y) = 1 | y ∈ S∞) · j+ i p (f (y) = 1 | y ∈ S∞) · j+ i+ p (f (y) = 0 |y ∈ S∞) · j− i = p (f (y) = 1 | yi = 1, y ∈ S∞) (Ley de Bayes) P∞ J+ I P∞J+ I+ (1 - P∞) J− I =P∞ (por las ecuaciones 1 y 3) j+ i = p∞ j+ i+ (1 - p∞) j− i = ⇒ j+ i = j− i (como p∞ = 1) caso (ii): xi = 0. Cuando xi = 0, observe que el argumento del caso (i) puede usarse para demostrar que (1 - j+ i) = (1 - j− i). Inmediatamente se deduce que J+ i = J- I también.2 Por lo tanto, también debemos tener j+ = j−. Pero usando la linealidad de la expectativa, también podemos escribir j+ como j+ = e n i = 1 wiyi y ∈ S∞, f (y) = 1, 160 y, porque f (y) = 1 solo cuando i wiyi ≥ 1, esto daEE. UU. J+ ≥ 1. Del mismo modo, j− = e n i = 1 wiyi y ∈ S∞, f (y) = 0 y, por lo tanto, j− <1. Esto implica j− = j+, lo que conduce a una contradicción.2 Quizás sorprendentemente, lo contrario del Teorema 2 también se mantiene: Teorema 3. Suponga que f: {0, 1} n → {0, 1} no se puede expresar como una función umbral ponderada. Luego existe una distribución previa P para la cual el precio de la seguridad F no converge al valor de F (x). Prueba: Comenzamos desde una caracterización geométrica de funciones umbral ponderadas. Considere el hipercube booleano {0, 1} n como un conjunto de puntos en n. Es bien sabido que F es expresable como una función umbral ponderada si hay un hiperplano en n que separa todos los puntos en los que F tiene valor 0 de todos los puntos en los que F tiene valor 1. Ahora, considere los conjuntos H+ = conv (F - 1 (1)) y H− = conv (F - 1 (0)), donde Conv (s) denota el casco convexo de S en n. H+ y H- son conjuntos convexos en n, y así, si no se cruzan, podemos encontrar un hiperlano separador entre ellos. Esto significa que, si F no es expresable como una función umbral ponderada, H+ y H- deben intersectarse. En este caso, mostramos cómo construir una P anterior para la cual F (x) no es calculada por el mercado. Sea x ∗ ∈ N un punto en H+ ∩ H−. Debido a que x ∗ está en H+, existe algunos puntos Z1, Z2 ,..., zm y constantes λ1, λ2 ,..., λm, de modo que se cumplan las siguientes restricciones: ∀k zk ∈ {0, 1} n, y f (zk) = 1 ∀k 0 <λk ≤ 1 m k = 1 λk = 1 m k = 1 λkzk = x ∗, porque x ∗ ∈ H-, hay puntos y1, y2 ,..., yl y constantes µ1, µ2 ,..., µl, de modo que ∀j yj ∈ {0, 1} n, y f (yj) = 0 ∀j 0 <µj ≤ 1 l j = 1 µj = 1 l j = 1 µj yj = x ∗ ahora definimos nuestra distribución previaP como sigue: p (zk) = λk 2 para k = 1, 2 ,..., m p (yj) = µJ 2 para j = 1, 2 ,..., L, y a todos los demás puntos se les asigna probabilidad 0. Es fácil ver que esta es una distribución de probabilidad válida. Bajo esta distribución P, primero observe que P (F (x) = 1) = 1 2. Además, para cualquiera que 0 <x ∗ i <1, tenemos p (f (x) = 1 | xi = 1) = p (f (x) = 1 ∧ xi = 1) P (xi = 1)= x ∗ i 2 x ∗ i = 1 2 y p (f (x) = 1 | xi = 0) = p (f (x) = 1 ∧ xi = 0) p (xi = 0) = (1 - x∗ i) 2 (1 - x ∗ i) = 1 2 Para los índices I tal que x ∗ i es 0 o 1 exactamente, es información privada no revela información adicional en PER PRERIVO P, por lo que aquí también tenemos P (F (X) = 1 | xi = 0) = p (f (x) = 1 | xi = 1) = 1 2. Por lo tanto, independientemente de su bit privado Xi, cada agente ofertaré 0.5 por la seguridad F en la primera ronda. El precio de compensación de 0.5 también no revela información adicional, por lo que este es un equilibrio con el precio P∞ = 0.5 que no revela el valor de F (x).2 La función XOR es un ejemplo de una función que no se puede expresar como función umbral ponderada;El ejemplo 1 ilustra el teorema 3 para esta función.4.3 Límites de tiempo de convergencia Hemos demostrado que la clase de funciones booleanas computables en nuestro modelo es la clase de funciones de umbral ponderadas. La siguiente pregunta natural que debe hacer es: ¿cuántas rondas de comercio son necesarias antes de que se alcance el equilibrio? Analizamos este problema utilizando el mismo modelo de compensación de mercado Simplified Shapley-Shubik en cada ronda. Primero demostramos que, en el peor de los casos, se requieren en la mayoría de las redes n. La idea de la prueba es considerar la secuencia de conjuntos de conocimiento común ω = S0, S1 ,..., Y demuestre que, hasta que el mercado alcance el equilibrio, cada conjunto tiene una dimensión estrictamente más baja que el conjunto anterior. Definición 4. Para un conjunto S ⊆ {0, 1} n, la dimensión del conjunto S es la dimensión del subespacio lineal más pequeño de N que contiene todos los puntos en S;Usamos los dim (s) de notación para denotarlo. Lema 1. Si Sr = Sr - 1, entonces dim (Sr) <dim (Sr - 1). Prueba: Sea K = Dim (SR - 1). Considere las ofertas en la ronda r.En nuestro modelo, agente, presentaré su expectativa actual por el valor de f, br i = e (f (y) = 1 | y ∈ Sr - 1, yi = xi). Por lo tanto, dependiendo del valor de Xi, broméis de uno de los dos valores H (0) I o H (1) i. Tenga en cuenta que H (0) I y H (1) I dependen solo del conjunto SR - 1, que es de conocimiento común antes de la ronda 161 r.Configurar di = h (1) i - h (0) i, podemos escribir br i = h (0) i + dixi. Se deduce que el precio de compensación en la ronda R viene dado por Pr = 1 n n i = 1 (h (0) i + dixi) (4) Todos los agentes ya saben todos los valores H (0) I y DI, y observan elPrecio PR al final de la ronda RTH. Por lo tanto, tienen efectivamente una ecuación lineal en x1, x2 ,..., xn que usan para mejorar su conocimiento descartando cualquier posibilidad que no hubiera resultado en el precio PR. En otras palabras, después de las rondas R, el conjunto de conocimiento común SR es la intersección de SR - 1 con el hiperplano definido por la ecuación (4). Se deduce que SR está contenido en la intersección de este hiperplano con el espacio lineal K-Dimension que contiene SR-1. Si SR no es igual a SR - 1, esta intersección define un subespacio lineal de dimensión (k - 1) que contiene SR y, por lo tanto, SR tiene dimensión como máximo (k - 1).2 Teorema 4. Sea F una función umbral ponderada, y sea P una distribución de probabilidad previa arbitraria. Luego, después de la mayoría de las n rondas de negociación, el precio alcanza su valor de equilibrio P∞ = F (x). Prueba: considere la secuencia de conjuntos de conocimiento común S0, S1 ,..., Y Sea r el índice mínimo tal que Sr = Sr - 1. Luego, la ronda de comercio RTH no mejora el conocimiento de los agentes, y por lo tanto debemos tener S∞ = Sr - 1 y P∞ = PR - 1. Observando que dim (s0) = n, y aplicando lema 1 a las primeras rondas r - 1, debemos tener (r - 1) ≤ n.Por lo tanto, el precio alcanza su valor de equilibrio dentro de n rondas.2 Teorema 4 proporciona un límite superior de O (n) en el número de rondas requeridas para la convergencia. Ahora mostramos que este límite está apretado dentro de un factor de 2 al construir una función umbral con entradas 2N y una distribución previa para la cual se necesitan n rondas para determinar el valor de F (x) en el peor de los casos. Las funciones que utilizamos son las funciones de bit. La función CN toma entradas 2n;Por conveniencia, escribimos las entradas como x1, x2..., xn, y1, y2 ,..., yn o como un par (x, y). El valor de la función es el valor del bit de transporte de alto orden cuando se agregan los números binarios xnxn-1 · · · x1 e ynyn-1 · · · y1. En la forma de umbral ponderado, esto se puede escribir como CN (x, y) = 1 iff n i = 1 xi + yi 2n + 1 - i ≥ 1. Para esta prueba, llamemos a los agentes A1, A2 ,..., An, B1, B2 ,..., Bn, donde AI contiene el bit de entrada Xi, y BI contiene el bit de entrada Yi. Primero ilustramos nuestra técnica demostrando que la computación C2 requiere 2 rondas en el peor de los casos. Para hacer esto, construimos un P2 anterior común de la siguiente manera: • El par (x1, y1) toma los valores (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) de manera uniforme (es decir, con probabilidad 1 4 cada uno).• Extendemos esto a una distribución de (x1, x2, y1, y2) especificando la distribución condicional de (x2, y2) dada (x1, y1): if (x1, y1) = (1, 1), entonces ((x2, y2) toma los valores (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) con probabilidades 1 2, 1 6, 1 6, 1 6 respectivamente. De lo contrario, (x2, y2) toma los valores (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) con probabilidades 1 6, 1 6, 1 6, 1 2 respectivamente. Ahora, suponga que X1 resulta ser 1, y considere la oferta del agente A1 en la primera ronda. Viene dado por b1 a1 = p (c2 (x1, x2, y1, y2) = 1 | x1 = 1)) = p (y1 = 1 | x1 = 1) · p ((x2, y2) = (0,0) | x1 = 1, y1 = 1) +p (y1 = 0 | x1 = 1) · p ((x2, y2) = (1, 1) | x1 = 1, y1 = 0) = 1 2 · 12 + 1 2 · 1 2 = 1 2 Por otro lado, si X1 resulta ser 0, la oferta del agente A1 sería dada por B1 A1 = P (C2 (x1, x2, y1, y2) = 1 | x1 =0)) = P ((x2, y2) = (1, 1) | x1 = 0) = 1 2 Por lo tanto, independientemente de su bit, A1 ofertará 0.5 en la primera ronda. Tenga en cuenta que la función y la distribución son simétricas entre X e Y, por lo que el mismo argumento muestra que B1 también ofertará 0.5 en la primera ronda. Por lo tanto, el precio P1 anunciado al final de la primera ronda no revela información sobre X1 o Y1. La razón por la que esto ocurre es que, bajo esta distribución, el segundo bit de transporte C2 es estadísticamente independiente del primer bit de transporte (x1 ∧ y1);Usaremos este truco nuevamente en la construcción general. Ahora, supongamos que (x2, y2) es (0, 1) o (1, 0). Luego, incluso si X2 e Y2 son completamente revelados por el precio de primera ronda, el valor de C2 (x1, x2, y1, y2) no se revela: será 1 si x1 = y1 = 1 y 0 de lo contrario. Por lo tanto, hemos demostrado que se requerirán al menos 2 rondas de comercio para revelar el valor de la función en este caso. Ahora ampliamos esta construcción para mostrar por inducción que la función CN toma N rondas para alcanzar un equilibrio en el peor de los casos. Teorema 5. Hay una función CN con entradas 2N y una distribución previa PN de tal manera que, en el peor de los casos, el mercado toma N rondas para revelar el valor de CN (·). Prueba: Probamos el teorema por inducción en n.El caso base para n = 2 ya se ha demostrado que es verdadero. A partir de la distribución P2 descrita anteriormente, construimos las distribuciones P3, P4 ,..., PN aplicando inductivamente la siguiente regla: • Sea X - N denotar el vector (x1, x2, ..., xn - 1), y defina Y -N de manera similar. Extendemos la distribución PN - 1 en (x - n, y - n) a una distribución pn en (x, y) especificando la distribución condicional de (xn, yn) dada (x - n, y - n): siCn - 1 (x - n, y - n) = 1, entonces (xn, yn) toma los valores (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) con probabilidades 12, 1 6, 1 6, 1 6 respectivamente. De lo contrario, (xn, yn) toma los valores (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) con probabilidades 1 6, 1 6, 1 6, 1 2 respectivamente. Reclamación: bajo distribución PN, para todos i <n, p (cn (x, y) = 1 | xi = 1) = p (cn (x, y) = 1 | xi = 0).162 Prueba de reclamo: un cálculo similar al utilizado para C2 anterior muestra que el valor de CN (x, y) bajo esta distribución es estadísticamente independiente de CN - 1 (X - N, Y - N). Para i <n, Xi puede afectar el valor de CN solo a través de CN - 1. Además, mediante la contracción de PN, dado el valor de CN - 1, la distribución de CN es independiente de Xi. Se deduce que CN (X, Y) también es estadísticamente independiente de Xi. Por supuesto, un resultado similar es válido para Yi por simetría. Así, en la primera ronda, para todos i = 1, 2 ,..., N - 1, las ofertas de los agentes AI y BI no revelan nada sobre su información privada. Por lo tanto, el precio de primera ronda no revela ninguna información sobre el valor de (x-n, y-n). Por otro lado, los agentes y BN tienen diferentes expectativas de CN (x) dependiendo de si su bit de entrada es un 0 o un 1;Por lo tanto, el precio de primera ronda revela si ninguno, uno o ambos de Xn e Yn son 1. Ahora, considere una situación en la que (xn, yn) adquiere el valor (1, 0) o (0, 1). Mostramos que, en este caso, después de una ronda, nos queda el problema residual de calcular el valor de CN - 1 (X - N, Y - N) bajo el PN - 1 anterior. Claramente, cuando xn + yn = 1, cn (x, y) = cn - 1 (x - n, y - n). Además, según la construcción de PN, el evento (xn+ yn = 1) tiene la misma probabilidad (1/3) para todos los valores de (x - n, y - n). Por lo tanto, el acondicionamiento en este hecho no altera la distribución de probabilidad sobre (x - n, y - n);aún debe ser PN - 1. Finalmente, la suposición inductiva nos dice que resolver este problema residual tomará al menos n - 1 más rondas en el peor de los casos y, por lo tanto, que encontrar el valor de CN (x, y) toma al menos n rondas en el peor de los casos.2 5. Discusión Nuestros resultados se han derivado en un modelo simplificado de un mercado de la información. En esta sección, discutimos la aplicabilidad de estos resultados a modelos comerciales más generales. Suponiendo que los agentes ofertan con sinceridad, el Teorema 2 se mantiene en cualquier modelo en el que el precio es un agregado estocásticamente monótono de las ofertas de los agentes. Si bien parece razonable que el precio de mercado satisfaga las propiedades de la monotonicidad, la forma exacta de la función agregada puede no ser conocida si el volumen de las operaciones de cada usuarios no es observable;Esto depende de los detalles del proceso de mercado. El teorema 3 y el teorema 5 se mantienen más en general;Solo requieren que una estrategia de agentes depende solo de su expectativa condicional del valor de seguridad. Quizás el resultado más frágil es el Teorema 4, que se basa en la forma lineal del precio de compensación de Shapley-Shubik (además de las condiciones para el Teorema 2);Sin embargo, parece plausible que un límite similar a la dimensión se mantenga para otras familias de precios de compensación no lineales. Hasta este punto, hemos descrito el modelo con el mismo número de agentes que bits de información. Sin embargo, todos los resultados se mantienen incluso si hay competencia en forma de un número conocido de agentes que conocen cada información. De hecho, modelar dicha competencia puede ayudar a aliviar los problemas estratégicos en nuestro modelo actual. Otro enfoque interesante para abordar el problema estratégico es considerar los mercados alternativos que son al menos compatibles con incentivos miopicalmente. Un ejemplo es un mecanismo de mercado llamado una regla de puntuación del mercado, sugerida por Hanson [12]. Estos mercados tienen la propiedad de que una mejor estrategia miope de los agentes neutrales de riesgo es ofertar con sinceramente su valor actual esperado de la seguridad. Además, el número de valores involucrados en cada comercio es fijo y conocido públicamente. Si la estructura del mercado es tal que, por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación actual se publica públicamente después del comercio de cada agente, entonces en equilibrio hay un conocimiento común de todas las expectativas de los agentes y, por lo tanto, el teorema 2 se mantiene. El teorema 3 también se aplica en este caso y, por lo tanto, tenemos la misma caracterización para el conjunto de funciones booleanas computables. Esto sugiere que el problema de provocar respuestas veraces puede ser ortogonal al problema de calcular el agregado deseado, que recuerda al principio de revelación [18]. En este artículo, hemos restringido nuestra atención al problema de agregación más simple posible: calcular las funciones booleanas de las entradas booleanas. Las pruebas de los teoremas 3 y 5 también se mantienen si consideramos funciones booleanas de insumos reales, donde la información privada de cada agente es un número real. Además, el Teorema 2 también posee siempre que el mercado alcance el equilibrio. Sin embargo, con entradas reales y distribuciones anteriores arbitrarias, no está claro que el mercado alcance un equilibrio en un número finito de pasos.6. Conclusión 6.1 Resumen Hemos enmarcado el proceso de agregación de información en los mercados como un cálculo de información distribuida. Hemos desarrollado un modelo simplificado de un mercado de la información que creemos que captura muchos de los aspectos importantes de la interacción de agentes reales en un mercado de la información. Dentro de este modelo, demostramos varios resultados que caracterizan con precisión lo que el mercado puede calcular y qué tan rápido. Específicamente, mostramos que el mercado está garantizado para converger al verdadero equilibrio de expectativas racionales si y solo si la función de pago de seguridad es una función umbral ponderada. Probamos que el proceso mediante el cual los agentes revelan su información con el tiempo y aprenden de los precios anunciados resultantes, se necesita en la mayoría de las redes de N para converger al precio correcto de información completa en el peor de los casos. Mostramos que este límite es apretado dentro de un factor de dos.6.2 Trabajo futuro vemos este documento como un primer paso para comprender el poder computacional de los mercados de la información. Algunos pasos interesantes e importantes incluyen obtener una mejor comprensión de lo siguiente: • El efecto de la precisión y la precisión de los precios: hemos asumido que el precio de compensación se conoce con precisión ilimitada;En la práctica, esto no será cierto. Además, hemos descuidado influencias en el precio del mercado que no sea de los comerciantes racionales;El precio de mercado también puede estar influenciado por otros factores, como los comerciantes mal informados o irracionales. Es interesante preguntar qué agregados se pueden calcular incluso en presencia de precios ruidosos.• Actualizaciones incrementales: si los agentes han calculado el valor de la función y se cambia un pequeño número de bits de entrada, ¿se puede calcular el nuevo valor de la función de forma incremental y rápida?• Cálculo distribuido: en nuestro modelo, la información distribuida se agrega a través de un cálculo centralizado 163. En cierto sentido, parte del cálculo en sí se distribuye entre los agentes participantes, pero ¿se puede distribuir el cálculo del mercado también? Por ejemplo, ¿podemos encontrar un buen modelo de computación distribuida de un mercado descentralizado?• Cálculo de los agentes: no hemos tenido en cuenta la complejidad de los cálculos que los agentes deben hacer para actualizar con precisión sus creencias después de cada ronda.• Modelos de mercado estratégico: por razones de simplicidad y tractabilidad, hemos asumido directamente que los agentes ofertan con sinceridad. Un enfoque más satisfactorio sería asumir solo la racionalidad y resolver la estrategia de solución gametheorética resultante, ya sea en nuestro modelo computacional actual u otro modelo de un mercado de la información.• La suposición común-prior: ¿podemos decir algo sobre el comportamiento del mercado cuando los agentes que los antecedentes son solo aproximadamente iguales o cuando difieren mucho?• Análisis de caso promedio: nuestros resultados negativos (teoremas 3 y 5) examinan los peores escenarios de casos y, por lo tanto, implican distribuciones de probabilidad previas muy específicas. Es interesante preguntar si obtendríamos resultados muy diferentes para distribuciones anteriores genéricas.• Diseño del mercado de la información: las funciones que no son de umbral se pueden implementar mediante la colocación de dos o más funciones de umbral juntas. ¿Cuál es el número mínimo de valores de umbral necesarios para implementar una función determinada? Este es exactamente el problema de minimizar el tamaño de una red neuronal, un problema bien estudiado que se sabe que es NP-Hard [15]. ¿Qué configuración de valores puede aproximar mejor a una función dada? ¿Hay formas de definir y configurar valores para acelerar la convergencia al equilibrio? ¿Cuál es la relación entre el aprendizaje automático (por ejemplo, el aprendizaje de la red neuronal) y el diseño del mercado de información?

        "INTRODUCTION The strong form of the efficient markets hypothesis states that market prices nearly instantly incorporate all information available to all traders.",
        "As a result, market prices encode the best forecasts of future outcomes given all information, even if that information is distributed across many sources.",
        "Supporting evidence can be found in empirical studies of options markets [14], political stock markets [7, 8, 22], sports betting markets [3, 9, 27], horse-racing markets [30], market games [23, 24], and laboratory investigations of experimental markets [6, 25, 26].",

        "As trades are made, summary information is revealed through market prices.",
        "Traders learn or infer what information others are likely to have by observing prices, then update their own beliefs based on their observations.",
        "Over time, if the process works as advertised, all information is revealed, and all traders converge to the same information state.",
        "At this point, the market is in what is called a rational expectations equilibrium [11, 16, 19].",
        "All information available to all traders is now reflected in the going prices, and no further trades are desirable until some new information becomes available.",
        "While most markets are not designed with information aggregation as a primary motivation-for example, derivatives 156 markets are intended mainly for risk management and sports betting markets for entertainment-recently, some markets have been created solely for the purpose of aggregating information on a topic of interest.",
        "The Iowa Electronic Market1 is a prime example, operated by the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business for the purpose of investigating how information about political elections distributed among traders gets reflected in securities prices whose payoffs are tied to actual election outcomes [7, 8].",
        "In this paper, we investigate the nature of the computational process whereby distributed information is revealed and combined over time into the prices in information markets.",
        "To do so, in Section 3, we propose a model of an information market that is tractable for theoretical analysis and, we believe, captures much of the important essence of real information markets.",

        "RELATIONSHIP TO RELATED WORK As mentioned, there is a great deal of documented evidence supporting the notion that markets are able to aggregate information in a number of scenarios using a variety of market mechanisms.",
        "The theoretically ideal mechanism requires what is called a complete market.",
        "A complete market contains enough linearly independent securities to span the entire state space of interest [1, 31].",
        "That is, the dimensionality of the available securities equals the dimensionality of the event space over which information is to be aggregated.2 In this ideal case, all private information becomes common knowledge in equilibrium, and thus any function of the private information can be directly evaluated by any agent or observer.",
        "However, this theoretical ideal is almost never achievable in practice, because it generally requires a number of securities exponential in the number of random variables of interest.",
        "When available securities form an incomplete market [17] in relation to the desired information space-as is usually the case-aggregation may be partial.",
        "Not all private information is revealed in equilibrium, and prices may not convey enough information to recover the complete joint probability distribution over all events.",
        "Still, it is generally assumed that aggregation does occur along the dimensions represented in the market; that is, prices do reflect a consistent projection of the entire joint distribution onto the smaller-dimensional space spanned by securities.",
        "In this pa1 http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/ 2 When we refer to independence or dimensionality of securities, we mean the independence or dimensionality of the random variables on which the security payoffs are based. per, we investigate cases in which even this partial aggregation fails.",
        "For example, even though there is enough private information to determine completely the price of a security in the market, the equilibrium price may in fact reveal no information at all!",
        "So characterizations of when a rational expectations equilibrium is fully revealing do not immediately apply to our problem.",
        "We are not asking whether all possible functions of private information can be evaluated, but whether a particular target function can be evaluated.",
        "We show that properties of the function itself play a major role, not just the relative dimensionalities of the information and security spaces.",
        "Our second main contribution is examining the dynamics of information aggregation before equilibrium, in particular proving upper and lower bounds on the time to convergence in those cases in which aggregation succeeds.",
        "Shoham and Tennenholtz [29] define a rationally computable function as a function of agents valuations (types) that can be computed by a market, assuming agents follow rational equilibrium strategies.",
        "The authors mainly consider auctions of goods as their basic mechanistic unit and examine the communication complexity involved in computing various functions of agents valuations of goods.",
        "For example, they give auction mechanisms that can compute the maximum, minimum, and kth-highest of the agents valuations of a single good using 1, 1, and n − k + 1 bits of communication, respectively.",

        "MODEL OF AN INFORMATION MARKET To investigate the properties and limitations of the process whereby an information market converges toward its rational-expectations equilibrium, we formulate a representative model of the market.",
        "In designing the model, our goals were two-fold: (1) to make the model rich enough to be realistic and (2) to make the model simple enough to admit meaningful analysis.",
        "Any modeling decisions must trade off these two generally conflicting goals, and the decision process is as much an art as a science.",
        "Nonetheless, we believe that our model captures enough of the essence of real information markets to lend credence to the results that follow.",
        "In this section, we present our modeling assumptions and justifications in detail.",
        "Section 3.1 describes the initial information state of the system, Section 3.2 covers the market mechanism, and Section 3.3 presents the agents strategies. 3.1 Initial information state There are n agents (traders) in the system, each of whom is privy to one bit of information, denoted xi.",
        "The vector of all n bits is denoted x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn).",
        "In the initial state, each agent is aware only of her own bit of information.",
        "All agents have a common prior regarding the joint distribution of bits among agents, but none has any specific information about the actual value of bits held by others.",
        "Note that this common-prior assumption-typical in the economics literature-does not imply that all agents agree.",
        "To the contrary, because each agent has different information, the initial state of the system is in general a state of disagreement.",
        "Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The security being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits.",
        "The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents.",
        "We sometimes refer to the xi as the input bits.",
        "At some time in the future after trading is completed, the true value of f(x) is revealed,4 and every owner of the security is paid an amount f(x) in cash per unit owned.",
        "If an agent ends with a negative quantity of the security (by selling short), then the agent must pay the amount f(x) in cash per unit.",
        "Note that if someone were to have complete knowledge of all input bits x, then that person would know the true value f(x) of the security with certainty, and so would be willing to buy it at any price lower than f(x) and (short) sell it at any price higher than f(x).5 Following Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik [4], and Jackson and Peck [13], we model the market-price formation process as a multiperiod Shapley-Shubik market game [28].",
        "The Shapley-Shubik process operates as follows: The market proceeds in synchronous rounds.",
        "In each round, each agent i submits a bid bi and a quantity qi.",
        "The semantics are that agent i is supplying a quantity qi of the security and an amount bi of money to be traded in the market.",
        "For simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit or short sales, and so an agents trade is not constrained by her possessions.",
        "The market clears in each round by settling at a single price that balances the trade in that round: The clearing price is p = i bi/ i qi.",
        "At the end of the round, agent i holds a quantity qi proportional to the money she bid: qi = bi/p.",
        "In addition, she is left with an amount of money bi that reflects her net trade at price p: bi = bi − p(qi − qi) = pqi.",
        "Note that agent is net trade in the security is a purchase if p < bi/qi and a sale if p > bi/qi.",
        "After each round, the clearing price p is publicly revealed.",
        "Agents then revise their beliefs according to any information garnered from the new price.",
        "The next round proceeds as the previous.",
        "The process continues until an equilibrium is reached, meaning that prices and bids do not change from one round to the next.",
        "In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for each agent i.",
        "This modeling assumption serves two analytical purposes.",
        "First, it ensures that there is forced trade in every round.",
        "Classic results in economics show that perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have differing information) [20].",
        "There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy.",
        "We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the 3 Common knowledge is information that all agents know, that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad infinitum [5]. 4 The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be publicly revealed. 5 Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money. informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons).",
        "Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple function of the agents bids, p = i bi/n.",
        "We will discuss the implications of alternative market models in Section 5. 3.3 Agent strategies In order to draw formal conclusions about the price evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how agents behave.",
        "Essentially we assume that agents are riskneutral, myopic,6 and bid truthfully: Each agent in each round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which is that agents estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
        "Expectations are computed according to each agents probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes rule when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) becomes available.",
        "We also assume that it is common knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.",
        "Would rational agents actually behave according to this strategy?",
        "Its hard to say.",
        "Certainly, we do not claim that this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.",
        "Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to effect other agents judgments in the following rounds (nonmyopic reasoning).",
        "However, we believe that the strategy outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis.",
        "Solving for a true game-theoretic equilibrium strategy in this setting seems extremely difficult.",
        "Our assumptions seem reasonable when there are enough agents in the system such that extremely complex meta-reasoning is not likely to improve upon simply bidding ones true expected value.",
        "In this case, according the the Shapley-Shubik mechanism, if the clearing price is below an agents expected value that agent will end up buying (increasing expected profit); otherwise, if the clearing price is above the agents expected value, the agent will end up selling (also increasing expected profit). 4.",
        "COMPUTATIONAL PROPERTIES In this section, we study the computational power of information markets for a very simple class of aggregation functions: Boolean functions of n variables.",
        "We characterize the set of Boolean functions that can be computed in our market model for all prior distributions and then prove upper and lower bounds on the worst-case convergence time for these markets.",
        "The information structure we assume is as follows: There are n agents, and each agent i has a single bit of private information xi.",
        "We use x to denote the vector (x1, . . . , xn) of inputs.",
        "All the agents also have a common prior probability distribution P : {0, 1}n → [0, 1] over the values of x.",
        "We define a Boolean aggregate function f(x) : {0, 1}n → {0, 1} that we would like the market to compute.",
        "Note that x, and hence f(x), is completely determined by the combination of all the agents information, but it is not known to any one agent.",
        "The agents trade in a Boolean security F, which pays off $1 if f(x) = 1 and $0 if f(x) = 0.",
        "So an omniscient 6 Risk neutrality implies that each agents utility for the security is linearly related to his or her subjective estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
        "Myopic behavior means that agents treat each round as if it were the final round: They do not reason about how their bids may affect the bids of other agents in future rounds. 158 agent with access to all the agents bits would know the true value of security F-either exactly $1 or exactly $0.",
        "In reality, risk-neutral agents with limited information will value F according to their expectation of its payoff, or Ei[f(x)], where Ei is the expectation operator applied according to agent is probability distribution.",
        "For any function f, trading in F may happen to converge to the true value of f(x) by coincidence if the prior probability distribution is sufficiently degenerate.",
        "More interestingly, we would like to know for which functions f does the price of the security F always converge to f(x) for all prior probability distributions P.7 In Section 4.2, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees convergence.",
        "In Section 4.3, we address the natural follow-up question, by deriving upper and lower bounds on the worst-case number of rounds of trading required for the value of f(x) to be revealed. 4.1 Equilibrium price characterization Our analysis builds on a characterization of the equilibrium price of F that follows from a powerful result on common knowledge of aggregates due to McKelvey and Page [19], later extended by Nielsen et al. [21].",
        "Information markets aim to aggregate the knowledge of all the agents.",
        "Procedurally, this occurs because the agents learn from the markets: The price of the security conveys information to each agent about the knowledge of other agents.",
        "We can model the flow of information through prices as follows.",
        "Let Ω = {0, 1}n be the set of possible values of x; we say that Ω denotes the set of possible states of the world.",
        "The prior P defines everyones initial belief about the likelihood of each state.",
        "As trading proceeds, some possible states can be logically ruled out, but the relative likelihoods among the remaining states are fully determined by the prior P. So the common knowledge after any stage is completely described by the set of states that an external observer-with no information beyond the sequence of prices observed-considers possible (along with the prior).",
        "Similarly, the knowledge of agent i at any point is also completely described by the set of states she considers possible.",
        "We use the notation Sr to denote the common-knowledge possibility set after round r, and Sr i to denote the set of states that agent i considers possible after round r. Initially, the only common knowledge is that the input vector x is in Ω; in other words, the set of states considered possible by an external observer before trading has occurred is the set S0 = Ω.",
        "However, each agent i also knows the value of her bit xi; thus, her knowledge set S0 i is the set {y ∈ Ω|yi = xi}.",
        "Agent is first-round bid is her conditional expectation of the event f(x) = 1 given that x ∈ S0 i .",
        "All the agents bids are processed, and the clearing price p1 is announced.",
        "An external observer could predict agent is bid if he knew the value of xi.",
        "Thus, if he knew the value of x, he could predict the value of p1 .",
        "In other words, the external observer knows the function price1 (x) that relates the first round price to the true state x.",
        "Of course, he does not know the value of x; however, he can rule out any vector x that would have resulted in a different clearing price from the observed price p1 . 7 We assume that the common prior is consistent with x in the sense that it assigns a non-zero probability to the actual value of x.",
        "Thus, the common knowledge after round 1 is the set S1 = {y ∈ S0 | price1 (y) = p1 }.",
        "Agent i knows the common knowledge and, in addition, knows the value of bit xi.",
        "Hence, after every round r, the knowledge of agent i is given by Sr i = {y ∈ Sr |yi = xi}.",
        "Note that, because knowledge can only improve over time, we must always have Sr i ⊆ Sr−1 i and Sr ⊆ Sr−1 .",
        "Thus, only a finite number of changes in each agents knowledge are possible, and so eventually we must converge to an equilibrium after which no player learns any further information.",
        "We use S∞ to denote the common knowledge at this point, and S∞ i to denote agent is knowledge at this point.",
        "Let p∞ denote the clearing price at equilibrium.",
        "Informally, McKelvey and Page [19] show that, if n people with common priors but different information about the likelihood of some event A agree about a suitable aggregate of their individual conditional probabilities, then their individual conditional probabilities of event As occurring must be identical. (The precise definition of suitable is described below.)",
        "There is a strong connection to rational expectation equilibria in markets, which was noted in the original McKelvey-Page paper: The market price of a security is common knowledge at the point of equilibrium.",
        "Thus, if the price is a suitable aggregate of the conditional expectations of all the agents, then in equilibrium they must have identical conditional expectations of the event that the security will pay off. (Note that their information may still be different.)",

        "A function g : n → is called stochastically regular if it can be written in the form g = h ◦ g , where g is stochastically monotone and h is invertible on the range of g .",
        "We can now state the McKelvey-Page result, as generalized by Nielsen et al. [21].",
        "In our context, the following simple theorem statement suffices; more general versions of this theorem can be found in [19, 21].",
        "Theorem 1. (Nielsen et al. [21]) Suppose that, at equilibrium, the n agents have a common prior, but possibly different information, about the value of a random variable F, as described above.",

        "If g is a stochastically regular function and g(p∞ 1 , p∞ 2 , . . . , p∞ n ) is common knowledge, then it must be the case that p∞ 1 = p∞ 2 = · · · = p∞ n = E(F|x ∈ S∞ ) = p∞ In one round of our simplified Shapley-Shubik trading model, the announced price is the mean of the conditional expectations of the n agents.",
        "The mean is a stochastically regular function; hence, Theorem 1 shows that, at equilibrium, all agents have identical conditional expectations of the payoff of the security.",
        "It follows that the equilibrium 159 price p∞ must be exactly the conditional expectations of all agents at equilibrium.",
        "Theorem 1 does not in itself say how the equilibrium is reached.",
        "McKelvey and Page, extending an argument due to Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis [10], show that repeated announcement of the aggregate will eventually result in common knowledge of the aggregate.",
        "In our context, this is achieved by announcing the current price at the end of each round; this will ultimately converge to a state in which all agents bid the same price p∞ .",
        "However, reaching an equilibrium price is not sufficient for the purposes of information aggregation.",
        "We also want the price to reveal the actual value of f(x).",
        "It is possible that the equilibrium price p∞ of the security F will not be either 0 or 1, and so we cannot infer the value of f(x) from it.",
        "Example 1: Consider two agents 1 and 2 with private input bits x1 and x2 respectively.",
        "Suppose the prior probability distribution is uniform, i.e., x = (x1, x2) takes the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1) each with probability 1 4 .",
        "Now, suppose the aggregate function we want to compute is the XOR function, f(x) = x1 ⊕ x2.",
        "To this end, we design a market to trade in a Boolean security F, which will eventually payoff $1 iff x1 ⊕ x2 = 1.",
        "If agent 1 observes x1 = 1, she estimates the expected value of F to be the probability that x2 = 0 (given x1 = 1), which is 1 2 .",
        "If she observes x1 = 0, her expectation of the value of F is the conditional probability that x2 = 1, which is also 1 2 .",
        "Thus, in either case, agent 1 will bid 0.5 for F in the first round.",
        "Similarly, agent 2 will also always bid 0.5 in the first round.",
        "Hence, the first round of trading ends with a clearing price of 0.5.",
        "From this, agent 2 can infer that agent 1 bid 0.5, but this gives her no information about the value of x1-it is still equally likely to be 0 or 1.",
        "Agent 1 also gains no information from the first round of trading, and hence neither agent changes her bid in the following rounds.",
        "Thus, the market reaches equilibrium at this point.",
        "As predicted by Theorem 1, both agents have the same conditional expectation (0.5) at equilibrium.",
        "However, the equilibrium price of the security F does not reveal the value of f(x1, x2), even though the combination of agents information is enough to determine it precisely. 4.2 Characterizing computable aggregates We now give a necessary and sufficient characterization of the class of functions f such that, for any prior distribution on x, the equilibrium price of F will reveal the true value of f. We show that this is exactly the class of weighted threshold functions: Definition 3.",
        "A function f : {0, 1}n → {0, 1} is a weighted threshold function iff there are real constants w1, w2, . . . , wn such that f(x) = 1 iff n i=1 wixi ≥ 1 Theorem 2.",

        "Proof: Let S∞ i denote the possibility set of agent i at equilibrium.",
        "As before, we use p∞ to denote the final trading price at this point.",
        "Note that, by Theorem 1, p∞ is exactly agent is conditional expectation of the value of f(x), given her final possibility set S∞ i .",
        "First, observe that if p∞ is 0 or 1, then we must have f(x) = p∞ , regardless of the form of f. For instance, if p∞ = 1, this means that E(f(y)|y ∈ S∞ ) = 1.",
        "As f(·) can only take the values 0 or 1, it follows that P(f(y) = 1|y ∈ S∞ ) = 1.",
        "The actual value x is always in the final possibility set S∞ , and, furthermore, it must have non-zero prior probability, because it actually occurred.",
        "Hence, it follows that f(x) = 1 in this case.",
        "An identical argument shows that if p∞ = 0, f(x) = 0.",
        "Hence, it is enough to show that, if f is a weighted threshold function, then p∞ is either 0 or 1.",
        "We prove this by contradiction.",
        "Let f(·) be a weighted threshold function corresponding to weights {wi}, and assume that 0 < p∞ < 1.",

        "Thus, Equation (2) can be written as ∀i P(f(y) = 1|y ∈ S∞ , yi = xi) = p∞ (3) Now define J+ i = P(yi = 1|y ∈ S∞ , f(y) = 1) J− i = P(yi = 1|y ∈ S∞ , f(y) = 0) J+ = n i=1 wiJ+ i J− = n i=1 wiJ− i Because by assumption p∞ = 0, 1, both J+ i and J− i are well-defined (for all i): Neither is conditioned on a zeroprobability event.",
        "Claim: Eqs. 1 and 3 imply that J+ i = J− i , for all i.",
        "Proof of claim: We consider the two cases xi = 1 and xi = 0 separately.",
        "Case (i): xi = 1.",
        "We can assume that J− i and J+ i are not both 0 (or else, the claim is trivially true).",

        "When xi = 0, observe that the argument of Case (i) can be used to prove that (1 − J+ i ) = (1 − J− i ).",
        "It immediately follows that J+ i = J− i as well. 2 Hence, we must also have J+ = J− .",
        "But using linearity of expectation, we can also write J+ as J+ = E n i=1 wiyi y ∈ S∞ , f(y) = 1 , 160 and, because f(y) = 1 only when i wiyi ≥ 1, this gives us J+ ≥ 1.",
        "Similarly, J− = E n i=1 wiyi y ∈ S∞ , f(y) = 0 , and thus J− < 1.",
        "This implies J− = J+ , which leads to a contradiction. 2 Perhaps surprisingly, the converse of Theorem 2 also holds: Theorem 3.",
        "Suppose f : {0, 1}n → {0, 1} cannot be expressed as a weighted threshold function.",
        "Then there exists a prior distribution P for which the price of the security F does not converge to the value of f(x).",
        "Proof: We start from a geometric characterization of weighted threshold functions.",
        "Consider the Boolean hypercube {0, 1}n as a set of points in n .",

        "In this case, we show how to construct a prior P for which f(x) is not computed by the market.",
        "Let x∗ ∈ n be a point in H+ ∩ H− .",
        "Because x∗ is in H+ , there exists some points z1 , z2 , . . . , zm and constants λ1, λ2, . . . , λm, such that the following constraints are satisfied: ∀k zk ∈ {0, 1}n , and f(zk ) = 1 ∀k 0 < λk ≤ 1 m k=1 λk = 1 m k=1 λkzk = x∗ Similarly, because x∗ ∈ H− , there are points y1 , y2 , . . . , yl and constants µ1, µ2, . . . , µl, such that ∀j yj ∈ {0, 1}n , and f(yj ) = 0 ∀j 0 < µj ≤ 1 l j=1 µj = 1 l j=1 µj yj = x∗ We now define our prior distribution P as follows: P(zk ) = λk 2 for k = 1, 2, . . . , m P(yj ) = µj 2 for j = 1, 2, . . . , l, and all other points are assigned probability 0.",
        "It is easy to see that this is a valid probability distribution.",
        "Under this distribution P, first observe that P(f(x) = 1) = 1 2 .",
        "Further, for any i such that 0 < x∗ i < 1, we have P(f(x) = 1|xi = 1) = P(f(x) = 1 ∧ xi = 1) P(xi = 1) = x∗ i 2 x∗ i = 1 2 and P(f(x) = 1|xi = 0) = P(f(x) = 1 ∧ xi = 0) P(xi = 0) = (1−x∗ i ) 2 (1 − x∗ i ) = 1 2 For indices i such that x∗ i is 0 or 1 exactly, is private information reveals no additional information under prior P, and so here too we have P(f(x) = 1|xi = 0) = P(f(x) = 1|xi = 1) = 1 2 .",
        "Hence, regardless of her private bit xi, each agent i will bid 0.5 for security F in the first round.",
        "The clearing price of 0.5 also reveals no additional information, and so this is an equilibrium with price p∞ = 0.5 that does not reveal the value of f(x). 2 The XOR function is one example of a function that cannot be expressed as weighted threshold function; Example 1 illustrates Theorem 3 for this function. 4.3 Convergence time bounds We have shown that the class of Boolean functions computable in our model is the class of weighted threshold functions.",
        "The next natural question to ask is: How many rounds of trading are necessary before the equilibrium is reached?",
        "We analyze this problem using the same simplified Shapley-Shubik model of market clearing in each round.",
        "We first prove that, in the worst case, at most n rounds are required.",
        "The idea of the proof is to consider the sequence of common knowledge sets Ω = S0 , S1 , . . ., and show that, until the market reaches equilibrium, each set has a strictly lower dimension than the previous set.",
        "Definition 4.",
        "For a set S ⊆ {0, 1}n , the dimension of set S is the dimension of the smallest linear subspace of n that contains all the points in S; we use the notation dim(S) to denote it.",

        "If Sr = Sr−1 , then dim(Sr ) < dim(Sr−1 ).",
        "Proof: Let k = dim(Sr−1 ).",
        "Consider the bids in round r. In our model, agent i will bid her current expectation for the value of F, br i = E(f(y) = 1|y ∈ Sr−1 , yi = xi).",
        "Thus, depending on the value of xi, br i will take on one of two values h (0) i or h (1) i .",
        "Note that h (0) i and h (1) i depend only on the set Sr−1 , which is common knowledge before round 161 r. Setting di = h (1) i − h (0) i , we can write br i = h (0) i + dixi.",
        "It follows that the clearing price in round r is given by pr = 1 n n i=1 (h (0) i + dixi) (4) All the agents already know all the h (0) i and di values, and they observe the price pr at the end of the rth round.",
        "Thus, they effectively have a linear equation in x1, x2, . . . , xn that they use to improve their knowledge by ruling out any possibility that would not have resulted in price pr .",
        "In other words, after r rounds, the common knowledge set Sr is the intersection of Sr−1 with the hyperplane defined by Equation (4).",
        "It follows that Sr is contained in the intersection of this hyperplane with the k-dimension linear space containing Sr−1 .",
        "If Sr is not equal to Sr−1 , this intersection defines a linear subspace of dimension (k − 1) that contains Sr , and hence Sr has dimension at most (k − 1). 2 Theorem 4.",
        "Let f be a weighted threshold function, and let P be an arbitrary prior probability distribution.",
        "Then, after at most n rounds of trading, the price reaches its equilibrium value p∞ = f(x).",
        "Proof: Consider the sequence of common knowledge sets S0 , S1 , . . ., and let r be the minimum index such that Sr = Sr−1 .",
        "Then, the rth round of trading does not improve any agents knowledge, and thus we must have S∞ = Sr−1 and p∞ = pr−1 .",
        "Observing that dim(S0 ) = n, and applying Lemma 1 to the first r − 1 rounds, we must have (r − 1) ≤ n. Thus, the price reaches its equilibrium value within n rounds. 2 Theorem 4 provides an upper bound of O(n) on the number of rounds required for convergence.",
        "We now show that this bound is tight to within a factor of 2 by constructing a threshold function with 2n inputs and a prior distribution for which it takes n rounds to determine the value of f(x) in the worst case.",
        "The functions we use are the carry-bit functions.",
        "The function Cn takes 2n inputs; for convenience, we write the inputs as x1, x2 . . . , xn, y1, y2, . . . , yn or as a pair (x, y).",

        "For this proof, let us call the agents A1, A2, . . . , An, B1, B2, . . . , Bn, where Ai holds input bit xi, and Bi holds input bit yi.",
        "We first illustrate our technique by proving that computing C2 requires 2 rounds in the worst case.",
        "To do this, we construct a common prior P2 as follows: • The pair (x1, y1) takes on the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) uniformly (i.e., with probability 1 4 each). • We extend this to a distribution on (x1, x2, y1, y2) by specifying the conditional distribution of (x2, y2) given (x1, y1): If (x1, y1) = (1, 1), then (x2, y2) takes the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) with probabilities 1 2 , 1 6 , 1 6 , 1 6 respectively.",
        "Otherwise, (x2, y2) takes the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) with probabilities 1 6 , 1 6 , 1 6 , 1 2 respectively.",
        "Now, suppose x1 turns out to be 1, and consider agent A1s bid in the first round.",
        "It is given by b1 A1 = P(C2(x1, x2, y1, y2) = 1|x1 = 1)) = P(y1 = 1|x1 = 1) · P((x2, y2) = (0, 0)|x1 = 1, y1 = 1) +P(y1 = 0|x1 = 1) · P((x2, y2) = (1, 1)|x1 = 1, y1 = 0) = 1 2 · 1 2 + 1 2 · 1 2 = 1 2 On the other hand, if x1 turns out to be 0, agent A1s bid would be given by b1 A1 = P(C2(x1, x2, y1, y2) = 1|x1 = 0)) = P((x2, y2) = (1, 1)|x1 = 0) = 1 2 Thus, irrespective of her bit, A1 will bid 0.5 in the first round.",
        "Note that the function and distribution are symmetric between x and y, and so the same argument shows that B1 will also bid 0.5 in the first round.",
        "Thus, the price p1 announced at the end of the first round reveals no information about x1 or y1.",
        "The reason this occurs is that, under this distribution, the second carry bit C2 is statistically independent of the first carry bit (x1 ∧ y1); we will use this trick again in the general construction.",
        "Now, suppose that (x2, y2) is either (0, 1) or (1, 0).",
        "Then, even if x2 and y2 are completely revealed by the first-round price, the value of C2(x1, x2, y1, y2) is not revealed: It will be 1 if x1 = y1 = 1 and 0 otherwise.",
        "Thus, we have shown that at least 2 rounds of trading will be required to reveal the function value in this case.",

        "Claim: Under distribution Pn, for all i < n, P(Cn(x, y) = 1|xi = 1) = P(Cn(x, y) = 1|xi = 0). 162 Proof of claim: A similar calculation to that used for C2 above shows that the value of Cn(x, y) under this distribution is statistically independent of Cn−1(x−n , y−n ).",
        "For i < n, xi can affect the value of Cn only through Cn−1.",
        "Also, by contruction of Pn, given the value of Cn−1, the distribution of Cn is independent of xi.",
        "It follows that Cn(x, y) is statistically independent of xi as well.",
        "Of course, a similar result holds for yi by symmetry.",
        "Thus, in the first round, for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, the bids of agents Ai and Bi do not reveal anything about their private information.",
        "Thus, the first-round price does not reveal any information about the value of (x−n , y−n ).",
        "On the other hand, agents An and Bn do have different expectations of Cn(x) depending on whether their input bit is a 0 or a 1; thus, the first-round price does reveal whether neither, one, or both of xn and yn are 1.",
        "Now, consider a situation in which (xn, yn) takes on the value (1, 0) or (0, 1).",
        "We show that, in this case, after one round we are left with the residual problem of computing the value of Cn−1(x−n , y−n ) under the prior Pn−1.",
        "Clearly, when xn + yn = 1, Cn(x, y) = Cn−1(x−n , y−n ).",
        "Further, according to the construction of Pn, the event (xn+ yn = 1) has the same probability (1/3) for all values of (x−n , y−n ).",
        "Thus, conditioning on this fact does not alter the probability distribution over (x−n , y−n ); it must still be Pn−1.",
        "Finally, the inductive assumption tells us that solving this residual problem will take at least n − 1 more rounds in the worst case and hence that finding the value of Cn(x, y) takes at least n rounds in the worst case. 2 5.",
        "DISCUSSION Our results have been derived in a simplified model of an information market.",
        "In this section, we discuss the applicability of these results to more general trading models.",
        "Assuming that agents bid truthfully, Theorem 2 holds in any model in which the price is a known stochastically monotone aggregate of agents bids.",
        "While it seems reasonable that the market price satisfies monotonicity properties, the exact form of the aggregate function may not be known if the volume of each users trades is not observable; this depends on the details of the market process.",
        "Theorem 3 and Theorem 5 hold more generally; they only require that an agents strategy depends only on her conditional expectation of the securitys value.",
        "Perhaps the most fragile result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar dimension-based bound will hold for other families of nonlinear clearing prices.",
        "Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information.",
        "However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information.",
        "Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.",
        "Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible.",
        "One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].",
        "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.",
        "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
        "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
        "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
        "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",
        "In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs.",
        "The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5 also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs, where each agents private information is a real number.",
        "Further, Theorem 2 also holds provided the market reaches equilibrium.",
        "With real inputs and arbitrary prior distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 6.",
        "CONCLUSION 6.1 Summary We have framed the process of information aggregation in markets as a computation on distributed information.",
        "We have developed a simplified model of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market.",
        "Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly.",
        "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security payoff function is a weighted threshold function.",
        "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
        "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
        "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
        "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
        "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
        "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
        "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
        "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
        "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",
        "What is the minimum number of threshold securities required to implement a given function?",
        "This is exactly the problem of minimizing the size of a neural network, a well-studied problem known to be NP-hard [15].",
        "What configuration of securities can best approximate a given function?",
        "Are there ways to define and configure securities to speed up convergence to equilibrium?",

                "For a set S ⊆ {0, 1}n , the dimension of set S is the dimension of the smallest linear subspace of n that contains all the points in S; we use the notation dim(S) to denote it.",

                "If Sr is not equal to Sr−1 , this intersection defines a linear subspace of dimension (k − 1) that contains Sr , and hence Sr has dimension at most (k − 1). 2 Theorem 4.",

                "Note that the function and distribution are symmetric between x and y, and so the same argument shows that B1 will also bid 0.5 in the first round.",
                "Thus, the price p1 announced at the end of the first round reveals no information about x1 or y1.",
                "The reason this occurs is that, under this distribution, the second carry bit C2 is statistically independent of the first carry bit (x1 ∧ y1); we will use this trick again in the general construction.",

                "Then, even if x2 and y2 are completely revealed by the first-round price, the value of C2(x1, x2, y1, y2) is not revealed: It will be 1 if x1 = y1 = 1 and 0 otherwise.",

                "On the other hand, agents An and Bn do have different expectations of Cn(x) depending on whether their input bit is a 0 or a 1; thus, the first-round price does reveal whether neither, one, or both of xn and yn are 1.",

                "Perhaps the most fragile result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar dimension-based bound will hold for other families of nonlinear clearing prices.",
                "Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information.",
                "However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information.",
                "Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.",
                "Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible.",
                "One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].",
                "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.",
                "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",

                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",

                "INTRODUCTION The strong form of the efficient markets hypothesis states that market prices nearly instantly incorporate all information available to all traders.",
                "As a result, market prices encode the best forecasts of future outcomes given all information, even if that information is distributed across many sources.",
                "Supporting evidence can be found in empirical studies of options markets [14], political stock markets [7, 8, 22], sports betting markets [3, 9, 27], horse-racing markets [30], market games [23, 24], and laboratory investigations of experimental markets [6, 25, 26].",

                "At this point, the market is in what is called a rational expectations equilibrium [11, 16, 19].",
                "All information available to all traders is now reflected in the going prices, and no further trades are desirable until some new information becomes available.",
                "While most markets are not designed with information aggregation as a primary motivation-for example, derivatives 156 markets are intended mainly for risk management and sports betting markets for entertainment-recently, some markets have been created solely for the purpose of aggregating information on a topic of interest.",

                "To do so, in Section 3, we propose a model of an information market that is tractable for theoretical analysis and, we believe, captures much of the important essence of real information markets.",

                "RELATIONSHIP TO RELATED WORK As mentioned, there is a great deal of documented evidence supporting the notion that markets are able to aggregate information in a number of scenarios using a variety of market mechanisms.",

                "A complete market contains enough linearly independent securities to span the entire state space of interest [1, 31].",
                "That is, the dimensionality of the available securities equals the dimensionality of the event space over which information is to be aggregated.2 In this ideal case, all private information becomes common knowledge in equilibrium, and thus any function of the private information can be directly evaluated by any agent or observer.",
                "However, this theoretical ideal is almost never achievable in practice, because it generally requires a number of securities exponential in the number of random variables of interest.",
                "When available securities form an incomplete market [17] in relation to the desired information space-as is usually the case-aggregation may be partial.",
                "Not all private information is revealed in equilibrium, and prices may not convey enough information to recover the complete joint probability distribution over all events.",
                "Still, it is generally assumed that aggregation does occur along the dimensions represented in the market; that is, prices do reflect a consistent projection of the entire joint distribution onto the smaller-dimensional space spanned by securities.",
                "In this pa1 http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/ 2 When we refer to independence or dimensionality of securities, we mean the independence or dimensionality of the random variables on which the security payoffs are based. per, we investigate cases in which even this partial aggregation fails.",
                "For example, even though there is enough private information to determine completely the price of a security in the market, the equilibrium price may in fact reveal no information at all!",
                "So characterizations of when a rational expectations equilibrium is fully revealing do not immediately apply to our problem.",
                "We are not asking whether all possible functions of private information can be evaluated, but whether a particular target function can be evaluated.",
                "We show that properties of the function itself play a major role, not just the relative dimensionalities of the information and security spaces.",
                "Our second main contribution is examining the dynamics of information aggregation before equilibrium, in particular proving upper and lower bounds on the time to convergence in those cases in which aggregation succeeds.",

                "In designing the model, our goals were two-fold: (1) to make the model rich enough to be realistic and (2) to make the model simple enough to admit meaningful analysis.",
                "Any modeling decisions must trade off these two generally conflicting goals, and the decision process is as much an art as a science.",
                "Nonetheless, we believe that our model captures enough of the essence of real information markets to lend credence to the results that follow.",
                "In this section, we present our modeling assumptions and justifications in detail.",
                "Section 3.1 describes the initial information state of the system, Section 3.2 covers the market mechanism, and Section 3.3 presents the agents strategies. 3.1 Initial information state There are n agents (traders) in the system, each of whom is privy to one bit of information, denoted xi.",
                "The vector of all n bits is denoted x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn).",
                "In the initial state, each agent is aware only of her own bit of information.",
                "All agents have a common prior regarding the joint distribution of bits among agents, but none has any specific information about the actual value of bits held by others.",
                "Note that this common-prior assumption-typical in the economics literature-does not imply that all agents agree.",
                "To the contrary, because each agent has different information, the initial state of the system is in general a state of disagreement.",
                "Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The security being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits.",
                "The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents.",
                "We sometimes refer to the xi as the input bits.",
                "At some time in the future after trading is completed, the true value of f(x) is revealed,4 and every owner of the security is paid an amount f(x) in cash per unit owned.",
                "If an agent ends with a negative quantity of the security (by selling short), then the agent must pay the amount f(x) in cash per unit.",
                "Note that if someone were to have complete knowledge of all input bits x, then that person would know the true value f(x) of the security with certainty, and so would be willing to buy it at any price lower than f(x) and (short) sell it at any price higher than f(x).5 Following Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik [4], and Jackson and Peck [13], we model the market-price formation process as a multiperiod Shapley-Shubik market game [28].",
                "The Shapley-Shubik process operates as follows: The market proceeds in synchronous rounds.",
                "In each round, each agent i submits a bid bi and a quantity qi.",
                "The semantics are that agent i is supplying a quantity qi of the security and an amount bi of money to be traded in the market.",
                "For simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit or short sales, and so an agents trade is not constrained by her possessions.",
                "The market clears in each round by settling at a single price that balances the trade in that round: The clearing price is p = i bi/ i qi.",
                "At the end of the round, agent i holds a quantity qi proportional to the money she bid: qi = bi/p.",
                "In addition, she is left with an amount of money bi that reflects her net trade at price p: bi = bi − p(qi − qi) = pqi.",
                "Note that agent is net trade in the security is a purchase if p < bi/qi and a sale if p > bi/qi.",
                "After each round, the clearing price p is publicly revealed.",
                "Agents then revise their beliefs according to any information garnered from the new price.",
                "The next round proceeds as the previous.",
                "The process continues until an equilibrium is reached, meaning that prices and bids do not change from one round to the next.",
                "In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for each agent i.",
                "This modeling assumption serves two analytical purposes.",
                "First, it ensures that there is forced trade in every round.",
                "Classic results in economics show that perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have differing information) [20].",
                "There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy.",
                "We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the 3 Common knowledge is information that all agents know, that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad infinitum [5]. 4 The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be publicly revealed. 5 Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money. informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons).",
                "Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple function of the agents bids, p = i bi/n.",
                "We will discuss the implications of alternative market models in Section 5. 3.3 Agent strategies In order to draw formal conclusions about the price evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how agents behave.",
                "Essentially we assume that agents are riskneutral, myopic,6 and bid truthfully: Each agent in each round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which is that agents estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Expectations are computed according to each agents probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes rule when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) becomes available.",
                "We also assume that it is common knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.",
                "Would rational agents actually behave according to this strategy?",
                "Its hard to say.",
                "Certainly, we do not claim that this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.",
                "Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to effect other agents judgments in the following rounds (nonmyopic reasoning).",
                "However, we believe that the strategy outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis.",
                "Solving for a true game-theoretic equilibrium strategy in this setting seems extremely difficult.",
                "Our assumptions seem reasonable when there are enough agents in the system such that extremely complex meta-reasoning is not likely to improve upon simply bidding ones true expected value.",
                "In this case, according the the Shapley-Shubik mechanism, if the clearing price is below an agents expected value that agent will end up buying (increasing expected profit); otherwise, if the clearing price is above the agents expected value, the agent will end up selling (also increasing expected profit). 4.",
                "COMPUTATIONAL PROPERTIES In this section, we study the computational power of information markets for a very simple class of aggregation functions: Boolean functions of n variables.",
                "We characterize the set of Boolean functions that can be computed in our market model for all prior distributions and then prove upper and lower bounds on the worst-case convergence time for these markets.",
                "The information structure we assume is as follows: There are n agents, and each agent i has a single bit of private information xi.",
                "We use x to denote the vector (x1, . . . , xn) of inputs.",
                "All the agents also have a common prior probability distribution P : {0, 1}n → [0, 1] over the values of x.",

                "Note that x, and hence f(x), is completely determined by the combination of all the agents information, but it is not known to any one agent.",
                "The agents trade in a Boolean security F, which pays off $1 if f(x) = 1 and $0 if f(x) = 0.",
                "So an omniscient 6 Risk neutrality implies that each agents utility for the security is linearly related to his or her subjective estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Myopic behavior means that agents treat each round as if it were the final round: They do not reason about how their bids may affect the bids of other agents in future rounds. 158 agent with access to all the agents bits would know the true value of security F-either exactly $1 or exactly $0.",
                "In reality, risk-neutral agents with limited information will value F according to their expectation of its payoff, or Ei[f(x)], where Ei is the expectation operator applied according to agent is probability distribution.",
                "For any function f, trading in F may happen to converge to the true value of f(x) by coincidence if the prior probability distribution is sufficiently degenerate.",
                "More interestingly, we would like to know for which functions f does the price of the security F always converge to f(x) for all prior probability distributions P.7 In Section 4.2, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees convergence.",
                "In Section 4.3, we address the natural follow-up question, by deriving upper and lower bounds on the worst-case number of rounds of trading required for the value of f(x) to be revealed. 4.1 Equilibrium price characterization Our analysis builds on a characterization of the equilibrium price of F that follows from a powerful result on common knowledge of aggregates due to McKelvey and Page [19], later extended by Nielsen et al. [21].",
                "Information markets aim to aggregate the knowledge of all the agents.",
                "Procedurally, this occurs because the agents learn from the markets: The price of the security conveys information to each agent about the knowledge of other agents.",
                "We can model the flow of information through prices as follows.",
                "Let Ω = {0, 1}n be the set of possible values of x; we say that Ω denotes the set of possible states of the world.",
                "The prior P defines everyones initial belief about the likelihood of each state.",
                "As trading proceeds, some possible states can be logically ruled out, but the relative likelihoods among the remaining states are fully determined by the prior P. So the common knowledge after any stage is completely described by the set of states that an external observer-with no information beyond the sequence of prices observed-considers possible (along with the prior).",
                "Similarly, the knowledge of agent i at any point is also completely described by the set of states she considers possible.",
                "We use the notation Sr to denote the common-knowledge possibility set after round r, and Sr i to denote the set of states that agent i considers possible after round r. Initially, the only common knowledge is that the input vector x is in Ω; in other words, the set of states considered possible by an external observer before trading has occurred is the set S0 = Ω.",
                "However, each agent i also knows the value of her bit xi; thus, her knowledge set S0 i is the set {y ∈ Ω|yi = xi}.",
                "Agent is first-round bid is her conditional expectation of the event f(x) = 1 given that x ∈ S0 i .",

                "An external observer could predict agent is bid if he knew the value of xi.",
                "Thus, if he knew the value of x, he could predict the value of p1 .",
                "In other words, the external observer knows the function price1 (x) that relates the first round price to the true state x.",
                "Of course, he does not know the value of x; however, he can rule out any vector x that would have resulted in a different clearing price from the observed price p1 . 7 We assume that the common prior is consistent with x in the sense that it assigns a non-zero probability to the actual value of x.",
                "Thus, the common knowledge after round 1 is the set S1 = {y ∈ S0 | price1 (y) = p1 }.",
                "Agent i knows the common knowledge and, in addition, knows the value of bit xi.",
                "Hence, after every round r, the knowledge of agent i is given by Sr i = {y ∈ Sr |yi = xi}.",
                "Note that, because knowledge can only improve over time, we must always have Sr i ⊆ Sr−1 i and Sr ⊆ Sr−1 .",
                "Thus, only a finite number of changes in each agents knowledge are possible, and so eventually we must converge to an equilibrium after which no player learns any further information.",

                "However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information.",
                "Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.",
                "Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible.",
                "One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].",
                "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.",
                "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",
                "In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs.",
                "The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5 also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs, where each agents private information is a real number.",
                "Further, Theorem 2 also holds provided the market reaches equilibrium.",
                "With real inputs and arbitrary prior distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION 6.1 Summary We have framed the process of information aggregation in markets as a computation on distributed information.",
                "We have developed a simplified model of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market.",
                "Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly.",
                "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security payoff function is a weighted threshold function.",
                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",
                "What is the minimum number of threshold securities required to implement a given function?",
                "This is exactly the problem of minimizing the size of a neural network, a well-studied problem known to be NP-hard [15].",
                "What configuration of securities can best approximate a given function?",
                "Are there ways to define and configure securities to speed up convergence to equilibrium?",

                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",

                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",

                "INTRODUCTION The strong form of the efficient markets hypothesis states that market prices nearly instantly incorporate all information available to all traders.",
                "As a result, market prices encode the best forecasts of future outcomes given all information, even if that information is distributed across many sources.",
                "Supporting evidence can be found in empirical studies of options markets [14], political stock markets [7, 8, 22], sports betting markets [3, 9, 27], horse-racing markets [30], market games [23, 24], and laboratory investigations of experimental markets [6, 25, 26].",

                "Over time, if the process works as advertised, all information is revealed, and all traders converge to the same information state.",
                "At this point, the market is in what is called a rational expectations equilibrium [11, 16, 19].",
                "All information available to all traders is now reflected in the going prices, and no further trades are desirable until some new information becomes available.",
                "While most markets are not designed with information aggregation as a primary motivation-for example, derivatives 156 markets are intended mainly for risk management and sports betting markets for entertainment-recently, some markets have been created solely for the purpose of aggregating information on a topic of interest.",

                "To do so, in Section 3, we propose a model of an information market that is tractable for theoretical analysis and, we believe, captures much of the important essence of real information markets.",

                "RELATIONSHIP TO RELATED WORK As mentioned, there is a great deal of documented evidence supporting the notion that markets are able to aggregate information in a number of scenarios using a variety of market mechanisms.",
                "The theoretically ideal mechanism requires what is called a complete market.",
                "A complete market contains enough linearly independent securities to span the entire state space of interest [1, 31].",
                "That is, the dimensionality of the available securities equals the dimensionality of the event space over which information is to be aggregated.2 In this ideal case, all private information becomes common knowledge in equilibrium, and thus any function of the private information can be directly evaluated by any agent or observer.",
                "However, this theoretical ideal is almost never achievable in practice, because it generally requires a number of securities exponential in the number of random variables of interest.",
                "When available securities form an incomplete market [17] in relation to the desired information space-as is usually the case-aggregation may be partial.",
                "Not all private information is revealed in equilibrium, and prices may not convey enough information to recover the complete joint probability distribution over all events.",
                "Still, it is generally assumed that aggregation does occur along the dimensions represented in the market; that is, prices do reflect a consistent projection of the entire joint distribution onto the smaller-dimensional space spanned by securities.",
                "In this pa1 http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/ 2 When we refer to independence or dimensionality of securities, we mean the independence or dimensionality of the random variables on which the security payoffs are based. per, we investigate cases in which even this partial aggregation fails.",
                "For example, even though there is enough private information to determine completely the price of a security in the market, the equilibrium price may in fact reveal no information at all!",
                "So characterizations of when a rational expectations equilibrium is fully revealing do not immediately apply to our problem.",
                "We are not asking whether all possible functions of private information can be evaluated, but whether a particular target function can be evaluated.",
                "We show that properties of the function itself play a major role, not just the relative dimensionalities of the information and security spaces.",
                "Our second main contribution is examining the dynamics of information aggregation before equilibrium, in particular proving upper and lower bounds on the time to convergence in those cases in which aggregation succeeds.",
                "Shoham and Tennenholtz [29] define a rationally computable function as a function of agents valuations (types) that can be computed by a market, assuming agents follow rational equilibrium strategies.",

                "For example, they give auction mechanisms that can compute the maximum, minimum, and kth-highest of the agents valuations of a single good using 1, 1, and n − k + 1 bits of communication, respectively.",

                "In designing the model, our goals were two-fold: (1) to make the model rich enough to be realistic and (2) to make the model simple enough to admit meaningful analysis.",
                "Any modeling decisions must trade off these two generally conflicting goals, and the decision process is as much an art as a science.",
                "Nonetheless, we believe that our model captures enough of the essence of real information markets to lend credence to the results that follow.",
                "In this section, we present our modeling assumptions and justifications in detail.",
                "Section 3.1 describes the initial information state of the system, Section 3.2 covers the market mechanism, and Section 3.3 presents the agents strategies. 3.1 Initial information state There are n agents (traders) in the system, each of whom is privy to one bit of information, denoted xi.",
                "The vector of all n bits is denoted x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn).",
                "In the initial state, each agent is aware only of her own bit of information.",
                "All agents have a common prior regarding the joint distribution of bits among agents, but none has any specific information about the actual value of bits held by others.",
                "Note that this common-prior assumption-typical in the economics literature-does not imply that all agents agree.",
                "To the contrary, because each agent has different information, the initial state of the system is in general a state of disagreement.",
                "Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The security being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits.",
                "The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents.",
                "We sometimes refer to the xi as the input bits.",
                "At some time in the future after trading is completed, the true value of f(x) is revealed,4 and every owner of the security is paid an amount f(x) in cash per unit owned.",
                "If an agent ends with a negative quantity of the security (by selling short), then the agent must pay the amount f(x) in cash per unit.",
                "Note that if someone were to have complete knowledge of all input bits x, then that person would know the true value f(x) of the security with certainty, and so would be willing to buy it at any price lower than f(x) and (short) sell it at any price higher than f(x).5 Following Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik [4], and Jackson and Peck [13], we model the market-price formation process as a multiperiod Shapley-Shubik market game [28].",
                "The Shapley-Shubik process operates as follows: The market proceeds in synchronous rounds.",
                "In each round, each agent i submits a bid bi and a quantity qi.",
                "The semantics are that agent i is supplying a quantity qi of the security and an amount bi of money to be traded in the market.",
                "For simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit or short sales, and so an agents trade is not constrained by her possessions.",
                "The market clears in each round by settling at a single price that balances the trade in that round: The clearing price is p = i bi/ i qi.",
                "At the end of the round, agent i holds a quantity qi proportional to the money she bid: qi = bi/p.",
                "In addition, she is left with an amount of money bi that reflects her net trade at price p: bi = bi − p(qi − qi) = pqi.",
                "Note that agent is net trade in the security is a purchase if p < bi/qi and a sale if p > bi/qi.",
                "After each round, the clearing price p is publicly revealed.",
                "Agents then revise their beliefs according to any information garnered from the new price.",
                "The next round proceeds as the previous.",
                "The process continues until an equilibrium is reached, meaning that prices and bids do not change from one round to the next.",
                "In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for each agent i.",
                "This modeling assumption serves two analytical purposes.",
                "First, it ensures that there is forced trade in every round.",
                "Classic results in economics show that perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have differing information) [20].",
                "There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy.",
                "We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the 3 Common knowledge is information that all agents know, that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad infinitum [5]. 4 The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be publicly revealed. 5 Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money. informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons).",
                "Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple function of the agents bids, p = i bi/n.",
                "We will discuss the implications of alternative market models in Section 5. 3.3 Agent strategies In order to draw formal conclusions about the price evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how agents behave.",
                "Essentially we assume that agents are riskneutral, myopic,6 and bid truthfully: Each agent in each round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which is that agents estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Expectations are computed according to each agents probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes rule when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) becomes available.",
                "We also assume that it is common knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.",
                "Would rational agents actually behave according to this strategy?",
                "Its hard to say.",
                "Certainly, we do not claim that this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.",
                "Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to effect other agents judgments in the following rounds (nonmyopic reasoning).",
                "However, we believe that the strategy outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis.",
                "Solving for a true game-theoretic equilibrium strategy in this setting seems extremely difficult.",
                "Our assumptions seem reasonable when there are enough agents in the system such that extremely complex meta-reasoning is not likely to improve upon simply bidding ones true expected value.",
                "In this case, according the the Shapley-Shubik mechanism, if the clearing price is below an agents expected value that agent will end up buying (increasing expected profit); otherwise, if the clearing price is above the agents expected value, the agent will end up selling (also increasing expected profit). 4.",
                "COMPUTATIONAL PROPERTIES In this section, we study the computational power of information markets for a very simple class of aggregation functions: Boolean functions of n variables.",
                "We characterize the set of Boolean functions that can be computed in our market model for all prior distributions and then prove upper and lower bounds on the worst-case convergence time for these markets.",
                "The information structure we assume is as follows: There are n agents, and each agent i has a single bit of private information xi.",
                "We use x to denote the vector (x1, . . . , xn) of inputs.",
                "All the agents also have a common prior probability distribution P : {0, 1}n → [0, 1] over the values of x.",
                "We define a Boolean aggregate function f(x) : {0, 1}n → {0, 1} that we would like the market to compute.",
                "Note that x, and hence f(x), is completely determined by the combination of all the agents information, but it is not known to any one agent.",
                "The agents trade in a Boolean security F, which pays off $1 if f(x) = 1 and $0 if f(x) = 0.",
                "So an omniscient 6 Risk neutrality implies that each agents utility for the security is linearly related to his or her subjective estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Myopic behavior means that agents treat each round as if it were the final round: They do not reason about how their bids may affect the bids of other agents in future rounds. 158 agent with access to all the agents bits would know the true value of security F-either exactly $1 or exactly $0.",
                "In reality, risk-neutral agents with limited information will value F according to their expectation of its payoff, or Ei[f(x)], where Ei is the expectation operator applied according to agent is probability distribution.",
                "For any function f, trading in F may happen to converge to the true value of f(x) by coincidence if the prior probability distribution is sufficiently degenerate.",
                "More interestingly, we would like to know for which functions f does the price of the security F always converge to f(x) for all prior probability distributions P.7 In Section 4.2, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees convergence.",
                "In Section 4.3, we address the natural follow-up question, by deriving upper and lower bounds on the worst-case number of rounds of trading required for the value of f(x) to be revealed. 4.1 Equilibrium price characterization Our analysis builds on a characterization of the equilibrium price of F that follows from a powerful result on common knowledge of aggregates due to McKelvey and Page [19], later extended by Nielsen et al. [21].",
                "Information markets aim to aggregate the knowledge of all the agents.",
                "Procedurally, this occurs because the agents learn from the markets: The price of the security conveys information to each agent about the knowledge of other agents.",
                "We can model the flow of information through prices as follows.",
                "Let Ω = {0, 1}n be the set of possible values of x; we say that Ω denotes the set of possible states of the world.",
                "The prior P defines everyones initial belief about the likelihood of each state.",
                "As trading proceeds, some possible states can be logically ruled out, but the relative likelihoods among the remaining states are fully determined by the prior P. So the common knowledge after any stage is completely described by the set of states that an external observer-with no information beyond the sequence of prices observed-considers possible (along with the prior).",
                "Similarly, the knowledge of agent i at any point is also completely described by the set of states she considers possible.",
                "We use the notation Sr to denote the common-knowledge possibility set after round r, and Sr i to denote the set of states that agent i considers possible after round r. Initially, the only common knowledge is that the input vector x is in Ω; in other words, the set of states considered possible by an external observer before trading has occurred is the set S0 = Ω.",
                "However, each agent i also knows the value of her bit xi; thus, her knowledge set S0 i is the set {y ∈ Ω|yi = xi}.",
                "Agent is first-round bid is her conditional expectation of the event f(x) = 1 given that x ∈ S0 i .",

                "An external observer could predict agent is bid if he knew the value of xi.",
                "Thus, if he knew the value of x, he could predict the value of p1 .",
                "In other words, the external observer knows the function price1 (x) that relates the first round price to the true state x.",
                "Of course, he does not know the value of x; however, he can rule out any vector x that would have resulted in a different clearing price from the observed price p1 . 7 We assume that the common prior is consistent with x in the sense that it assigns a non-zero probability to the actual value of x.",
                "Thus, the common knowledge after round 1 is the set S1 = {y ∈ S0 | price1 (y) = p1 }.",
                "Agent i knows the common knowledge and, in addition, knows the value of bit xi.",
                "Hence, after every round r, the knowledge of agent i is given by Sr i = {y ∈ Sr |yi = xi}.",
                "Note that, because knowledge can only improve over time, we must always have Sr i ⊆ Sr−1 i and Sr ⊆ Sr−1 .",

                "DISCUSSION Our results have been derived in a simplified model of an information market.",
                "In this section, we discuss the applicability of these results to more general trading models.",
                "Assuming that agents bid truthfully, Theorem 2 holds in any model in which the price is a known stochastically monotone aggregate of agents bids.",
                "While it seems reasonable that the market price satisfies monotonicity properties, the exact form of the aggregate function may not be known if the volume of each users trades is not observable; this depends on the details of the market process.",
                "Theorem 3 and Theorem 5 hold more generally; they only require that an agents strategy depends only on her conditional expectation of the securitys value.",
                "Perhaps the most fragile result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar dimension-based bound will hold for other families of nonlinear clearing prices.",
                "Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information.",
                "However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information.",
                "Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.",
                "Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible.",
                "One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].",
                "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.",
                "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",
                "In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs.",
                "The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5 also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs, where each agents private information is a real number.",
                "Further, Theorem 2 also holds provided the market reaches equilibrium.",
                "With real inputs and arbitrary prior distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION 6.1 Summary We have framed the process of information aggregation in markets as a computation on distributed information.",
                "We have developed a simplified model of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market.",
                "Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly.",
                "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security payoff function is a weighted threshold function.",
                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",
                "What is the minimum number of threshold securities required to implement a given function?",
                "This is exactly the problem of minimizing the size of a neural network, a well-studied problem known to be NP-hard [15].",

                "Not all private information is revealed in equilibrium, and prices may not convey enough information to recover the complete joint probability distribution over all events.",
                "Still, it is generally assumed that aggregation does occur along the dimensions represented in the market; that is, prices do reflect a consistent projection of the entire joint distribution onto the smaller-dimensional space spanned by securities.",

                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",

                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",

                "However, this theoretical ideal is almost never achievable in practice, because it generally requires a number of securities exponential in the number of random variables of interest.",
                "When available securities form an incomplete market [17] in relation to the desired information space-as is usually the case-aggregation may be partial.",
                "Not all private information is revealed in equilibrium, and prices may not convey enough information to recover the complete joint probability distribution over all events.",
                "Still, it is generally assumed that aggregation does occur along the dimensions represented in the market; that is, prices do reflect a consistent projection of the entire joint distribution onto the smaller-dimensional space spanned by securities.",

                "So characterizations of when a rational expectations equilibrium is fully revealing do not immediately apply to our problem.",
                "We are not asking whether all possible functions of private information can be evaluated, but whether a particular target function can be evaluated.",
                "We show that properties of the function itself play a major role, not just the relative dimensionalities of the information and security spaces.",

                "The vector of all n bits is denoted x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn).",
                "In the initial state, each agent is aware only of her own bit of information.",

                "Note that this common-prior assumption-typical in the economics literature-does not imply that all agents agree.",
                "To the contrary, because each agent has different information, the initial state of the system is in general a state of disagreement.",
                "Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The security being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits.",
                "The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents.",
                "We sometimes refer to the xi as the input bits.",
                "At some time in the future after trading is completed, the true value of f(x) is revealed,4 and every owner of the security is paid an amount f(x) in cash per unit owned.",
                "If an agent ends with a negative quantity of the security (by selling short), then the agent must pay the amount f(x) in cash per unit.",
                "Note that if someone were to have complete knowledge of all input bits x, then that person would know the true value f(x) of the security with certainty, and so would be willing to buy it at any price lower than f(x) and (short) sell it at any price higher than f(x).5 Following Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik [4], and Jackson and Peck [13], we model the market-price formation process as a multiperiod Shapley-Shubik market game [28].",
                "The Shapley-Shubik process operates as follows: The market proceeds in synchronous rounds.",
                "In each round, each agent i submits a bid bi and a quantity qi.",
                "The semantics are that agent i is supplying a quantity qi of the security and an amount bi of money to be traded in the market.",
                "For simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit or short sales, and so an agents trade is not constrained by her possessions.",
                "The market clears in each round by settling at a single price that balances the trade in that round: The clearing price is p = i bi/ i qi.",
                "At the end of the round, agent i holds a quantity qi proportional to the money she bid: qi = bi/p.",
                "In addition, she is left with an amount of money bi that reflects her net trade at price p: bi = bi − p(qi − qi) = pqi.",
                "Note that agent is net trade in the security is a purchase if p < bi/qi and a sale if p > bi/qi.",
                "After each round, the clearing price p is publicly revealed.",
                "Agents then revise their beliefs according to any information garnered from the new price.",
                "The next round proceeds as the previous.",
                "The process continues until an equilibrium is reached, meaning that prices and bids do not change from one round to the next.",
                "In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for each agent i.",
                "This modeling assumption serves two analytical purposes.",
                "First, it ensures that there is forced trade in every round.",
                "Classic results in economics show that perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have differing information) [20].",
                "There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy.",
                "We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the 3 Common knowledge is information that all agents know, that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad infinitum [5]. 4 The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be publicly revealed. 5 Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money. informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons).",
                "Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple function of the agents bids, p = i bi/n.",
                "We will discuss the implications of alternative market models in Section 5. 3.3 Agent strategies In order to draw formal conclusions about the price evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how agents behave.",
                "Essentially we assume that agents are riskneutral, myopic,6 and bid truthfully: Each agent in each round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which is that agents estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Expectations are computed according to each agents probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes rule when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) becomes available.",
                "We also assume that it is common knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.",
                "Would rational agents actually behave according to this strategy?",
                "Its hard to say.",
                "Certainly, we do not claim that this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.",
                "Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to effect other agents judgments in the following rounds (nonmyopic reasoning).",
                "However, we believe that the strategy outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis.",
                "Solving for a true game-theoretic equilibrium strategy in this setting seems extremely difficult.",
                "Our assumptions seem reasonable when there are enough agents in the system such that extremely complex meta-reasoning is not likely to improve upon simply bidding ones true expected value.",
                "In this case, according the the Shapley-Shubik mechanism, if the clearing price is below an agents expected value that agent will end up buying (increasing expected profit); otherwise, if the clearing price is above the agents expected value, the agent will end up selling (also increasing expected profit). 4.",

                "So an omniscient 6 Risk neutrality implies that each agents utility for the security is linearly related to his or her subjective estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Myopic behavior means that agents treat each round as if it were the final round: They do not reason about how their bids may affect the bids of other agents in future rounds. 158 agent with access to all the agents bits would know the true value of security F-either exactly $1 or exactly $0.",
                "In reality, risk-neutral agents with limited information will value F according to their expectation of its payoff, or Ei[f(x)], where Ei is the expectation operator applied according to agent is probability distribution.",
                "For any function f, trading in F may happen to converge to the true value of f(x) by coincidence if the prior probability distribution is sufficiently degenerate.",
                "More interestingly, we would like to know for which functions f does the price of the security F always converge to f(x) for all prior probability distributions P.7 In Section 4.2, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees convergence.",
                "In Section 4.3, we address the natural follow-up question, by deriving upper and lower bounds on the worst-case number of rounds of trading required for the value of f(x) to be revealed. 4.1 Equilibrium price characterization Our analysis builds on a characterization of the equilibrium price of F that follows from a powerful result on common knowledge of aggregates due to McKelvey and Page [19], later extended by Nielsen et al. [21].",
                "Information markets aim to aggregate the knowledge of all the agents.",

                "As trading proceeds, some possible states can be logically ruled out, but the relative likelihoods among the remaining states are fully determined by the prior P. So the common knowledge after any stage is completely described by the set of states that an external observer-with no information beyond the sequence of prices observed-considers possible (along with the prior).",
                "Similarly, the knowledge of agent i at any point is also completely described by the set of states she considers possible.",
                "We use the notation Sr to denote the common-knowledge possibility set after round r, and Sr i to denote the set of states that agent i considers possible after round r. Initially, the only common knowledge is that the input vector x is in Ω; in other words, the set of states considered possible by an external observer before trading has occurred is the set S0 = Ω.",
                "However, each agent i also knows the value of her bit xi; thus, her knowledge set S0 i is the set {y ∈ Ω|yi = xi}.",

                "Theorem 3 and Theorem 5 hold more generally; they only require that an agents strategy depends only on her conditional expectation of the securitys value.",
                "Perhaps the most fragile result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar dimension-based bound will hold for other families of nonlinear clearing prices.",
                "Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information.",
                "However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information.",
                "Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.",
                "Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible.",
                "One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].",
                "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.",
                "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",
                "In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs.",
                "The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5 also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs, where each agents private information is a real number.",
                "Further, Theorem 2 also holds provided the market reaches equilibrium.",
                "With real inputs and arbitrary prior distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION 6.1 Summary We have framed the process of information aggregation in markets as a computation on distributed information.",
                "We have developed a simplified model of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market.",
                "Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly.",
                "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security payoff function is a weighted threshold function.",
                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",
                "What is the minimum number of threshold securities required to implement a given function?",
                "This is exactly the problem of minimizing the size of a neural network, a well-studied problem known to be NP-hard [15].",

                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",

                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",

                "There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy.",

                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",
                "In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs.",
                "The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5 also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs, where each agents private information is a real number.",

                "We have developed a simplified model of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market.",
                "Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly.",
                "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security payoff function is a weighted threshold function.",
                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",
                "What is the minimum number of threshold securities required to implement a given function?",

                "Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The security being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits.",
                "The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents.",

                "For simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit or short sales, and so an agents trade is not constrained by her possessions.",

                "On the other hand, agents An and Bn do have different expectations of Cn(x) depending on whether their input bit is a 0 or a 1; thus, the first-round price does reveal whether neither, one, or both of xn and yn are 1.",

                "While it seems reasonable that the <br>market price</br> satisfies monotonicity properties, the exact form of the aggregate function may not be known if the volume of each users trades is not observable; this depends on the details of the market process.",
                "Theorem 3 and Theorem 5 hold more generally; they only require that an agents strategy depends only on her conditional expectation of the securitys value.",
                "Perhaps the most fragile result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar dimension-based bound will hold for other families of nonlinear clearing prices.",
                "Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information.",
                "However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information.",
                "Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.",
                "Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible.",
                "One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].",
                "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.",
                "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",

                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the <br>market price</br> other than from rational traders; the <br>market price</br> may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",

                "The vector of all n bits is denoted x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn).",
                "In the initial state, each agent is aware only of her own bit of information.",

                "Note that this common-prior assumption-typical in the economics literature-does not imply that all agents agree.",

                "Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The security being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits.",
                "The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents.",

                "Note that if someone were to have complete knowledge of all input bits x, then that person would know the true value f(x) of the security with certainty, and so would be willing to buy it at any price lower than f(x) and (short) sell it at any price higher than f(x).5 Following Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik [4], and Jackson and Peck [13], we model the market-price formation process as a multiperiod Shapley-Shubik market game [28].",

                "For simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit or short sales, and so an agents trade is not constrained by her possessions.",
                "The market clears in each round by settling at a single price that balances the trade in that round: The clearing price is p = i bi/ i qi.",
                "At the end of the round, agent i holds a quantity qi proportional to the money she bid: qi = bi/p.",
                "In addition, she is left with an amount of money bi that reflects her net trade at price p: bi = bi − p(qi − qi) = pqi.",
                "Note that agent is net trade in the security is a purchase if p < bi/qi and a sale if p > bi/qi.",
                "After each round, the clearing price p is publicly revealed.",
                "Agents then revise their beliefs according to any information garnered from the new price.",
                "The next round proceeds as the previous.",
                "The process continues until an equilibrium is reached, meaning that prices and bids do not change from one round to the next.",
                "In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for each agent i.",
                "This modeling assumption serves two analytical purposes.",
                "First, it ensures that there is forced trade in every round.",
                "Classic results in economics show that perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have differing information) [20].",
                "There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy.",
                "We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the 3 Common knowledge is information that all agents know, that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad infinitum [5]. 4 The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be publicly revealed. 5 Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money. informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons).",
                "Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple function of the agents bids, p = i bi/n.",
                "We will discuss the implications of alternative market models in Section 5. 3.3 Agent strategies In order to draw formal conclusions about the price evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how agents behave.",
                "Essentially we assume that agents are riskneutral, myopic,6 and bid truthfully: Each agent in each round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which is that agents estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Expectations are computed according to each agents probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes rule when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) becomes available.",
                "We also assume that it is common knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.",
                "Would rational agents actually behave according to this strategy?",
                "Its hard to say.",
                "Certainly, we do not claim that this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.",
                "Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to effect other agents judgments in the following rounds (nonmyopic reasoning).",
                "However, we believe that the strategy outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis.",
                "Solving for a true game-theoretic equilibrium strategy in this setting seems extremely difficult.",
                "Our assumptions seem reasonable when there are enough agents in the system such that extremely complex meta-reasoning is not likely to improve upon simply bidding ones true expected value.",
                "In this case, according the the Shapley-Shubik mechanism, if the clearing price is below an agents expected value that agent will end up buying (increasing expected profit); otherwise, if the clearing price is above the agents expected value, the agent will end up selling (also increasing expected profit). 4.",

                "So an omniscient 6 Risk neutrality implies that each agents utility for the security is linearly related to his or her subjective estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Myopic behavior means that agents treat each round as if it were the final round: They do not reason about how their bids may affect the bids of other agents in future rounds. 158 agent with access to all the agents bits would know the true value of security F-either exactly $1 or exactly $0.",
                "In reality, risk-neutral agents with limited information will value F according to their expectation of its payoff, or Ei[f(x)], where Ei is the expectation operator applied according to agent is probability distribution.",

                "In Section 4.3, we address the natural follow-up question, by deriving upper and lower bounds on the worst-case number of rounds of trading required for the value of f(x) to be revealed. 4.1 Equilibrium price characterization Our analysis builds on a characterization of the equilibrium price of F that follows from a powerful result on common knowledge of aggregates due to McKelvey and Page [19], later extended by Nielsen et al. [21].",
                "Information markets aim to aggregate the knowledge of all the agents.",

                "As trading proceeds, some possible states can be logically ruled out, but the relative likelihoods among the remaining states are fully determined by the prior P. So the common knowledge after any stage is completely described by the set of states that an external observer-with no information beyond the sequence of prices observed-considers possible (along with the prior).",
                "Similarly, the knowledge of agent i at any point is also completely described by the set of states she considers possible.",
                "We use the notation Sr to denote the common-knowledge possibility set after round r, and Sr i to denote the set of states that agent i considers possible after round r. Initially, the only common knowledge is that the input vector x is in Ω; in other words, the set of states considered possible by an external observer before trading has occurred is the set S0 = Ω.",

                "We have developed a <br>simplified model</br> of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market.",
                "Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly.",
                "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security payoff function is a weighted threshold function.",
                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",
                "What is the minimum number of threshold securities required to implement a given function?",
                "This is exactly the problem of minimizing the size of a neural network, a well-studied problem known to be NP-hard [15].",

                "Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The security being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits.",
                "The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents.",
                "We sometimes refer to the xi as the input bits.",

                "Note that if someone were to have complete knowledge of all input bits x, then that person would know the true value f(x) of the security with certainty, and so would be willing to buy it at any price lower than f(x) and (short) sell it at any price higher than f(x).5 Following Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik [4], and Jackson and Peck [13], we model the market-price formation process as a multiperiod Shapley-Shubik market game [28].",

                "The semantics are that agent i is supplying a quantity qi of the security and an amount bi of money to be traded in the market.",
                "For simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit or short sales, and so an agents trade is not constrained by her possessions.",
                "The market clears in each round by settling at a single price that balances the trade in that round: The clearing price is p = i bi/ i qi.",
                "At the end of the round, agent i holds a quantity qi proportional to the money she bid: qi = bi/p.",
                "In addition, she is left with an amount of money bi that reflects her net trade at price p: bi = bi − p(qi − qi) = pqi.",
                "Note that agent is net trade in the security is a purchase if p < bi/qi and a sale if p > bi/qi.",
                "After each round, the clearing price p is publicly revealed.",

                "We now show that this bound is tight to within a factor of 2 by constructing a threshold function with 2n inputs and a prior distribution for which it takes n rounds to determine the value of f(x) in the worst case.",

                "Note that the function and distribution are symmetric between x and y, and so the same argument shows that B1 will also bid 0.5 in the first round.",
                "Thus, the price p1 announced at the end of the first round reveals no information about x1 or y1.",
                "The reason this occurs is that, under this distribution, the second carry bit C2 is statistically independent of the first carry bit (x1 ∧ y1); we will use this trick again in the general construction.",

                "Claim: Under distribution Pn, for all i < n, P(Cn(x, y) = 1|xi = 1) = P(Cn(x, y) = 1|xi = 0). 162 Proof of claim: A similar calculation to that used for C2 above shows that the value of Cn(x, y) under this distribution is statistically independent of Cn−1(x−n , y−n ).",
                "For i < n, xi can affect the value of Cn only through Cn−1.",
                "Also, by contruction of Pn, given the value of Cn−1, the distribution of Cn is independent of xi.",
                "It follows that Cn(x, y) is statistically independent of xi as well.",
                "Of course, a similar result holds for yi by symmetry.",
                "Thus, in the first round, for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, the bids of agents Ai and Bi do not reveal anything about their private information.",
                "Thus, the first-round price does not reveal any information about the value of (x−n , y−n ).",
                "On the other hand, agents An and Bn do have different expectations of Cn(x) depending on whether their input bit is a 0 or a 1; thus, the first-round price does reveal whether neither, one, or both of xn and yn are 1.",
                "Now, consider a situation in which (xn, yn) takes on the value (1, 0) or (0, 1).",
                "We show that, in this case, after one round we are left with the residual problem of computing the value of Cn−1(x−n , y−n ) under the prior Pn−1.",
                "Clearly, when xn + yn = 1, Cn(x, y) = Cn−1(x−n , y−n ).",
                "Further, according to the construction of Pn, the event (xn+ yn = 1) has the same probability (1/3) for all values of (x−n , y−n ).",
                "Thus, conditioning on this fact does not alter the probability distribution over (x−n , y−n ); it must still be Pn−1.",
                "Finally, the inductive assumption tells us that solving this residual problem will take at least n − 1 more rounds in the worst case and hence that finding the value of Cn(x, y) takes at least n rounds in the worst case. 2 5.",

                "Assuming that agents bid truthfully, Theorem 2 holds in any model in which the price is a known stochastically monotone aggregate of agents bids.",
                "While it seems reasonable that the market price satisfies monotonicity properties, the exact form of the aggregate function may not be known if the volume of each users trades is not observable; this depends on the details of the market process.",
                "Theorem 3 and Theorem 5 hold more generally; they only require that an agents strategy depends only on her conditional expectation of the securitys value.",
                "Perhaps the most fragile result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar dimension-based bound will hold for other families of nonlinear clearing prices.",
                "Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information.",
                "However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information.",
                "Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.",
                "Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible.",
                "One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].",
                "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.",
                "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",
                "In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs.",
                "The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5 also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs, where each agents private information is a real number.",
                "Further, Theorem 2 also holds provided the market reaches equilibrium.",
                "With real inputs and arbitrary prior distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION 6.1 Summary We have framed the process of information aggregation in markets as a computation on distributed information.",
                "We have developed a simplified model of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market.",
                "Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly.",
                "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security payoff function is a weighted threshold function.",
                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",

                "All information available to all traders is now reflected in the going prices, and no further trades are desirable until some new information becomes available.",
                "While most markets are not designed with information aggregation as a primary motivation-for example, derivatives 156 markets are intended mainly for risk management and sports betting markets for entertainment-recently, some markets have been created solely for the purpose of aggregating information on a topic of interest.",

                "RELATIONSHIP TO RELATED WORK As mentioned, there is a great deal of documented evidence supporting the notion that markets are able to aggregate information in a number of scenarios using a variety of market mechanisms.",

                "A complete market contains enough linearly independent securities to span the entire state space of interest [1, 31].",
                "That is, the dimensionality of the available securities equals the dimensionality of the event space over which information is to be aggregated.2 In this ideal case, all private information becomes common knowledge in equilibrium, and thus any function of the private information can be directly evaluated by any agent or observer.",
                "However, this theoretical ideal is almost never achievable in practice, because it generally requires a number of securities exponential in the number of random variables of interest.",
                "When available securities form an incomplete market [17] in relation to the desired information space-as is usually the case-aggregation may be partial.",
                "Not all private information is revealed in equilibrium, and prices may not convey enough information to recover the complete joint probability distribution over all events.",
                "Still, it is generally assumed that aggregation does occur along the dimensions represented in the market; that is, prices do reflect a consistent projection of the entire joint distribution onto the smaller-dimensional space spanned by securities.",
                "In this pa1 http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/ 2 When we refer to independence or dimensionality of securities, we mean the independence or dimensionality of the random variables on which the <br>security</br> payoffs are based. per, we investigate cases in which even this partial aggregation fails.",
                "For example, even though there is enough private information to determine completely the price of a <br>security</br> in the market, the equilibrium price may in fact reveal no information at all!",
                "So characterizations of when a rational expectations equilibrium is fully revealing do not immediately apply to our problem.",
                "We are not asking whether all possible functions of private information can be evaluated, but whether a particular target function can be evaluated.",
                "We show that properties of the function itself play a major role, not just the relative dimensionalities of the information and <br>security</br> spaces.",

                "Any modeling decisions must trade off these two generally conflicting goals, and the decision process is as much an art as a science.",
                "Nonetheless, we believe that our model captures enough of the essence of real information markets to lend credence to the results that follow.",
                "In this section, we present our modeling assumptions and justifications in detail.",
                "Section 3.1 describes the initial information state of the system, Section 3.2 covers the market mechanism, and Section 3.3 presents the agents strategies. 3.1 Initial information state There are n agents (traders) in the system, each of whom is privy to one bit of information, denoted xi.",
                "The vector of all n bits is denoted x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn).",
                "In the initial state, each agent is aware only of her own bit of information.",
                "All agents have a common prior regarding the joint distribution of bits among agents, but none has any specific information about the actual value of bits held by others.",
                "Note that this common-prior assumption-typical in the economics literature-does not imply that all agents agree.",
                "To the contrary, because each agent has different information, the initial state of the system is in general a state of disagreement.",
                "Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The <br>security</br> being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits.",
                "The form of f (the description of the <br>security</br>) is common knowledge3 among agents.",
                "We sometimes refer to the xi as the input bits.",
                "At some time in the future after trading is completed, the true value of f(x) is revealed,4 and every owner of the <br>security</br> is paid an amount f(x) in cash per unit owned.",
                "If an agent ends with a negative quantity of the <br>security</br> (by selling short), then the agent must pay the amount f(x) in cash per unit.",
                "Note that if someone were to have complete knowledge of all input bits x, then that person would know the true value f(x) of the <br>security</br> with certainty, and so would be willing to buy it at any price lower than f(x) and (short) sell it at any price higher than f(x).5 Following Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik [4], and Jackson and Peck [13], we model the market-price formation process as a multiperiod Shapley-Shubik market game [28].",
                "The Shapley-Shubik process operates as follows: The market proceeds in synchronous rounds.",
                "In each round, each agent i submits a bid bi and a quantity qi.",
                "The semantics are that agent i is supplying a quantity qi of the <br>security</br> and an amount bi of money to be traded in the market.",
                "For simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit or short sales, and so an agents trade is not constrained by her possessions.",
                "The market clears in each round by settling at a single price that balances the trade in that round: The clearing price is p = i bi/ i qi.",
                "At the end of the round, agent i holds a quantity qi proportional to the money she bid: qi = bi/p.",
                "In addition, she is left with an amount of money bi that reflects her net trade at price p: bi = bi − p(qi − qi) = pqi.",
                "Note that agent is net trade in the <br>security</br> is a purchase if p < bi/qi and a sale if p > bi/qi.",
                "After each round, the clearing price p is publicly revealed.",
                "Agents then revise their beliefs according to any information garnered from the new price.",
                "The next round proceeds as the previous.",
                "The process continues until an equilibrium is reached, meaning that prices and bids do not change from one round to the next.",
                "In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for each agent i.",
                "This modeling assumption serves two analytical purposes.",
                "First, it ensures that there is forced trade in every round.",
                "Classic results in economics show that perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have differing information) [20].",
                "There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy.",
                "We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the 3 Common knowledge is information that all agents know, that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad infinitum [5]. 4 The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be publicly revealed. 5 Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money. informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons).",
                "Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple function of the agents bids, p = i bi/n.",
                "We will discuss the implications of alternative market models in Section 5. 3.3 Agent strategies In order to draw formal conclusions about the price evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how agents behave.",
                "Essentially we assume that agents are riskneutral, myopic,6 and bid truthfully: Each agent in each round bids his or her current valuation of the <br>security</br>, which is that agents estimation of the expected payoff of the <br>security</br>.",
                "Expectations are computed according to each agents probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes rule when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) becomes available.",
                "We also assume that it is common knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.",
                "Would rational agents actually behave according to this strategy?",
                "Its hard to say.",
                "Certainly, we do not claim that this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.",

                "Note that the function and distribution are symmetric between x and y, and so the same argument shows that B1 will also bid 0.5 in the first round.",
                "Thus, the price p1 announced at the end of the first round reveals no information about x1 or y1.",
                "The reason this occurs is that, under this distribution, the second carry bit C2 is statistically independent of the first carry bit (x1 ∧ y1); we will use this trick again in the general construction.",

                "Assuming that agents bid truthfully, Theorem 2 holds in any model in which the price is a known stochastically monotone aggregate of agents bids.",
                "While it seems reasonable that the market price satisfies monotonicity properties, the exact form of the aggregate function may not be known if the volume of each users trades is not observable; this depends on the details of the market process.",
                "Theorem 3 and Theorem 5 hold more generally; they only require that an agents strategy depends only on her conditional expectation of the securitys value.",
                "Perhaps the most fragile result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar dimension-based bound will hold for other families of nonlinear clearing prices.",
                "Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information.",
                "However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information.",
                "Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.",
                "Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible.",
                "One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].",
                "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the <br>security</br>.",
                "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",
                "In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs.",
                "The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5 also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs, where each agents private information is a real number.",
                "Further, Theorem 2 also holds provided the market reaches equilibrium.",
                "With real inputs and arbitrary prior distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION 6.1 Summary We have framed the process of information aggregation in markets as a computation on distributed information.",
                "We have developed a simplified model of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market.",
                "Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly.",
                "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the <br>security</br> payoff function is a weighted threshold function.",
                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",
                "What is the minimum number of threshold securities required to implement a given function?",

                "We are not asking whether all possible functions of private information can be evaluated, but whether a particular target function can be evaluated.",
                "We show that properties of the function itself play a major role, not just the relative dimensionalities of the information and security spaces.",

                "In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for each agent i.",
                "This modeling assumption serves two analytical purposes.",
                "First, it ensures that there is forced trade in every round.",
                "Classic results in economics show that perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have differing information) [20].",
                "There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy.",
                "We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the 3 Common knowledge is information that all agents know, that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad infinitum [5]. 4 The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be publicly revealed. 5 Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money. informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons).",
                "Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple function of the agents bids, p = i bi/n.",
                "We will discuss the implications of alternative market models in Section 5. 3.3 Agent strategies In order to draw formal conclusions about the price evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how agents behave.",
                "Essentially we assume that agents are riskneutral, myopic,6 and bid truthfully: Each agent in each round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which is that agents estimation of the expected <br>payoff</br> of the security.",
                "Expectations are computed according to each agents probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes rule when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) becomes available.",
                "We also assume that it is common knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.",
                "Would rational agents actually behave according to this strategy?",
                "Its hard to say.",
                "Certainly, we do not claim that this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.",
                "Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to effect other agents judgments in the following rounds (nonmyopic reasoning).",
                "However, we believe that the strategy outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis.",

                "As trading proceeds, some possible states can be logically ruled out, but the relative likelihoods among the remaining states are fully determined by the prior P. So the common knowledge after any stage is completely described by the set of states that an external observer-with no information beyond the sequence of prices observed-considers possible (along with the prior).",
                "Similarly, the knowledge of agent i at any point is also completely described by the set of states she considers possible.",

Initially, the only common knowledge is that the input vector x is in Ω; in other words, the set of states considered possible by an external observer before trading has occurred is the set S0 = Ω.",

                "DISCUSSION Our results have been derived in a simplified model of an information market.",
                "In this section, we discuss the applicability of these results to more general trading models.",
                "Assuming that agents bid truthfully, Theorem 2 holds in any model in which the price is a known stochastically monotone aggregate of agents bids.",
                "While it seems reasonable that the market price satisfies monotonicity properties, the exact form of the aggregate function may not be known if the volume of each users trades is not observable; this depends on the details of the market process.",
                "Theorem 3 and Theorem 5 hold more generally; they only require that an agents strategy depends only on her conditional expectation of the securitys value.",
                "Perhaps the most fragile result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar dimension-based bound will hold for other families of nonlinear clearing prices.",
                "Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information.",
                "However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information.",
                "Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.",
                "Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible.",
                "One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].",
                "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.",
                "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",
                "In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs.",
                "The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5 also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs, where each agents private information is a real number.",
                "Further, Theorem 2 also holds provided the market reaches equilibrium.",
                "With real inputs and arbitrary prior distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION 6.1 Summary We have framed the process of information aggregation in markets as a computation on distributed information.",
                "We have developed a simplified model of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market.",
                "Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly.",
                "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security <br>payoff</br> function is a weighted threshold function.",
                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",
                "What is the minimum number of threshold securities required to implement a given function?",

                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",

                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",

                "Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The security being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits.",
                "The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents.",

                "For simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit or short sales, and so an agents trade is not constrained by her possessions.",
                "The market clears in each round by settling at a single price that balances the trade in that round: The clearing price is p = i bi/ i qi.",
                "At the end of the round, agent i holds a quantity qi proportional to the money she bid: qi = bi/p.",
                "In addition, she is left with an amount of money bi that reflects her net trade at price p: bi = bi − p(qi − qi) = pqi.",
                "Note that agent is net trade in the security is a purchase if p < bi/qi and a sale if p > bi/qi.",
                "After each round, the clearing price p is publicly revealed.",
                "Agents then revise their beliefs according to any information garnered from the new price.",
                "The next round proceeds as the previous.",
                "The process continues until an equilibrium is reached, meaning that prices and bids do not change from one round to the next.",
                "In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for each agent i.",
                "This modeling assumption serves two analytical purposes.",
                "First, it ensures that there is forced trade in every round.",
                "Classic results in economics show that perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have differing information) [20].",
                "There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy.",
                "We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the 3 Common knowledge is information that all agents know, that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad infinitum [5]. 4 The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be publicly revealed. 5 Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money. informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons).",
                "Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple function of the agents bids, p = i bi/n.",
                "We will discuss the implications of alternative market models in Section 5. 3.3 Agent strategies In order to draw formal conclusions about the price evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how agents behave.",
                "Essentially we assume that agents are riskneutral, myopic,6 and bid truthfully: Each agent in each round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which is that agents estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Expectations are computed according to each agents <br>probability distribution</br>, which is updated via Bayes rule when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) becomes available.",
                "We also assume that it is common knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.",
                "Would rational agents actually behave according to this strategy?",
                "Its hard to say.",
                "Certainly, we do not claim that this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.",
                "Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to effect other agents judgments in the following rounds (nonmyopic reasoning).",
                "However, we believe that the strategy outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis.",
                "Solving for a true game-theoretic equilibrium strategy in this setting seems extremely difficult.",
                "Our assumptions seem reasonable when there are enough agents in the system such that extremely complex meta-reasoning is not likely to improve upon simply bidding ones true expected value.",
                "In this case, according the the Shapley-Shubik mechanism, if the clearing price is below an agents expected value that agent will end up buying (increasing expected profit); otherwise, if the clearing price is above the agents expected value, the agent will end up selling (also increasing expected profit). 4.",

                "In reality, risk-neutral agents with limited information will value F according to their expectation of its payoff, or Ei[f(x)], where Ei is the expectation operator applied according to agent is <br>probability distribution</br>.",

[21].",

                "As trading proceeds, some possible states can be logically ruled out, but the relative likelihoods among the remaining states are fully determined by the prior P.

                "Otherwise, (xn, yn) takes the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) with probabilities 1 6 , 1 6 , 1 6 , 1 2 respectively.",
                "Claim: Under distribution Pn, for all i < n, P(Cn(x, y) = 1|xi = 1) = P(Cn(x, y) = 1|xi = 0). 162 Proof of claim: A similar calculation to that used for C2 above shows that the value of Cn(x, y) under this distribution is statistically independent of Cn−1(x−n , y−n ).",
                "For i < n, xi can affect the value of Cn only through Cn−1.",
                "Also, by contruction of Pn, given the value of Cn−1, the distribution of Cn is independent of xi.",
                "It follows that Cn(x, y) is statistically independent of xi as well.",
                "Of course, a similar result holds for yi by symmetry.",
                "Thus, in the first round, for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, the bids of agents Ai and Bi do not reveal anything about their private information.",
                "Thus, the first-round price does not reveal any information about the value of (x−n , y−n ).",
                "On the other hand, agents An and Bn do have different expectations of Cn(x) depending on whether their input bit is a 0 or a 1; thus, the first-round price does reveal whether neither, one, or both of xn and yn are 1.",
                "Now, consider a situation in which (xn, yn) takes on the value (1, 0) or (0, 1).",
                "We show that, in this case, after one round we are left with the residual problem of computing the value of Cn−1(x−n , y−n ) under the prior Pn−1.",
                "Clearly, when xn + yn = 1, Cn(x, y) = Cn−1(x−n , y−n ).",
                "Further, according to the construction of Pn, the event (xn+ yn = 1) has the same probability (1/3) for all values of (x−n , y−n ).",
                "Thus, conditioning on this fact does not alter the <br>probability distribution</br> over (x−n , y−n ); it must still be Pn−1.",
                "Finally, the inductive assumption tells us that solving this residual problem will take at least n − 1 more rounds in the worst case and hence that finding the value of Cn(x, y) takes at least n rounds in the worst case. 2 5.",
                "DISCUSSION Our results have been derived in a simplified model of an information market.",
                "In this section, we discuss the applicability of these results to more general trading models.",
                "Assuming that agents bid truthfully, Theorem 2 holds in any model in which the price is a known stochastically monotone aggregate of agents bids.",
                "While it seems reasonable that the market price satisfies monotonicity properties, the exact form of the aggregate function may not be known if the volume of each users trades is not observable; this depends on the details of the market process.",
                "Theorem 3 and Theorem 5 hold more generally; they only require that an agents strategy depends only on her conditional expectation of the securitys value.",
                "Perhaps the most fragile result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar dimension-based bound will hold for other families of nonlinear clearing prices.",
                "Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information.",
                "However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information.",
                "Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.",
                "Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible.",
                "One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].",
                "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.",
                "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",
                "In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs.",
                "The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5 also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs, where each agents private information is a real number.",
                "Further, Theorem 2 also holds provided the market reaches equilibrium.",
                "With real inputs and arbitrary prior distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION 6.1 Summary We have framed the process of information aggregation in markets as a computation on distributed information.",
                "We have developed a simplified model of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market.",
                "Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly.",
                "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security payoff function is a weighted threshold function.",
                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",
                "What is the minimum number of threshold securities required to implement a given function?",
                "This is exactly the problem of minimizing the size of a neural network, a well-studied problem known to be NP-hard [15].",

                "However, this theoretical ideal is almost never achievable in practice, because it generally requires a number of securities exponential in the number of random variables of interest.",

                "Not all private information is revealed in equilibrium, and prices may not convey enough information to recover the complete joint probability distribution over all events.",
                "Still, it is generally assumed that aggregation does occur along the dimensions represented in the market; that is, prices do reflect a consistent projection of the entire joint distribution onto the smaller-dimensional space spanned by securities.",
                "In this pa1 http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/ 2 When we refer to independence or dimensionality of securities, we mean the independence or dimensionality of the random variables on which the security payoffs are based. per, we investigate cases in which even this partial aggregation fails.",

                "So characterizations of when a rational expectations equilibrium is fully revealing do not immediately apply to our problem.",
                "We are not asking whether all possible functions of private information can be evaluated, but whether a particular target function can be evaluated.",
                "We show that properties of the function itself play a major role, not just the relative dimensionalities of the information and security spaces.",
                "Our second main contribution is examining the dynamics of information aggregation before equilibrium, in particular proving upper and lower bounds on the time to convergence in those cases in which aggregation succeeds.",

                "Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.",

                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",

                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",

                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",

                "The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents.",

                "In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for each agent i.",
                "This modeling assumption serves two analytical purposes.",
                "First, it ensures that there is forced trade in every round.",
                "Classic results in economics show that perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have differing information) [20].",
                "There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy.",
                "We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the 3 Common knowledge is information that all agents know, that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad infinitum [5]. 4 The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be publicly revealed. 5 Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money. informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons).",
                "Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple function of the agents bids, p = i bi/n.",
                "We will discuss the implications of alternative market models in Section 5. 3.3 Agent strategies In order to draw formal conclusions about the price evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how agents behave.",
                "Essentially we assume that agents are riskneutral, myopic,6 and bid truthfully: Each agent in each round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which is that agents estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Expectations are computed according to each agents probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes rule when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) becomes available.",
                "We also assume that it is common knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.",
                "Would rational agents actually behave according to this strategy?",
                "Its hard to say.",
                "Certainly, we do not claim that this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.",
                "Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to effect other agents judgments in the following rounds (nonmyopic reasoning).",
                "However, we believe that the strategy outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis.",
                "Solving for a true game-theoretic equilibrium strategy in this setting seems extremely difficult.",
                "Our assumptions seem reasonable when there are enough agents in the system such that extremely complex meta-reasoning is not likely to improve upon simply bidding ones true expected value.",
                "In this case, according the the Shapley-Shubik mechanism, if the clearing price is below an agents expected value that agent will end up buying (increasing expected profit); otherwise, if the clearing price is above the agents expected value, the agent will end up selling (also increasing expected profit). 4.",

                "As trading proceeds, some possible states can be logically ruled out, but the relative likelihoods among the remaining states are fully determined by the prior P. So the common knowledge after any stage is completely described by the set of states that an external observer-with no information beyond the sequence of prices observed-considers possible (along with the prior).",
                "Similarly, the knowledge of agent i at any point is also completely described by the set of states she considers possible.",

Initially, the only common knowledge is that the input vector x is in Ω; in other words, the set of states considered possible by an external observer before trading has occurred is the set S0 = Ω.",

                "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.",
                "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",
                "In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs.",
                "The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5 also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs, where each agents private information is a real number.",
                "Further, Theorem 2 also holds provided the market reaches equilibrium.",
                "With real inputs and arbitrary prior distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION 6.1 Summary We have framed the process of information aggregation in markets as a computation on distributed information.",
                "We have developed a simplified model of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market.",
                "Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly.",
                "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security payoff function is a weighted threshold function.",
                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",
                "What is the minimum number of threshold securities required to implement a given function?",
                "This is exactly the problem of minimizing the size of a neural network, a well-studied problem known to be NP-hard [15].",

                "Thus, the first-round price does not reveal any information about the value of (x−n , y−n ).",
                "On the other hand, agents An and Bn do have different expectations of Cn(x) depending on whether their input bit is a 0 or a 1; thus, the first-round price does reveal whether neither, one, or both of xn and yn are 1.",

                "Further, according to the construction of Pn, the event (xn+ yn = 1) has the same probability (1/3) for all values of (x−n , y−n ).",
                "Thus, conditioning on this fact does not alter the probability distribution over (x−n , y−n ); it must still be Pn−1.",
                "Finally, the inductive assumption tells us that solving this residual problem will take at least n − 1 more rounds in the worst case and hence that finding the value of Cn(x, y) takes at least n rounds in the worst case. 2 5.",

                "Perhaps the most fragile result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar dimension-based bound will hold for other families of nonlinear clearing prices.",
                "Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information.",
                "However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information.",
                "Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.",
                "Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible.",
                "One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].",
                "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.",
                "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",

                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, <br>distributed information</br> is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",

                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",

                "INTRODUCTION The strong form of the efficient markets hypothesis states that market prices nearly instantly incorporate all information available to all traders.",
                "As a result, market prices encode the best forecasts of future outcomes given all information, even if that information is distributed across many sources.",
                "Supporting evidence can be found in empirical studies of options markets [14], political stock markets [7, 8, 22], sports betting markets [3, 9, 27], horse-racing markets [30], market games [23, 24], and laboratory investigations of experimental markets [6, 25, 26].",

                "Over time, if the process works as advertised, all information is revealed, and all traders converge to the same information state.",
                "At this point, the market is in what is called a rational expectations equilibrium [11, 16, 19].",
                "All information available to all traders is now reflected in the going prices, and no further trades are desirable until some new information becomes available.",
                "While most markets are not designed with information aggregation as a primary motivation-for example, derivatives 156 markets are intended mainly for risk management and sports betting markets for entertainment-recently, some markets have been created solely for the purpose of aggregating information on a topic of interest.",
                "The Iowa Electronic Market1 is a prime example, operated by the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business for the purpose of investigating how information about political elections distributed among traders gets reflected in securities prices whose payoffs are tied to actual election outcomes [7, 8].",
                "In this paper, we investigate the nature of the computational process whereby distributed information is revealed and combined over time into the prices in information markets.",
                "To do so, in Section 3, we propose a model of an information market that is tractable for theoretical analysis and, we believe, captures much of the important essence of real information markets.",

                "RELATIONSHIP TO RELATED WORK As mentioned, there is a great deal of documented evidence supporting the notion that markets are able to aggregate information in a number of scenarios using a variety of market mechanisms.",
                "The theoretically ideal mechanism requires what is called a complete market.",
                "A complete market contains enough linearly independent securities to span the entire state space of interest [1, 31].",
                "That is, the dimensionality of the available securities equals the dimensionality of the event space over which information is to be aggregated.2 In this ideal case, all private information becomes common knowledge in equilibrium, and thus any function of the private information can be directly evaluated by any agent or observer.",
                "However, this theoretical ideal is almost never achievable in practice, because it generally requires a number of securities exponential in the number of random variables of interest.",
                "When available securities form an incomplete market [17] in relation to the desired information space-as is usually the case-aggregation may be partial.",
                "Not all private information is revealed in equilibrium, and prices may not convey enough information to recover the complete joint probability distribution over all events.",
                "Still, it is generally assumed that aggregation does occur along the dimensions represented in the market; that is, prices do reflect a consistent projection of the entire joint distribution onto the smaller-dimensional space spanned by securities.",
                "In this pa1 http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/ 2 When we refer to independence or dimensionality of securities, we mean the independence or dimensionality of the random variables on which the security payoffs are based. per, we investigate cases in which even this partial aggregation fails.",
                "For example, even though there is enough private information to determine completely the price of a security in the market, the equilibrium price may in fact reveal no information at all!",
                "So characterizations of when a rational expectations equilibrium is fully revealing do not immediately apply to our problem.",
                "We are not asking whether all possible functions of private information can be evaluated, but whether a particular target function can be evaluated.",
                "We show that properties of the function itself play a major role, not just the relative dimensionalities of the information and security spaces.",
                "Our second main contribution is examining the dynamics of information aggregation before equilibrium, in particular proving upper and lower bounds on the time to convergence in those cases in which aggregation succeeds.",
                "Shoham and Tennenholtz [29] define a rationally computable function as a function of agents valuations (types) that can be computed by a market, assuming agents follow rational equilibrium strategies.",

                "In designing the model, our goals were two-fold: (1) to make the model rich enough to be realistic and (2) to make the model simple enough to admit meaningful analysis.",
                "Any modeling decisions must trade off these two generally conflicting goals, and the decision process is as much an art as a science.",
                "Nonetheless, we believe that our model captures enough of the essence of real information markets to lend credence to the results that follow.",
                "In this section, we present our modeling assumptions and justifications in detail.",
                "Section 3.1 describes the initial information state of the system, Section 3.2 covers the market mechanism, and Section 3.3 presents the agents strategies. 3.1 Initial information state There are n agents (traders) in the system, each of whom is privy to one bit of information, denoted xi.",
                "The vector of all n bits is denoted x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn).",
                "In the initial state, each agent is aware only of her own bit of information.",
                "All agents have a common prior regarding the joint distribution of bits among agents, but none has any specific information about the actual value of bits held by others.",
                "Note that this common-prior assumption-typical in the economics literature-does not imply that all agents agree.",
                "To the contrary, because each agent has different information, the initial state of the system is in general a state of disagreement.",
                "Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The security being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits.",
                "The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents.",
                "We sometimes refer to the xi as the input bits.",
                "At some time in the future after trading is completed, the true value of f(x) is revealed,4 and every owner of the security is paid an amount f(x) in cash per unit owned.",
                "If an agent ends with a negative quantity of the security (by selling short), then the agent must pay the amount f(x) in cash per unit.",
                "Note that if someone were to have complete knowledge of all input bits x, then that person would know the true value f(x) of the security with certainty, and so would be willing to buy it at any price lower than f(x) and (short) sell it at any price higher than f(x).5 Following Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik [4], and Jackson and Peck [13], we model the market-price formation process as a multiperiod Shapley-Shubik market game [28].",
                "The Shapley-Shubik process operates as follows: The market proceeds in synchronous rounds.",
                "In each round, each agent i submits a bid bi and a quantity qi.",
                "The semantics are that agent i is supplying a quantity qi of the security and an amount bi of money to be traded in the market.",
                "For simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit or short sales, and so an agents trade is not constrained by her possessions.",
                "The market clears in each round by settling at a single price that balances the trade in that round: The clearing price is p = i bi/ i qi.",
                "At the end of the round, agent i holds a quantity qi proportional to the money she bid: qi = bi/p.",
                "In addition, she is left with an amount of money bi that reflects her net trade at price p: bi = bi − p(qi − qi) = pqi.",
                "Note that agent is net trade in the security is a purchase if p < bi/qi and a sale if p > bi/qi.",
                "After each round, the clearing price p is publicly revealed.",
                "Agents then revise their beliefs according to any information garnered from the new price.",
                "The next round proceeds as the previous.",
                "The process continues until an equilibrium is reached, meaning that prices and bids do not change from one round to the next.",
                "In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for each agent i.",
                "This modeling assumption serves two analytical purposes.",
                "First, it ensures that there is forced trade in every round.",
                "Classic results in economics show that perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have differing information) [20].",
                "There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy.",
                "We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the 3 Common knowledge is information that all agents know, that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad infinitum [5]. 4 The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be publicly revealed. 5 Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money. informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons).",
                "Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple function of the agents bids, p = i bi/n.",
                "We will discuss the implications of alternative market models in Section 5. 3.3 Agent strategies In order to draw formal conclusions about the price evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how agents behave.",
                "Essentially we assume that agents are riskneutral, myopic,6 and bid truthfully: Each agent in each round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which is that agents estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Expectations are computed according to each agents probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes rule when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) becomes available.",
                "We also assume that it is common knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.",
                "Would rational agents actually behave according to this strategy?",
                "Its hard to say.",
                "Certainly, we do not claim that this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.",
                "Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to effect other agents judgments in the following rounds (nonmyopic reasoning).",
                "However, we believe that the strategy outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis.",
                "Solving for a true game-theoretic equilibrium strategy in this setting seems extremely difficult.",
                "Our assumptions seem reasonable when there are enough agents in the system such that extremely complex meta-reasoning is not likely to improve upon simply bidding ones true expected value.",
                "In this case, according the the Shapley-Shubik mechanism, if the clearing price is below an agents expected value that agent will end up buying (increasing expected profit); otherwise, if the clearing price is above the agents expected value, the agent will end up selling (also increasing expected profit). 4.",
                "COMPUTATIONAL PROPERTIES In this section, we study the computational power of information markets for a very simple class of aggregation functions: Boolean functions of n variables.",
                "We characterize the set of Boolean functions that can be computed in our market model for all prior distributions and then prove upper and lower bounds on the worst-case convergence time for these markets.",
                "The information structure we assume is as follows: There are n agents, and each agent i has a single bit of private information xi.",
                "We use x to denote the vector (x1, . . . , xn) of inputs.",
                "All the agents also have a common prior probability distribution P : {0, 1}n → [0, 1] over the values of x.",

                "Note that x, and hence f(x), is completely determined by the combination of all the agents information, but it is not known to any one agent.",
                "The agents trade in a Boolean security F, which pays off $1 if f(x) = 1 and $0 if f(x) = 0.",
                "So an omniscient 6 Risk neutrality implies that each agents utility for the security is linearly related to his or her subjective estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Myopic behavior means that agents treat each round as if it were the final round: They do not reason about how their bids may affect the bids of other agents in future rounds. 158 agent with access to all the agents bits would know the true value of security F-either exactly $1 or exactly $0.",
                "In reality, risk-neutral agents with limited information will value F according to their expectation of its payoff, or Ei[f(x)], where Ei is the expectation operator applied according to agent is probability distribution.",
                "For any function f, trading in F may happen to converge to the true value of f(x) by coincidence if the prior probability distribution is sufficiently degenerate.",
                "More interestingly, we would like to know for which functions f does the price of the security F always converge to f(x) for all prior probability distributions P.7 In Section 4.2, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees convergence.",
                "In Section 4.3, we address the natural follow-up question, by deriving upper and lower bounds on the worst-case number of rounds of trading required for the value of f(x) to be revealed. 4.1 Equilibrium price characterization Our analysis builds on a characterization of the equilibrium price of F that follows from a powerful result on common knowledge of aggregates due to McKelvey and Page [19], later extended by Nielsen et al. [21].",
                "Information markets aim to aggregate the knowledge of all the agents.",
                "Procedurally, this occurs because the agents learn from the markets: The price of the security conveys information to each agent about the knowledge of other agents.",
                "We can model the flow of information through prices as follows.",
                "Let Ω = {0, 1}n be the set of possible values of x; we say that Ω denotes the set of possible states of the world.",
                "The prior P defines everyones initial belief about the likelihood of each state.",
                "As trading proceeds, some possible states can be logically ruled out, but the relative likelihoods among the remaining states are fully determined by the prior P. So the common knowledge after any stage is completely described by the set of states that an external observer-with no information beyond the sequence of prices observed-considers possible (along with the prior).",
                "Similarly, the knowledge of agent i at any point is also completely described by the set of states she considers possible.",
                "We use the notation Sr to denote the common-knowledge possibility set after round r, and Sr i to denote the set of states that agent i considers possible after round r. Initially, the only common knowledge is that the input vector x is in Ω; in other words, the set of states considered possible by an external observer before trading has occurred is the set S0 = Ω.",
                "However, each agent i also knows the value of her bit xi; thus, her knowledge set S0 i is the set {y ∈ Ω|yi = xi}.",

                "An external observer could predict agent is bid if he knew the value of xi.",
                "Thus, if he knew the value of x, he could predict the value of p1 .",
                "In other words, the external observer knows the function price1 (x) that relates the first round price to the true state x.",
                "Of course, he does not know the value of x; however, he can rule out any vector x that would have resulted in a different clearing price from the observed price p1 . 7 We assume that the common prior is consistent with x in the sense that it assigns a non-zero probability to the actual value of x.",
                "Thus, the common knowledge after round 1 is the set S1 = {y ∈ S0 | price1 (y) = p1 }.",

                "Hence, after every round r, the knowledge of agent i is given by Sr i = {y ∈ Sr |yi = xi}.",
                "Note that, because knowledge can only improve over time, we must always have Sr i ⊆ Sr−1 i and Sr ⊆ Sr−1 .",
                "Thus, only a finite number of changes in each agents knowledge are possible, and so eventually we must converge to an equilibrium after which no player learns any further information.",

                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",
                "In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs.",

                "We have developed a simplified model of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market.",
                "Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly.",
                "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security payoff function is a weighted threshold function.",
                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",
                "What is the minimum number of threshold securities required to implement a given function?",

                "Perhaps the most fragile result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar dimension-based bound will hold for other families of nonlinear clearing prices.",
                "Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information.",
                "However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information.",
                "Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.",
                "Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible.",
                "One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].",
                "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.",
                "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",

                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",

                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",

                "Section 3.1 describes the initial information state of the system, Section 3.2 covers the market mechanism, and Section 3.3 presents the agents strategies. 3.1 Initial information state There are n agents (traders) in the system, each of whom is privy to one bit of information, denoted xi.",
                "The vector of all n bits is denoted x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn).",
                "In the initial state, each agent is aware only of her own bit of information.",
                "All agents have a common prior regarding the joint distribution of bits among agents, but none has any specific information about the actual value of bits held by others.",
                "Note that this common-prior assumption-typical in the economics literature-does not imply that all agents agree.",
                "To the contrary, because each agent has different information, the initial state of the system is in general a state of disagreement.",
                "Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The security being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits.",
                "The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents.",
                "We sometimes refer to the xi as the input bits.",

                "Note that if someone were to have complete knowledge of all input bits x, then that person would know the true value f(x) of the security with certainty, and so would be willing to buy it at any price lower than f(x) and (short) sell it at any price higher than f(x).5 Following Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik [4], and Jackson and Peck [13], we model the market-price formation process as a multiperiod Shapley-Shubik market game [28].",

                "In each round, each agent i submits a bid bi and a quantity qi.",
                "The semantics are that agent i is supplying a quantity qi of the security and an amount bi of money to be traded in the market.",
                "For simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit or short sales, and so an agents trade is not constrained by her possessions.",
                "The market clears in each round by settling at a single price that balances the trade in that round: The clearing price is p = i bi/ i qi.",
                "At the end of the round, agent i holds a quantity qi proportional to the money she bid: qi = bi/p.",
                "In addition, she is left with an amount of money bi that reflects her net trade at price p: bi = bi − p(qi − qi) = pqi.",
                "Note that agent is net trade in the security is a purchase if p < bi/qi and a sale if p > bi/qi.",
                "After each round, the clearing price p is publicly revealed.",
                "Agents then revise their beliefs according to any information garnered from the new price.",
                "The next round proceeds as the previous.",
                "The process continues until an equilibrium is reached, meaning that prices and bids do not change from one round to the next.",
                "In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for each agent i.",
                "This modeling assumption serves two analytical purposes.",
                "First, it ensures that there is forced trade in every round.",
                "Classic results in economics show that perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have differing information) [20].",
                "There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy.",
                "We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the 3 Common knowledge is information that all agents know, that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad infinitum [5]. 4 The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be publicly revealed. 5 Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money. informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons).",
                "Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple function of the agents bids, p = i bi/n.",
                "We will discuss the implications of alternative market models in Section 5. 3.3 Agent strategies In order to draw formal conclusions about the price evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how agents behave.",
                "Essentially we assume that agents are riskneutral, myopic,6 and bid truthfully: Each agent in each round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which is that agents estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Expectations are computed according to each agents probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes rule when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) becomes available.",
                "We also assume that it is common knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.",
                "Would rational agents actually behave according to this strategy?",
                "Its hard to say.",
                "Certainly, we do not claim that this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.",
                "Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to effect other agents judgments in the following rounds (nonmyopic reasoning).",
                "However, we believe that the strategy outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis.",
                "Solving for a true game-theoretic equilibrium strategy in this setting seems extremely difficult.",
                "Our assumptions seem reasonable when there are enough agents in the system such that extremely complex meta-reasoning is not likely to improve upon simply bidding ones true expected value.",
                "In this case, according the the Shapley-Shubik mechanism, if the clearing price is below an agents expected value that agent will end up buying (increasing expected profit); otherwise, if the clearing price is above the agents expected value, the agent will end up selling (also increasing expected profit). 4.",
                "COMPUTATIONAL PROPERTIES In this section, we study the computational power of information markets for a very simple class of aggregation functions: Boolean functions of n variables.",

                "So an omniscient 6 Risk neutrality implies that each agents utility for the security is linearly related to his or her subjective estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Myopic behavior means that agents treat each round as if it were the final round: They do not reason about how their bids may affect the bids of other agents in future rounds. 158 agent with access to all the agents bits would know the true value of security F-either exactly $1 or exactly $0.",
                "In reality, risk-neutral agents with limited information will value F according to their expectation of its payoff, or Ei[f(x)], where Ei is the expectation operator applied according to agent is probability distribution.",
                "For any function f, trading in F may happen to converge to the true value of f(x) by coincidence if the prior probability distribution is sufficiently degenerate.",
                "More interestingly, we would like to know for which functions f does the price of the security F always converge to f(x) for all prior probability distributions P.7 In Section 4.2, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees convergence.",
                "In Section 4.3, we address the natural follow-up question, by deriving upper and lower bounds on the worst-case number of rounds of trading required for the value of f(x) to be revealed. 4.1 Equilibrium price characterization Our analysis builds on a characterization of the equilibrium price of F that follows from a powerful result on common knowledge of aggregates due to McKelvey and Page [19], later extended by Nielsen et al. [21].",
                "Information markets aim to aggregate the knowledge of all the agents.",

                "As trading proceeds, some possible states can be logically ruled out, but the relative likelihoods among the remaining states are fully determined by the prior P. So the common knowledge after any stage is completely described by the set of states that an external observer-with no information beyond the sequence of prices observed-considers possible (along with the prior).",
                "Similarly, the knowledge of agent i at any point is also completely described by the set of states she considers possible.",
                "We use the notation Sr to denote the common-knowledge possibility set after round r, and Sr i to denote the set of states that agent i considers possible after round r. Initially, the only common knowledge is that the input vector x is in Ω; in other words, the set of states considered possible by an external observer before trading has occurred is the set S0 = Ω.",
                "However, each agent i also knows the value of her bit xi; thus, her knowledge set S0 i is the set {y ∈ Ω|yi = xi}.",

                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",

                "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security payoff function is a weighted threshold function.",
                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an <br>information market</br>. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • <br>information market</br> design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",

                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",

                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",

                "Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The security being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits.",
                "The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents.",

                "Note that if someone were to have complete knowledge of all input bits x, then that person would know the true value f(x) of the security with certainty, and so would be willing to buy it at any price lower than f(x) and (short) sell it at any price higher than f(x).5 Following Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik [4], and Jackson and Peck [13], we model the market-price formation process as a multiperiod Shapley-Shubik market game [28].",

                "The semantics are that agent i is supplying a quantity qi of the security and an amount bi of money to be traded in the market.",
                "For simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit or short sales, and so an agents trade is not constrained by her possessions.",
                "The market clears in each round by settling at a single price that balances the trade in that round: The clearing price is p = i bi/ i qi.",
                "At the end of the round, agent i holds a quantity qi proportional to the money she bid: qi = bi/p.",
                "In addition, she is left with an amount of money bi that reflects her net trade at price p: bi = bi − p(qi − qi) = pqi.",

                "The next round proceeds as the previous.",
                "The process continues until an equilibrium is reached, meaning that prices and bids do not change from one round to the next.",
                "In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for each agent i.",
                "This modeling assumption serves two analytical purposes.",
                "First, it ensures that there is forced trade in every round.",
                "Classic results in economics show that perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have differing information) [20].",
                "There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy.",
                "We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the 3 Common knowledge is information that all agents know, that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad infinitum [5]. 4 The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be publicly revealed. 5 Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money. informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons).",
                "Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple function of the agents bids, p = i bi/n.",
                "We will discuss the implications of alternative market models in Section 5. 3.3 Agent strategies In order to draw formal conclusions about the price evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how agents behave.",
                "Essentially we assume that agents are riskneutral, myopic,6 and bid truthfully: Each agent in each round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which is that agents estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Expectations are computed according to each agents probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes rule when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) becomes available.",
                "We also assume that it is common knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.",
                "Would rational agents actually behave according to this strategy?",
                "Its hard to say.",
                "Certainly, we do not claim that this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.",
                "Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to effect other agents judgments in the following rounds (nonmyopic reasoning).",
                "However, we believe that the strategy outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis.",
                "Solving for a true game-theoretic equilibrium strategy in this setting seems extremely difficult.",
                "Our assumptions seem reasonable when there are enough agents in the system such that extremely complex meta-reasoning is not likely to improve upon simply bidding ones true expected value.",
                "In this case, according the the Shapley-Shubik mechanism, if the clearing price is below an agents expected value that agent will end up buying (increasing expected profit); otherwise, if the clearing price is above the agents expected value, the agent will end up selling (also increasing expected profit). 4.",

[21].",

                "As trading proceeds, some possible states can be logically ruled out, but the relative likelihoods among the remaining states are fully determined by the prior P. So the common knowledge after any stage is completely described by the set of states that an external observer-with no information beyond the sequence of prices observed-considers possible (along with the prior).",
                "Similarly, the knowledge of agent i at any point is also completely described by the set of states she considers possible.",
                "We use the notation Sr to denote the common-knowledge possibility set after round r, and Sr i to denote the set of states that agent i considers possible after round r. Initially, the only common knowledge is that the input vector x is in Ω; in other words, the set of states considered possible by an external observer before trading has occurred is the set S0 = Ω.",

                "One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].",
                "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.",
                "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",
                "In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs.",
                "The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5 also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs, where each agents private information is a real number.",

                "CONCLUSION 6.1 Summary We have framed the process of information aggregation in markets as a computation on distributed information.",
                "We have developed a simplified model of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market.",
                "Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly.",
                "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security payoff function is a weighted threshold function.",
                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the <br>market computation</br> also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",
                "What is the minimum number of threshold securities required to implement a given function?",

                "Thus, depending on the value of xi, br i will take on one of two values h (0) i or h (1) i .",
                "Note that h (0) i and h (1) i depend only on the set Sr−1 , which is common knowledge before round 161 r. Setting di = h (1) i − h (0) i , we can write br i = h (0) i + dixi.",
                "It follows that the clearing price in round r is given by pr = 1 n n i=1 (h (0) i + dixi) (4) All the agents already know all the h (0) i and di values, and they observe the price pr at the end of the rth round.",
                "Thus, they effectively have a linear equation in x1, x2, . . . , xn that they use to improve their knowledge by ruling out any possibility that would not have resulted in price pr .",
                "In other words, after r rounds, the common knowledge set Sr is the intersection of Sr−1 with the hyperplane defined by Equation (4).",
                "It follows that Sr is contained in the intersection of this hyperplane with the k-dimension linear space containing Sr−1 .",
                "If Sr is not equal to Sr−1 , this intersection defines a linear subspace of dimension (k − 1) that contains Sr , and hence Sr has dimension at most (k − 1). 2 Theorem 4.",
                "Let f be a weighted threshold function, and let P be an arbitrary prior probability distribution.",
                "Then, after at most n rounds of trading, the price reaches its equilibrium value p∞ = f(x).",

                "Then, the rth round of trading does not improve any agents knowledge, and thus we must have S∞ = Sr−1 and p∞ = pr−1 .",
                "Observing that dim(S0 ) = n, and applying Lemma 1 to the first r − 1 rounds, we must have (r − 1) ≤ n. Thus, the price reaches its equilibrium value within n rounds. 2 Theorem 4 provides an upper bound of O(n) on the number of rounds required for convergence.",
                "We now show that this bound is tight to within a factor of 2 by constructing a threshold function with 2n inputs and a prior distribution for which it takes n rounds to determine the value of f(x) in the worst case.",
                "The functions we use are the carry-bit functions.",
                "The function Cn takes 2n inputs; for convenience, we write the inputs as x1, x2 . . . , xn, y1, y2, . . . , yn or as a pair (x, y).",
                "The function value is the value of the high-order carry bit when the binary numbers xnxn−1 · · · x1 and ynyn−1 · · · y1 are added together.",

                "For this proof, let us call the agents A1, A2, . . . , An, B1, B2, . . . , Bn, where Ai holds input bit xi, and Bi holds input bit yi.",
                "We first illustrate our technique by proving that computing C2 requires 2 rounds in the worst case.",
                "To do this, we construct a common prior P2 as follows: • The pair (x1, y1) takes on the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) uniformly (i.e., with probability 1 4 each). • We extend this to a distribution on (x1, x2, y1, y2) by specifying the conditional distribution of (x2, y2) given (x1, y1): If (x1, y1) = (1, 1), then (x2, y2) takes the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) with probabilities 1 2 , 1 6 , 1 6 , 1 6 respectively.",

                "Note that the function and distribution are symmetric between x and y, and so the same argument shows that B1 will also bid 0.5 in the first round.",
                "Thus, the price p1 announced at the end of the first round reveals no information about x1 or y1.",
                "The reason this occurs is that, under this distribution, the second carry bit C2 is statistically independent of the first carry bit (x1 ∧ y1); we will use this trick again in the general construction.",
                "Now, suppose that (x2, y2) is either (0, 1) or (1, 0).",
                "Then, even if x2 and y2 are completely revealed by the first-round price, the value of C2(x1, x2, y1, y2) is not revealed: It will be 1 if x1 = y1 = 1 and 0 otherwise.",

                "Claim: Under distribution Pn, for all i < n, P(Cn(x, y) = 1|xi = 1) = P(Cn(x, y) = 1|xi = 0). 162 Proof of claim: A similar calculation to that used for C2 above shows that the value of Cn(x, y) under this distribution is statistically independent of Cn−1(x−n , y−n ).",
                "For i < n, xi can affect the value of Cn only through Cn−1.",
                "Also, by contruction of Pn, given the value of Cn−1, the distribution of Cn is independent of xi.",
                "It follows that Cn(x, y) is statistically independent of xi as well.",
                "Of course, a similar result holds for yi by symmetry.",
                "Thus, in the first round, for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, the bids of agents Ai and Bi do not reveal anything about their private information.",
                "Thus, the first-round price does not reveal any information about the value of (x−n , y−n ).",
                "On the other hand, agents An and Bn do have different expectations of Cn(x) depending on whether their input bit is a 0 or a 1; thus, the first-round price does reveal whether neither, one, or both of xn and yn are 1.",
                "Now, consider a situation in which (xn, yn) takes on the value (1, 0) or (0, 1).",
                "We show that, in this case, after one round we are left with the residual problem of computing the value of Cn−1(x−n , y−n ) under the prior Pn−1.",
                "Clearly, when xn + yn = 1, Cn(x, y) = Cn−1(x−n , y−n ).",
                "Further, according to the construction of Pn, the event (xn+ yn = 1) has the same probability (1/3) for all values of (x−n , y−n ).",
                "Thus, conditioning on this fact does not alter the probability distribution over (x−n , y−n ); it must still be Pn−1.",
                "Finally, the inductive assumption tells us that solving this residual problem will take at least n − 1 more rounds in the worst case and hence that finding the value of Cn(x, y) takes at least n rounds in the worst case. 2 5.",

                "While it seems reasonable that the market price satisfies monotonicity properties, the exact form of the aggregate function may not be known if the volume of each users trades is not observable; this depends on the details of the market process.",
                "Theorem 3 and Theorem 5 hold more generally; they only require that an agents strategy depends only on her conditional expectation of the securitys value.",
                "Perhaps the most fragile result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar dimension-based bound will hold for other families of nonlinear clearing prices.",
                "Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information.",
                "However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information.",
                "Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.",
                "Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible.",
                "One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].",
                "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.",
                "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",
                "In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs.",
                "The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5 also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs, where each agents private information is a real number.",
                "Further, Theorem 2 also holds provided the market reaches equilibrium.",
                "With real inputs and arbitrary prior distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 6.",

                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",

                "Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The security being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits.",
                "The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents.",

                "The process continues until an equilibrium is reached, meaning that prices and bids do not change from one round to the next.",
                "In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for each agent i.",
                "This modeling assumption serves two analytical purposes.",
                "First, it ensures that there is forced trade in every round.",
                "Classic results in economics show that perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have differing information) [20].",
                "There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy.",
                "We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the 3 Common knowledge is information that all agents know, that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad infinitum [5]. 4 The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be publicly revealed. 5 Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money. informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons).",
                "Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple function of the agents bids, p = i bi/n.",
                "We will discuss the implications of alternative market models in Section 5. 3.3 Agent strategies In order to draw formal conclusions about the price evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how agents behave.",
                "Essentially we assume that agents are riskneutral, myopic,6 and bid truthfully: Each agent in each round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which is that agents estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Expectations are computed according to each agents probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes rule when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) becomes available.",
                "We also assume that it is common knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.",
                "Would rational agents actually behave according to this strategy?",
                "Its hard to say.",
                "Certainly, we do not claim that this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.",
                "Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to effect other agents judgments in the following rounds (nonmyopic reasoning).",
                "However, we believe that the strategy outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis.",
                "Solving for a true game-theoretic equilibrium strategy in this setting seems extremely difficult.",
                "Our assumptions seem reasonable when there are enough agents in the system such that extremely complex meta-reasoning is not likely to improve upon simply bidding ones true expected value.",

                "So an omniscient 6 Risk neutrality implies that each agents utility for the security is linearly related to his or her subjective estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Myopic behavior means that agents treat each round as if it were the final round: They do not reason about how their bids may affect the bids of other agents in future rounds. 158 agent with access to all the agents bits would know the true value of security F-either exactly $1 or exactly $0.",
                "In reality, risk-neutral agents with limited information will value F according to their expectation of its payoff, or Ei[f(x)], where Ei is the expectation operator applied according to agent is probability distribution.",

                "In Section 4.3, we address the natural follow-up question, by deriving upper and lower bounds on the worst-case number of rounds of trading required for the value of f(x) to be revealed. 4.1 Equilibrium price characterization Our analysis builds on a characterization of the equilibrium price of F that follows from a powerful result on common knowledge of aggregates due to McKelvey and Page [19], later extended by Nielsen et al. [21].",
                "Information markets aim to aggregate the knowledge of all the agents.",

                "The prior P defines everyones initial belief about the likelihood of each state.",
                "As trading proceeds, some possible states can be logically ruled out, but the relative likelihoods among the remaining states are fully determined by the prior P. So the common knowledge after any stage is completely described by the set of states that an external observer-with no information beyond the sequence of prices observed-considers possible (along with the prior).",
                "Similarly, the knowledge of agent i at any point is also completely described by the set of states she considers possible.",
                "We use the notation Sr to denote the common-knowledge possibility set after round r, and Sr i to denote the set of states that agent i considers possible after round r. Initially, the only common knowledge is that the input vector x is in Ω; in other words, the set of states considered possible by an external observer before trading has occurred is the set S0 = Ω.",
                "However, each agent i also knows the value of her bit xi; thus, her knowledge set S0 i is the set {y ∈ Ω|yi = xi}.",

                "With real inputs and arbitrary prior distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION 6.1 Summary We have framed the process of information aggregation in markets as a computation on distributed information.",
                "We have developed a simplified model of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market.",
                "Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly.",
                "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security payoff function is a weighted threshold function.",
                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",
                "What is the minimum number of threshold securities required to implement a given function?",

                "Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The security being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits.",
                "The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents.",

                "Then, the rth round of trading does not improve any agents knowledge, and thus we must have S∞ = Sr−1 and p∞ = pr−1 .",

                "We now show that this bound is tight to within a factor of 2 by constructing a threshold function with 2n inputs and a prior distribution for which it takes n rounds to determine the value of f(x) in the worst case.",

                "To do this, we construct a common prior P2 as follows: • The pair (x1, y1) takes on the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) uniformly (i.e., with probability 1 4 each). • We extend this to a distribution on (x1, x2, y1, y2) by specifying the conditional distribution of (x2, y2) given (x1, y1): If (x1, y1) = (1, 1), then (x2, y2) takes the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) with probabilities 1 2 , 1 6 , 1 6 , 1 6 respectively.",

                "Note that the function and distribution are symmetric between x and y, and so the same argument shows that B1 will also bid 0.5 in the first round.",
                "Thus, the price p1 announced at the end of the first round reveals no information about x1 or y1.",
                "The reason this occurs is that, under this distribution, the second carry bit C2 is statistically independent of the first carry bit (x1 ∧ y1); we will use this trick again in the general construction.",

                "Then, even if x2 and y2 are completely revealed by the first-round price, the value of C2(x1, x2, y1, y2) is not revealed: It will be 1 if x1 = y1 = 1 and 0 otherwise.",

                "Claim: Under distribution Pn, for all i < n, P(Cn(x, y) = 1|xi = 1) = P(Cn(x, y) = 1|xi = 0). 162 Proof of claim: A similar calculation to that used for C2 above shows that the value of Cn(x, y) under this distribution is statistically independent of Cn−1(x−n , y−n ).",
                "For i < n, xi can affect the value of Cn only through Cn−1.",
                "Also, by contruction of Pn, given the value of Cn−1, the distribution of Cn is independent of xi.",
                "It follows that Cn(x, y) is statistically independent of xi as well.",
                "Of course, a similar result holds for yi by symmetry.",
                "Thus, in the first round, for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, the bids of agents Ai and Bi do not reveal anything about their private information.",
                "Thus, the first-round price does not reveal any information about the value of (x−n , y−n ).",
                "On the other hand, agents An and Bn do have different expectations of Cn(x) depending on whether their input bit is a 0 or a 1; thus, the first-round price does reveal whether neither, one, or both of xn and yn are 1.",
                "Now, consider a situation in which (xn, yn) takes on the value (1, 0) or (0, 1).",
                "We show that, in this case, after one round we are left with the residual problem of computing the value of Cn−1(x−n , y−n ) under the prior Pn−1.",
                "Clearly, when xn + yn = 1, Cn(x, y) = Cn−1(x−n , y−n ).",
                "Further, according to the construction of Pn, the event (xn+ yn = 1) has the same probability (1/3) for all values of (x−n , y−n ).",
                "Thus, conditioning on this fact does not alter the probability distribution over (x−n , y−n ); it must still be Pn−1.",
                "Finally, the inductive assumption tells us that solving this residual problem will take at least n − 1 more rounds in the worst case and hence that finding the value of Cn(x, y) takes at least n rounds in the worst case. 2 5.",

                "Assuming that agents bid truthfully, Theorem 2 holds in any model in which the price is a known stochastically monotone aggregate of agents bids.",
                "While it seems reasonable that the market price satisfies monotonicity properties, the exact form of the aggregate function may not be known if the volume of each users trades is not observable; this depends on the details of the market process.",
                "Theorem 3 and Theorem 5 hold more generally; they only require that an agents strategy depends only on her conditional expectation of the securitys value.",
                "Perhaps the most fragile result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar dimension-based bound will hold for other families of nonlinear clearing prices.",
                "Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information.",
                "However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information.",
                "Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.",
                "Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible.",
                "One example is a market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].",
                "These markets have the property that a riskneutral agents best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.",
                "Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and publicly known.",
                "If the market structure is such that, for example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agents trade, then in equilibrium there is common knowledge of all agents expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.",
                "Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.",
                "This suggests that the problem of eliciting truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].",
                "In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs.",
                "The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5 also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs, where each agents private information is a real number.",
                "Further, Theorem 2 also holds provided the market reaches equilibrium.",
                "With real inputs and arbitrary prior distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION 6.1 Summary We have framed the process of information aggregation in markets as a computation on distributed information.",
                "We have developed a simplified model of an information market that we believe captures many of the important aspects of real agent interaction in an information market.",
                "Within this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely what the market can compute and how quickly.",
                "Specifically, we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the security payoff function is a weighted threshold function.",
                "We prove that the process whereby agents reveal their information over time and learn from the resulting announced prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct full-information price in the worst case.",
                "We show that this bound is tight within a factor of two. 6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.",
                "Some interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: • The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.",
                "Further, we have neglected influences on the market price other than from rational traders; the market price may also be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or irrational traders.",
                "It is interesting to ask what aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy prices. • Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the value of the function and a small number of input bits are switched, can the new value of the function be computed incrementally and quickly? • Distributed computation: In our model, distributed information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.",
                "In a sense, some of the computation itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?",
                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",

                "We develop a simplified model of an information market, along with trading strategies, in order to formalize the computational properties of the process.",
                "We show that securities whose payoffs cannot be expressed as weighted threshold functions of distributed input bits are not guaranteed to converge to the proper equilibrium predicted by economic theory.",
                "On the other hand, securities whose payoffs are threshold functions are guaranteed to converge, for all prior probability distributions.",
                "Moreover, these threshold securities converge in at most n rounds, where n is the number of bits of distributed information.",
                "We also prove a lower bound, showing a type of threshold security that requires at least n/2 rounds to converge in the worst case.",

                "INTRODUCTION The strong form of the <br>efficient markets hypothesis</br> states that market prices nearly instantly incorporate all information available to all traders.",
                "As a result, market prices encode the best forecasts of future outcomes given all information, even if that information is distributed across many sources.",
                "Supporting evidence can be found in empirical studies of options markets [14], political stock markets [7, 8, 22], sports betting markets [3, 9, 27], horse-racing markets [30], market games [23, 24], and laboratory investigations of experimental markets [6, 25, 26].",
                "The process of information incorporation is, at its essence, a distributed computation.",
                "Each trader begins with his or her own information.",
                "As trades are made, summary information is revealed through market prices.",
                "Traders learn or infer what information others are likely to have by observing prices, then update their own beliefs based on their observations.",
                "Over time, if the process works as advertised, all information is revealed, and all traders converge to the same information state.",
                "At this point, the market is in what is called a rational expectations equilibrium [11, 16, 19].",
                "All information available to all traders is now reflected in the going prices, and no further trades are desirable until some new information becomes available.",
                "While most markets are not designed with information aggregation as a primary motivation-for example, derivatives 156 markets are intended mainly for risk management and sports betting markets for entertainment-recently, some markets have been created solely for the purpose of aggregating information on a topic of interest.",
                "The Iowa Electronic Market1 is a prime example, operated by the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business for the purpose of investigating how information about political elections distributed among traders gets reflected in securities prices whose payoffs are tied to actual election outcomes [7, 8].",
                "In this paper, we investigate the nature of the computational process whereby distributed information is revealed and combined over time into the prices in information markets.",
                "To do so, in Section 3, we propose a model of an information market that is tractable for theoretical analysis and, we believe, captures much of the important essence of real information markets.",
                "In Section 4, we present our main theoretical results concerning this model.",
                "We prove that only Boolean securities whose payoffs can be expressed as threshold functions of the distributed input bits of information are guaranteed to converge as predicted by rational expectations theory.",
                "Boolean securities with more complex payoffs may not converge under some prior distributions.",
                "We also provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence time for these threshold securities.",
                "We show that, for all prior distributions, the price of a threshold security converges to its rational expectations equilibrium price in at most n rounds, where n is the number of bits of distributed information.",
                "We show that this worst-case bound is tight within a factor of two by illustrating a situation in which a threshold security requires n/2 rounds to converge. 2.",
                "RELATIONSHIP TO RELATED WORK As mentioned, there is a great deal of documented evidence supporting the notion that markets are able to aggregate information in a number of scenarios using a variety of market mechanisms.",
                "The theoretically ideal mechanism requires what is called a complete market.",
                "A complete market contains enough linearly independent securities to span the entire state space of interest [1, 31].",
                "That is, the dimensionality of the available securities equals the dimensionality of the event space over which information is to be aggregated.2 In this ideal case, all private information becomes common knowledge in equilibrium, and thus any function of the private information can be directly evaluated by any agent or observer.",
                "However, this theoretical ideal is almost never achievable in practice, because it generally requires a number of securities exponential in the number of random variables of interest.",
                "When available securities form an incomplete market [17] in relation to the desired information space-as is usually the case-aggregation may be partial.",
                "Not all private information is revealed in equilibrium, and prices may not convey enough information to recover the complete joint probability distribution over all events.",
                "Still, it is generally assumed that aggregation does occur along the dimensions represented in the market; that is, prices do reflect a consistent projection of the entire joint distribution onto the smaller-dimensional space spanned by securities.",
                "In this pa1 http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/ 2 When we refer to independence or dimensionality of securities, we mean the independence or dimensionality of the random variables on which the security payoffs are based. per, we investigate cases in which even this partial aggregation fails.",
                "For example, even though there is enough private information to determine completely the price of a security in the market, the equilibrium price may in fact reveal no information at all!",
                "So characterizations of when a rational expectations equilibrium is fully revealing do not immediately apply to our problem.",
                "We are not asking whether all possible functions of private information can be evaluated, but whether a particular target function can be evaluated.",
                "We show that properties of the function itself play a major role, not just the relative dimensionalities of the information and security spaces.",
                "Our second main contribution is examining the dynamics of information aggregation before equilibrium, in particular proving upper and lower bounds on the time to convergence in those cases in which aggregation succeeds.",
                "Shoham and Tennenholtz [29] define a rationally computable function as a function of agents valuations (types) that can be computed by a market, assuming agents follow rational equilibrium strategies.",
                "The authors mainly consider auctions of goods as their basic mechanistic unit and examine the communication complexity involved in computing various functions of agents valuations of goods.",
                "For example, they give auction mechanisms that can compute the maximum, minimum, and kth-highest of the agents valuations of a single good using 1, 1, and n − k + 1 bits of communication, respectively.",
                "They also examine the potential tradeoff between communication complexity and revenue. 3.",
                "MODEL OF AN INFORMATION MARKET To investigate the properties and limitations of the process whereby an information market converges toward its rational-expectations equilibrium, we formulate a representative model of the market.",
                "In designing the model, our goals were two-fold: (1) to make the model rich enough to be realistic and (2) to make the model simple enough to admit meaningful analysis.",
                "Any modeling decisions must trade off these two generally conflicting goals, and the decision process is as much an art as a science.",
                "Nonetheless, we believe that our model captures enough of the essence of real information markets to lend credence to the results that follow.",
                "In this section, we present our modeling assumptions and justifications in detail.",
                "Section 3.1 describes the initial information state of the system, Section 3.2 covers the market mechanism, and Section 3.3 presents the agents strategies. 3.1 Initial information state There are n agents (traders) in the system, each of whom is privy to one bit of information, denoted xi.",
                "The vector of all n bits is denoted x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn).",
                "In the initial state, each agent is aware only of her own bit of information.",
                "All agents have a common prior regarding the joint distribution of bits among agents, but none has any specific information about the actual value of bits held by others.",
                "Note that this common-prior assumption-typical in the economics literature-does not imply that all agents agree.",
                "To the contrary, because each agent has different information, the initial state of the system is in general a state of disagreement.",
                "Nearly any disagreement that could be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be mod157 eled by assuming a common prior with different information, and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it may seem. 3.2 Market mechanism The security being traded by the agents is a financial instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents bits.",
                "The form of f (the description of the security) is common knowledge3 among agents.",
                "We sometimes refer to the xi as the input bits.",
                "At some time in the future after trading is completed, the true value of f(x) is revealed,4 and every owner of the security is paid an amount f(x) in cash per unit owned.",
                "If an agent ends with a negative quantity of the security (by selling short), then the agent must pay the amount f(x) in cash per unit.",
                "Note that if someone were to have complete knowledge of all input bits x, then that person would know the true value f(x) of the security with certainty, and so would be willing to buy it at any price lower than f(x) and (short) sell it at any price higher than f(x).5 Following Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik [4], and Jackson and Peck [13], we model the market-price formation process as a multiperiod Shapley-Shubik market game [28].",
                "The Shapley-Shubik process operates as follows: The market proceeds in synchronous rounds.",
                "In each round, each agent i submits a bid bi and a quantity qi.",
                "The semantics are that agent i is supplying a quantity qi of the security and an amount bi of money to be traded in the market.",
                "For simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit or short sales, and so an agents trade is not constrained by her possessions.",
                "The market clears in each round by settling at a single price that balances the trade in that round: The clearing price is p = i bi/ i qi.",
                "At the end of the round, agent i holds a quantity qi proportional to the money she bid: qi = bi/p.",
                "In addition, she is left with an amount of money bi that reflects her net trade at price p: bi = bi − p(qi − qi) = pqi.",
                "Note that agent is net trade in the security is a purchase if p < bi/qi and a sale if p > bi/qi.",
                "After each round, the clearing price p is publicly revealed.",
                "Agents then revise their beliefs according to any information garnered from the new price.",
                "The next round proceeds as the previous.",
                "The process continues until an equilibrium is reached, meaning that prices and bids do not change from one round to the next.",
                "In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for each agent i.",
                "This modeling assumption serves two analytical purposes.",
                "First, it ensures that there is forced trade in every round.",
                "Classic results in economics show that perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have differing information) [20].",
                "There are many factors that can induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a market maker who is pumping money into the market through a subsidy.",
                "We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the 3 Common knowledge is information that all agents know, that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad infinitum [5]. 4 The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be publicly revealed. 5 Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money. informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons).",
                "Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple function of the agents bids, p = i bi/n.",
                "We will discuss the implications of alternative market models in Section 5. 3.3 Agent strategies In order to draw formal conclusions about the price evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how agents behave.",
                "Essentially we assume that agents are riskneutral, myopic,6 and bid truthfully: Each agent in each round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which is that agents estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Expectations are computed according to each agents probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes rule when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) becomes available.",
                "We also assume that it is common knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.",
                "Would rational agents actually behave according to this strategy?",
                "Its hard to say.",
                "Certainly, we do not claim that this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.",
                "Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to effect other agents judgments in the following rounds (nonmyopic reasoning).",
                "However, we believe that the strategy outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis.",
                "Solving for a true game-theoretic equilibrium strategy in this setting seems extremely difficult.",
                "Our assumptions seem reasonable when there are enough agents in the system such that extremely complex meta-reasoning is not likely to improve upon simply bidding ones true expected value.",
                "In this case, according the the Shapley-Shubik mechanism, if the clearing price is below an agents expected value that agent will end up buying (increasing expected profit); otherwise, if the clearing price is above the agents expected value, the agent will end up selling (also increasing expected profit). 4.",
                "COMPUTATIONAL PROPERTIES In this section, we study the computational power of information markets for a very simple class of aggregation functions: Boolean functions of n variables.",
                "We characterize the set of Boolean functions that can be computed in our market model for all prior distributions and then prove upper and lower bounds on the worst-case convergence time for these markets.",
                "The information structure we assume is as follows: There are n agents, and each agent i has a single bit of private information xi.",
                "We use x to denote the vector (x1, . . . , xn) of inputs.",
                "All the agents also have a common prior probability distribution P : {0, 1}n → [0, 1] over the values of x.",
                "We define a Boolean aggregate function f(x) : {0, 1}n → {0, 1} that we would like the market to compute.",
                "Note that x, and hence f(x), is completely determined by the combination of all the agents information, but it is not known to any one agent.",
                "The agents trade in a Boolean security F, which pays off $1 if f(x) = 1 and $0 if f(x) = 0.",
                "So an omniscient 6 Risk neutrality implies that each agents utility for the security is linearly related to his or her subjective estimation of the expected payoff of the security.",
                "Myopic behavior means that agents treat each round as if it were the final round: They do not reason about how their bids may affect the bids of other agents in future rounds. 158 agent with access to all the agents bits would know the true value of security F-either exactly $1 or exactly $0.",
                "In reality, risk-neutral agents with limited information will value F according to their expectation of its payoff, or Ei[f(x)], where Ei is the expectation operator applied according to agent is probability distribution.",
                "For any function f, trading in F may happen to converge to the true value of f(x) by coincidence if the prior probability distribution is sufficiently degenerate.",
                "More interestingly, we would like to know for which functions f does the price of the security F always converge to f(x) for all prior probability distributions P.7 In Section 4.2, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees convergence.",
                "In Section 4.3, we address the natural follow-up question, by deriving upper and lower bounds on the worst-case number of rounds of trading required for the value of f(x) to be revealed. 4.1 Equilibrium price characterization Our analysis builds on a characterization of the equilibrium price of F that follows from a powerful result on common knowledge of aggregates due to McKelvey and Page [19], later extended by Nielsen et al. [21].",
                "Information markets aim to aggregate the knowledge of all the agents.",
                "Procedurally, this occurs because the agents learn from the markets: The price of the security conveys information to each agent about the knowledge of other agents.",
                "We can model the flow of information through prices as follows.",
                "Let Ω = {0, 1}n be the set of possible values of x; we say that Ω denotes the set of possible states of the world.",
                "The prior P defines everyones initial belief about the likelihood of each state.",
                "As trading proceeds, some possible states can be logically ruled out, but the relative likelihoods among the remaining states are fully determined by the prior P. So the common knowledge after any stage is completely described by the set of states that an external observer-with no information beyond the sequence of prices observed-considers possible (along with the prior).",
                "Similarly, the knowledge of agent i at any point is also completely described by the set of states she considers possible.",
                "We use the notation Sr to denote the common-knowledge possibility set after round r, and Sr i to denote the set of states that agent i considers possible after round r. Initially, the only common knowledge is that the input vector x is in Ω; in other words, the set of states considered possible by an external observer before trading has occurred is the set S0 = Ω.",
                "However, each agent i also knows the value of her bit xi; thus, her knowledge set S0 i is the set {y ∈ Ω|yi = xi}.",
                "Agent is first-round bid is her conditional expectation of the event f(x) = 1 given that x ∈ S0 i .",
                "All the agents bids are processed, and the clearing price p1 is announced.",
                "An external observer could predict agent is bid if he knew the value of xi.",
                "Thus, if he knew the value of x, he could predict the value of p1 .",
                "In other words, the external observer knows the function price1 (x) that relates the first round price to the true state x.",
                "Of course, he does not know the value of x; however, he can rule out any vector x that would have resulted in a different clearing price from the observed price p1 . 7 We assume that the common prior is consistent with x in the sense that it assigns a non-zero probability to the actual value of x.",
                "Thus, the common knowledge after round 1 is the set S1 = {y ∈ S0 | price1 (y) = p1 }.",
                "Agent i knows the common knowledge and, in addition, knows the value of bit xi.",
                "Hence, after every round r, the knowledge of agent i is given by Sr i = {y ∈ Sr |yi = xi}.",
                "Note that, because knowledge can only improve over time, we must always have Sr i ⊆ Sr−1 i and Sr ⊆ Sr−1 .",
                "Thus, only a finite number of changes in each agents knowledge are possible, and so eventually we must converge to an equilibrium after which no player learns any further information.",
                "We use S∞ to denote the common knowledge at this point, and S∞ i to denote agent is knowledge at this point.",
                "Let p∞ denote the clearing price at equilibrium.",
                "Informally, McKelvey and Page [19] show that, if n people with common priors but different information about the likelihood of some event A agree about a suitable aggregate of their individual conditional probabilities, then their individual conditional probabilities of event As occurring must be identical. (The precise definition of suitable is described below.)",
                "There is a strong connection to rational expectation equilibria in markets, which was noted in the original McKelvey-Page paper: The market price of a security is common knowledge at the point of equilibrium.",
                "Thus, if the price is a suitable aggregate of the conditional expectations of all the agents, then in equilibrium they must have identical conditional expectations of the event that the security will pay off. (Note that their information may still be different.)",

                "If g is a stochastically regular function and g(p∞ 1 , p∞ 2 , . . . , p∞ n ) is common knowledge, then it must be the case that p∞ 1 = p∞ 2 = · · · = p∞ n = E(F|x ∈ S∞ ) = p∞ In one round of our simplified Shapley-Shubik trading model, the announced price is the mean of the conditional expectations of the n agents.",
                "The mean is a stochastically regular function; hence, Theorem 1 shows that, at equilibrium, all agents have identical conditional expectations of the payoff of the security.",

                "In our context, this is achieved by announcing the current price at the end of each round; this will ultimately converge to a state in which all agents bid the same price p∞ .",
                "However, reaching an equilibrium price is not sufficient for the purposes of information aggregation.",
                "We also want the price to reveal the actual value of f(x).",
                "It is possible that the equilibrium price p∞ of the security F will not be either 0 or 1, and so we cannot infer the value of f(x) from it.",

                "Suppose the prior probability distribution is uniform, i.e., x = (x1, x2) takes the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1) each with probability 1 4 .",

                "For example, can we find a good distributed-computational model of a decentralized market? • Agents computation: We have not accounted for the complexity of the computations that agents must do to accurately update their beliefs after each round. • Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid truthfully.",
                "A more satisfying approach would be to assume only rationality and solve for the resulting gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current computational model or another model of an information market. • The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents priors are only approximately the same or when they differ greatly? • Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems 3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus involve very specific prior probability distributions.",
                "It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions. • Information market design: Non-threshold functions can be implemented by layering two or more threshold functions together.",
                "What is the minimum number of threshold securities required to implement a given function?",
