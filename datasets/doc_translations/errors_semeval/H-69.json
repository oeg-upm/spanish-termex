In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a vertical search engine. More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation. We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible. The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums. Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described. Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.

INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries. As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want. There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g. Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g. Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3]. We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow. Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors. This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities. Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked. For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data. Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences). This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities. However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains. High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions. For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers. Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships. This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos. Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums. Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search. Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively. We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships. Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12]. We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods. We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation. In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images. However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24]. This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search. On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content. To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine. The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories. Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds. However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem. Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality. For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity. However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image. Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future. Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos. Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine. In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos. In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers. These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results. More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos. The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem. Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums. In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums. Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum. However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine. To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums. That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums. We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization. The main contributions of this paper are: 1. We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2. We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research. In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm. Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4. It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2. ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom. The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object. For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales. It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem. The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums. That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums. Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation. Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums. This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity. In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos. The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations. Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed. Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work). Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums. Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space. This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences. By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem. For convenience, the following notations are employed. Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively. The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores. Suppose there are a total of K Web sites. We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites. In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites. The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration. Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum. The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be. In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one. But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results. Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea. The Web Community 1 is the reference community. The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same. The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models. So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines. We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work. Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large. In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums. Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5. Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods. In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings. This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums. It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval. We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score. The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed. Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity. The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums. The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores. The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers. To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method. Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score. And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score. This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent. The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums. Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum. We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community. Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters. This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski. Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki. For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune. Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical. It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums. This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code). Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n). The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids. Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built. The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system. Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise. Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space. Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids. The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs. Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum. More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3. Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method. It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments. Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged. As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged. This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results. Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints. First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0. This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1. Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method. We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment. Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one. Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile). This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one. However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively. The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion. Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links. After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums? Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent? We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect. On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent. Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1. Here, we discuss some other related works. The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists. However, there are fundamental differences between them. First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall. Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1). In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query. Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases. Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12]. All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model. In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank. Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3. EXPERIMENTS In this section, we carry out our research on high-quality photo search. We first briefly introduce the newly proposed vertical image search engine - EnjoyPhoto in section 3.1. Then we focus on how to rank photos from different Web forums. In order to do so, we first normalize the scores (ratings) for photos from different multiple Web forums in section 3.2. Then we try to find duplicate photos in section 3.3. Some intermediate results are discussed using δ measure in section 3.4. Finally a set of user studies is carried out carefully to justify our proposed method in section 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: high-quality Photo Search Engine In order to meet user requirement of enjoying high-quality photos, we propose and build a high-quality photo search engine - EnjoyPhoto, which accounts for the following three key issues: 1. how to crawl and index photos, 2. how to determine the qualities of each photo and 3. how to display the search results in order to make the search process enjoyable. For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3). As for Issue 3, we devise the interface of the system deliberately in order to smooth the users process of enjoying high-quality photos. Techniques, such as Fisheye and slides show, are utilized in current system. Figure 5 shows the interface. We will not talk more about this issue as it is not an emphasis of this paper. Figure 5: EnjoyPhoto: an enjoyable high-quality photo search engine, where 26,477 records are returned for the query fall in about 0.421 seconds As for Issue 1, we extracted from a commercial search engine a subset of photos coming from various photo forums all over the world, and explicitly parsed the Web pages containing these photos. The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million. After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings. All these metadata are generally precise descriptions or annotations for the image content, which are then indexed by general text-based search technologies [9, 18, 11]. In current system, the ranking function was specifically tuned to emphasize title, categorization, and rating information. Issue 2 is essentially dealt with in the following sections which derive the quality of photos by analyzing ratings provided by various Web photo forums. Here we chose six photo forums to study the ranking problem and denote them as Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E and Web-F. 3.2 Photo Score Normalization Detailed analysis of different score normalization methods are analyzed in this section. In this analysis, the zero 1 Digital cameras save JPEG (.jpg) files with EXIF (Exchangeable Image File) data. Camera settings and scene information are recorded by the camera into the image file. www.digicamhelp.com/what-is-exif/ 382 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Normalized Score TotalNumber (a) Web-A 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (b) Web-B 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 5 Normalized Score TotalNumber (c) Web-C 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (d) Web-D 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 Normalized Score TotalNumber (e) Web-E 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (f) Web-F Figure 6: Distributions of mean scores normalized to [0, 10] scores that usually occupy about than 30% of the total number of photos for some Web forums are not currently taken into account. How to utilize these photos is left for future explorations. In Figure 6, we list the distributions of the mean score, which is transformed to a fixed interval [0, 10]. The distributions of the average scores of these Web forums look quite different. Distributions in Figure 6(a), 6(b), and 6(e) looks like Gaussian distributions, while those in Figure 6(d) and 6(f) are dominated by the top score. The reason of these eccentric distributions for Web-D and Web-F lies in their coarse rating systems. In fact, Web-D and Web-F use 2 or 3 point rating scales whereas other Web forums use 7 or 14 point rating scales. Therefore, it will be problematic if we directly use these averaged scores. Furthermore the average score is very likely to be spammed, if there are only a few users rating a photo. Figure 7 shows the total score normalization method by maximal and minimal scores, which is one of our base line system. All the total scores of a given Web forum are normalized to [0, 100] according to the maximal score and minimal score of corresponding Web forum. We notice that total score distribution of Web-A in Figure 7(a) has two larger tails than all the others. To show the shape of the distributions more clearly, we only show the distributions on [0, 25] in Figure 7(b),7(c),7(d),7(e), and 7(f). Figure 8 shows the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method, where the modes of the six distributions are normalized to 5 and the 90% percentile to 8. We can see that this normalization method makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent. The two proposed algorithms are all based on these normalization methods. 3.3 Duplicate photo detection Targeting at computational efficiency, the Dedup algorithm may lose some recall rate, but can achieve a high precision rate. We also focus on finding precise hidden links rather than all hidden links. Figure 9 shows some duplicate detection examples. The results are shown in Table 1 and verify that large numbers of duplicate photos exist in any two Web forums even with the strict condition for Dedup where we chose first 29 bits as the hash code. Since there are only a few parameters to estimate in the proposed fusion methods, the numbers of duplicate photos shown Table 1 are 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Normalized Score TotalNumber (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 5 Normalized Score TotalNumber (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Normalized Score TotalNumber (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (f) Web-F Figure 7: Maxmin Normalization 0 5 10 15 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Normalized Score TotalNumber (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Normalized Score TotalNumber (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Normalized Score TotalNumber (f) Web-F Figure 8: Mode-90% Percentile Normalization sufficient to determine these parameters. The last table column lists the total number of photos in the corresponding Web forums. 3.4 δ Measure The parameters of the proposed linear and nonlinear algorithms are calculated using the duplicate data shown in Table 1, where the Web-C is chosen as the reference Web forum since it shares the most duplicate photos with other forums. Table 2 and 3 show the δ measure on the linear model and nonlinear model. As δkl is symmetric and δkk = 0, we only show the upper triangular part. The NaN values in both tables lie in that no duplicate photos have been detected by the Dedup algorithm as reported in Table 1. The linear model guarantees that the δ measures related Table 1: Number of duplicate photos between each pair of Web forums A B C D E F Scale A 0 316 1,386 178 302 0 130k B 316 0 14,708 909 8,023 348 675k C 1,386 14,708 0 1,508 19,271 1,083 1,003k D 178 909 1,508 0 1,084 21 155k E 302 8,023 19,271 1,084 0 98 448k F 0 348 1,083 21 98 0 122k 383 Figure 9: Some results of duplicate photo detection Table 2: δ measure on the linear model.

It is indeed the case (see the underlined numbers in Table 2). But this model can not guarantee that the δ measures on the non-reference communities can also be no less than 0, as the normalization steps are based on duplicate photos between the reference community and a nonreference community. Results shows that all the numbers in the δ measure are greater than 0 (see all the non-underlined numbers in Table 2), which indicates that it is probable that this model will give optimal results. On the contrary, the nonlinear model does not guarantee that δ measures related to the reference community should be no less than 0, as not all duplicate photos between the two Web forums can be used when optimizing this model. In fact, the duplicate photos that lie in different intervals will not be used in this model. It is these specific duplicate photos that make the δ measure negative. As a result, there are both negative and positive items in Table 3, but overall the number of positive ones are greater than negative ones (9:5), that indicates the model may be better than the normalization only method (see next subsection) which has an all-zero δ measure, and worse than the linear model. 3.5 User Study Because it is hard to find an objective criterion to evaluate Table 3: δ measure on the nonlinear model.

Ten subjects were invited to participate in the user study. They were recruited from nearby universities. As search engines of both text search and image search are familiar to university students, there was no prerequisite criterion for choosing students. We conducted user studies using Internet Explorer 6.0 on Windows XP with 17-inch LCD monitors set at 1,280 pixels by 1,024 pixels in 32-bit color. Data was recorded with server logs and paper-based surveys after each task. Figure 10: User study interface We specifically device an interface for user study as shown in Figure 10. For each pair of fusion methods, participants were encouraged to try any query they wished. For those without specific ideas, two combo boxes (category list and query list) were listed on the bottom panel, where the top 1,000 image search queries from a commercial search engine were provided. After a participant submitted a query, the system randomly selected the left or right frame to display each of the two ranking results. The participant were then required to judge which ranking result was better of the two ranking results, or whether the two ranking results were of equal quality, and submit the judgment by choosing the corresponding radio button and clicking the Submit button. For example, in Figure 10, query sunset is submitted to the system. Then, 79,092 photos were returned and ranked by the Minmax fusion method in the left frame and linear fusion method in the right frame. A participant then compares the two ranking results (without knowing the ranking methods) and submits his/her feedback by choosing answers in the Your option. Table 4: Results of user study Norm.Only Manually Linear Linear 29:13:10 14:22:15Nonlinear 29:15:9 12:27:12 6:4:45 Table 4 shows the experimental results, where Linear denotes the linear fusion method, Nonlinear denotes the non linear fusion method, Norm. Only means Maxmin normalization method, Manually means the manually tuned method. The three numbers in each item, say 29:13:10, mean that 29 judgments prefer the linear fusion results, 10 384 judgments prefer the normalization only method, and 13 judgments consider these two methods as equivalent. We conduct the ANOVA analysis, and obtain the following conclusions: 1. Both the linear and nonlinear methods are significantly better than the Norm. Only method with respective P-values 0.00165(< 0.05) and 0.00073(<< 0.05). This result is consistent with the δ-measure evaluation result. The Norm. Only method assumes that the top 10% photos in different forums are of the same quality. However, this assumption does not stand in general. For example, a top 10% photo in a top tier photo forum is generally of higher quality than a top 10% photo in a second-tier photo forum. This is similar to that, those top 10% students in a top-tier university and those in a second-tier university are generally of different quality. Both linear and nonlinear fusion methods acknowledge the existence of such differences and aim at quantizing the differences. Therefore, they perform better than the Norm. Only method. 2. The linear fusion method is significantly better than the nonlinear one with P-value 1.195 × 10−10 . This result is rather surprising as this more complicated ranking method is expected to tune the ranking more finely than the linear one. The main reason for this result may be that it is difficult to find the best intervals where the nonlinear tuning should be carried out and yet simply the middle part of the Mode-90% Percentile Normalization method was chosen. The timeconsuming and subjective evaluation methods - user studies - blocked us extensively tuning these parameters. 3. The proposed linear and nonlinear methods perform almost the same with or slightly better than the manually tuned method. Given that the linear/nonlinear fusion methods are fully automatic approaches, they are considered practical and efficient solutions when more communities (e.g. dozens of communities) need to be integrated. 4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we studied the Web object-ranking problem in the cases of lacking object relationships where traditional ranking algorithms are no longer valid, and took high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation. We have built a vertical high-quality photo search engine, and proposed score fusion methods which can automatically integrate as many data sources (Web forums) as possible. The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by duplicate photo detection algorithm, and minimize score differences of duplicate photos in different forums. Both the intermediate results and the user studies show that the proposed fusion methods are a practical and efficient solution to Web object ranking in the aforesaid relationships. Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other kinds of Web objects including video clips, poems, short stories, music, drawings, sculptures, and so on. Current system is far from being perfect. In order to make this system more effective, more delicate analysis for the vertical domain (e.g., Web photo forums) are needed. The following points, for example, may improve the searching results and will be our future work: 1. more subtle analysis and then utilization of different kinds of ratings (e.g., novelty ratings, aesthetic ratings); 2. differentiating various communities who may have different interests and preferences or even distinct culture understandings; 3. incorporating more useful information, including photographers and reviewers information, to model the photos in a heterogeneous data space instead of the current homogeneous one. We will further utilize collaborative filtering to recommend relevant high-quality photos to browsers. One open problem is whether we can find an objective and efficient criterion for evaluating the ranking results, instead of employing subjective and inefficient user studies, which blocked us from trying more ranking algorithms and tuning parameters in one algorithm. 5.

Introducción A pesar de los numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de búsqueda de propósito general aún no encuentran resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la búsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento específico del dominio y es más efectivo para conectar a los usuarios con la información que desean. Hay muchos motores de búsqueda vertical, incluidos algunos para la búsqueda en papel (p. Libra [21], CitaSeer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), Búsqueda de productos (p. Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], búsqueda de imágenes [1, 8], búsqueda de video [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia del motor de búsqueda vertical continuará creciendo. Esencialmente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda vertical incluye rastreo de datos, extracción de información, identificación e integración de objetos, y recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o clasificación de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes. Esto se debe a que se ocupa del problema central de cómo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido bien estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía hay algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden clasificarse de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, los algoritmos que evolucionaron de PageRank [22], Poprank [21] y Linkfusion [27] se propusieron a objetos de clasificación provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en gráficos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos. Bien definido significa que los objetos (por ejemplo, los autores en la búsqueda en papel) pueden identificarse en múltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que los objetos heterogéneos estén bien vinculados para formar un gráfico al aprovechar todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, por escrito y publicado) entre las múltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposición no siempre representa algunos dominios. La búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad, la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de Fotograk Forum 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, diferentes foros de fotos parecen carecer de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto hace que sea difícil juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o dos fotos son fotos idénticas. En consecuencia, aunque cada foto tiene una partitura de calificación en un foro, no es trivial para clasificar fotos provenientes de diferentes foros de fotos. También existen problemas similares en la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden identificarse como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar puntajes de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y clasificar las películas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tal relación de objetos no triviales en la que la identificación es relaciones difíciles e incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregación de rango para la web [13, 14] y el algoritmo de aprendizaje para el rango, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. Contrastaremos las diferencias de estos métodos con los métodos propuestos después de haber descrito el problema y nuestros métodos. Nos centraremos específicamente en el problema de rango de objetos web en los casos que carecen de relaciones de objetos o tendremos con relaciones de objetos incompletas, y tomarán búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como el lecho de prueba para esta investigación. A continuación, introduciremos una justificación para construir una búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad.1.1 Búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad En los últimos diez años, Internet se ha convertido en un recurso increíble, lo que permite a los usuarios acceder fácilmente a una gran cantidad de imágenes. Sin embargo, en comparación con los más de mil millones de imágenes indexadas por motores de búsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de búsqueda de imágenes son relativamente menores y ocupan solo el 8-10 por ciento de las consultas totales de imagen y texto enviadas a motores de búsqueda comerciales [24]. Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos del usuario para la búsqueda de imágenes son mucho menores que los de la búsqueda general de texto. Por otro lado, los motores de búsqueda comerciales actuales aún no pueden cumplir con los requisitos de varios usuarios, ya que no existe una solución efectiva y práctica para comprender el contenido de la imagen. Para comprender mejor las necesidades del usuario en la búsqueda de imágenes, realizamos un análisis de registro de consultas basado en un motor de búsqueda comercial. El resultado muestra que más del 20% de las consultas de búsqueda de imágenes están relacionadas con la naturaleza y los lugares y las categorías de vida diaria. Aparentemente, los usuarios están interesados en disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad o buscar hermosas imágenes de ubicaciones u otros tipos. Sin embargo, tales necesidades del usuario no están bien respaldadas por los motores de búsqueda de imágenes actuales debido a la dificultad del problema de evaluación de calidad. Idealmente, la parte más crítica de un motor de búsqueda, la función de clasificación, puede simplificarse como que consta de dos factores clave: relevancia y calidad. Para el factor de relevancia, la búsqueda en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes comerciales actuales proporciona la mayoría de las imágenes devueltas que son bastante relevantes para las consultas, excepto por cierta ambigüedad. Sin embargo, en cuanto al factor de calidad, todavía no hay forma de dar un rango óptimo a una imagen. Aunque la evaluación de calidad de imagen basada en el contenido se ha investigado durante muchos años [23, 25, 26], aún está lejos de estar listo para proporcionar una medida de calidad realista en el futuro inmediato. Aparentemente, realmente parece pesimista construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes que pueda cumplir con el requisito potencialmente grande de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Sin embargo, varias comunidades web en proliferación nos nota que las personas de hoy han creado y compartido muchas fotos de alta calidad en la web sobre prácticamente cualquier temas, que proporcionan una rica fuente para construir un mejor motor de búsqueda de imágenes. En general, las fotos de varios foros de fotos son de mayor calidad que las fotos personales, y también son mucho más atractivas para los usuarios públicos que las fotos personales. Además, las fotos cargadas en foros de fotos generalmente requieren metadatos ricos sobre el título, la configuración de la cámara, la categoría y la descripción que los fotógrafos proporcionarán. Estos metadatos son en realidad las descripciones más precisas para las fotos y, sin duda, se pueden indexar para ayudar a los motores de búsqueda a encontrar resultados relevantes. Más importante, hay usuarios voluntarios en las comunidades web que ofrecen activamente calificaciones valiosas para estas fotos. La información de calificación es generalmente de gran valor para resolver el problema de clasificación de calidad de la foto. Motivado por tales observaciones, hemos estado tratando de construir un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical extrayendo metadatos ricos e integrando información de información sobre varios foros web de fotos. En este documento, nos centramos específicamente en cómo clasificar las fotos de múltiples foros web. Intuitivamente, los puntajes de calificación de diferentes foros de fotos se pueden normalizar empíricamente en función del número de fotos y la cantidad de usuarios en cada foro. Sin embargo, un enfoque tan sencillo generalmente requiere un gran esfuerzo manual tanto en la ajuste de los parámetros tediosos como en la evaluación de resultados subjetivos, lo que lo hace poco práctico cuando hay decenas o cientos de foros de fotos para combinar. Para abordar este problema, buscamos construir relaciones/enlaces entre diferentes foros de fotos. Es decir, primero adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar fotos duplicadas que puedan considerarse como enlaces ocultos que conectan múltiples foros. Luego formulamos el desafío de clasificación como un problema de optimización, lo que eventualmente resulta en una función de clasificación óptima.1.2 Contribuciones y organización principales. Las principales contribuciones de este documento son: 1. Hemos propuesto y creado un motor de búsqueda de imágenes vertical aprovechando metadatos ricos de varios sitios web del foro de fotos para cumplir con los requisitos de los usuarios para buscar y disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, que es imposible en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes tradicionales.2. Hemos propuesto dos tipos de algoritmos de rango de objetos web para fotos con relaciones incompletas, que pueden integrar de manera automática y eficiente tantas comunidades web posibles con información de calificación y logra un resultado cualitativo igual en comparación con el esquema de fusión sintonizado manualmente. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos en detalle las soluciones propuestas al problema de clasificación, incluida cómo encontrar enlaces ocultos entre diferentes foros, normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación, obtener la función de clasificación óptima y contrastar nuestros métodos con algunas otras investigaciones relacionadas. En la Sección 3, describimos el entorno experimental y los experimentos y los estudios de usuarios realizados para evaluar nuestro algoritmo. Nuestra conclusión y una discusión sobre el trabajo futuro es en la Sección 4. Vale la pena señalar que, aunque tratamos la búsqueda de fotos verticales como el lecho de prueba en este documento, el algoritmo de clasificación propuesto también se puede aplicar para clasificar otro contenido que incluye videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, dibujos, esculturas, música, etc..378 2. Algoritmo 2.1 Descripción general La dificultad de integrar múltiples foros web está en sus diferentes sistemas de calificación, donde generalmente hay dos tipos de libertad. El primer tipo de libertad es el intervalo de calificación o la escala de calificación que incluye las calificaciones mínimas y máximas para cada objeto web. Por ejemplo, algunos foros usan una escala de calificación de 5 puntos, mientras que otros foros usan escalas de calificación de 3 puntos o 10 puntos. Parece fácil arreglar esta libertad, pero el análisis detallado de los datos y los experimentos muestran que es un problema no trivial. El segundo tipo de libertad son los criterios de calificación variables que se encuentran en diferentes foros web. Es decir, el mismo puntaje no significa la misma calidad en diferentes foros. Intuitivamente, si podemos detectar los mismos fotógrafos o las mismas fotografías, podemos construir relaciones entre dos foros de fotos y, por lo tanto, podemos estandarizar el criterio de calificación mediante normalización y transformación de puntaje. Afortunadamente, encontramos que existen una gran cantidad de fotografías duplicadas en varios foros de fotos web. Este hecho es razonable al considerar que los fotógrafos a veces envían una foto a más de un foro para obtener críticas o con la esperanza de una publicidad generalizada. En este trabajo, adoptamos un algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicados eficientes [10] para encontrar estas fotos. Los métodos propuestos a continuación se basan en las siguientes consideraciones. Frente a la necesidad de superar un problema de clasificación, se necesita un criterio de calificación estandarizado en lugar de un criterio de calificación razonable. Por lo tanto, podemos tomar un foro a gran escala como foro de referencia y alinear otros foros teniendo en cuenta los objetos web duplicados (fotos duplicadas en este trabajo). Idealmente, las decenas de fotos duplicadas deben ser iguales a pesar de que están en diferentes foros. Sin embargo, podemos considerar que las puntuaciones en diferentes forales sean de Forumcept para el foro de referencia: puede variar en un espacio paramétrico. Esto se puede determinar minimizando la función objetivo definida por la suma de los cuadrados de las diferencias de puntaje. Al formular el problema de clasificación como un problema de optimización que intenta hacer las decenas de fotos duplicadas en los foros de no referencia lo más cerca posible para aquellos en el foro de referencia, podemos resolver efectivamente el problema de clasificación. Por conveniencia, se emplean las siguientes anotaciones. Ski y ¯ski denotan el puntaje total y la puntuación media del objeto web (foto) en el sitio web de KTH, respectivamente. El puntaje total se refiere a la suma de los diversos puntajes de calificación (por ejemplo, calificación de novedad y calificación estética), y la puntuación media se refiere a la media de los diversos puntajes de calificación. Supongamos que hay un total de K sitios web. Usamos aún más {skl i | i = 1, ..., ikl;k, l = 1, ..., k;K = L} para denotar el conjunto de puntajes para objetos web (fotos) en los foros web de KTH que están duplicados con los foros web de LTH, donde IKL es el número total de objetos web duplicados entre estos dos sitios web. En general, la fusión de puntaje puede verse como el procedimiento de encontrar k transformaciones ψk (ski) = eski, k = 1, ..., k tal que ESKI puede usarse para clasificar objetos web de diferentes sitios web. La función objetivo descrita en la Figura 1 anterior: Integración de la comunidad web. Cada comunidad web forma una subgraph, y todas las comunidades están vinculadas juntas por algunos enlaces ocultos (líneas discontinuas).El párrafo se puede formular como min {ψk | k = 2, ..., k} kx k = 2 ik1x i = 1 ¯wk i s1k i - ψk (sk1 i) 2 (1) donde usamos k = 1 comoel foro de referencia y, por lo tanto, ψ1 (s1i) = s1i.¯wk I (≥ 0) es el coeficiente de peso que se puede establecer heurísticamente de acuerdo con el número de votantes (revisores o comentaristas) tanto en el foro de referencia como en el foro de no referencia. Cuantos más revisores, más popular sea la foto y más grande es el peso correspondiente ¯wk, debería ser. En este trabajo, no inspeccionamos el problema de cómo elegir ¯wk I y simplemente establecerlos en uno. Pero creemos que el uso adecuado de ¯wk I, que aprovecha más información, puede mejorar significativamente los resultados. La Figura 1 ilustra la idea antes mencionada. La comunidad web 1 es la comunidad de referencia. Las líneas discontinuas son enlaces que indican que los dos objetos web vinculados son en realidad los mismos. El algoritmo propuesto intentará encontrar el mejor ψk (k = 2, ..., k), que tiene ciertas formas paramétricas de acuerdo con ciertos modelos. Para minimizar la función de costo definida en la ecuación.1, la suma se toma en todas las líneas discontinuas rojas. Primero discutiremos los métodos de normalización de puntaje en la Sección 2.2, que sirve como base para el siguiente trabajo. Antes de describir los algoritmos de clasificación propuestos, primero presentamos un método manualmente sintonizado en la Sección 2.3, que es laborioso e incluso poco práctico cuando el número de comunidades se vuelve grande. En la Sección 2.4, explicaremos brevemente cómo encontrar con precisión las fotos duplicadas entre los foros web. Luego describiremos los dos métodos propuestos: fusión lineal y fusión no lineal, y una medida de rendimiento para la evaluación de resultados en la Sección 2.5. Finalmente, en la Sección 2.6 discutiremos la relación de los métodos propuestos con algún otro trabajo relacionado.2.2 Normalización de puntaje Dado que los foros web (foto) en la web generalmente tienen diferentes criterios de calificación, es necesario normalizarlos antes de aplicar diferentes tipos de métodos de fusión. Además, como hay muchos tipos de calificaciones, como las calificaciones para la novedad, las clasificaciones para la estética, etc., es razonable elegir una puntuación total común o un puntaje promedio siempre se puede extraer en cualquier foro web o calculado por las calificaciones correspondientes. Esto permite que el método de Normaliza379 en la puntuación total o el puntaje promedio se ve como un método de calificación imparcial entre diferentes foros web. Es sencillo normalizar los puntajes promedio transformándolos linealmente en un intervalo fijo. Llamamos a este tipo de puntaje como puntaje promedio escalado. Sin embargo, la dificultad de usar este método de normalización es que, si solo hay unos pocos usuarios que califican un objeto, digamos una foto en un foro de fotos, es probable que el puntaje promedio para el objeto sea spam o sesgado. El puntaje total puede evitar tales inconvenientes que contienen más información, como una calidad y popularidad de los objetos web. El problema es, por lo tanto, cómo normalizar los puntajes totales en diferentes foros web. La forma más simple puede ser la normalización por las puntuaciones máximas y mínimas. El inconveniente de este método de normalización es que no es robusto, o en otras palabras, es sensible a los valores atípicos. Para que la normalización sea insensible a los datos inusuales, proponemos el método de normalización del percentil del 90%. Aquí, el puntaje de modo representa el puntaje total que se ha asignado a más fotos que cualquier otra puntuación total. Y el puntaje de percentil alto (por ejemplo, 90%) representa el puntaje total para el cual el percentil alto de imágenes tiene una puntuación total más baja. Este método de normalización utiliza el modo y el percentil del 90% como dos puntos de referencia para alinear dos sistemas de calificación, lo que hace que las distribuciones de puntajes totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. La suposición subyacente, por ejemplo, en diferentes foros de fotos, es que incluso las cualidades de las mejores fotos en diferentes foros pueden variar mucho y depender menos de la calidad del foro, la distribución de fotos de calidad de nivel medio (desde el modo hasta el 90% percentil) Debe ser casi de la misma calidad hasta la libertad que refleja el criterio de calificación (estricto) de los foros web. Las fotos de este nivel medio en un foro web generalmente ocupan más del 70 % del total de fotos en ese foro. Daremos un análisis más detallado de los puntajes en la Sección 3.2.2.3 Fusión manual El foro de películas web, IMDB [16], propuesta para usar una función de rango bayesiano para normalizar los puntajes de calificación dentro de una comunidad. Motivado por esta función de clasificación, proponemos este método de fusión manual: para el sitio web de KTH, usamos la siguiente fórmula eski = αk · „nk · ¯ski nk + n ∗ k + n ∗ k · s ∗ k nk + n ∗K «(2) para clasificar las fotos, donde nk es el número de votos y n ∗ k, s ∗ k y αk son tres parámetros. Esta función de clasificación primero toma un equilibrio entre la puntuación media original ¯ski y una puntuación de referencia S ∗ K para obtener una puntuación media ponderada que puede ser más confiable que ¯ski. Luego, la puntuación media ponderada es escalada por αK para obtener la puntuación final FSKI. Para las comunidades web, hay alrededor de 3n parámetros en {(αk, n ∗ k, s ∗ k) | k = 1, ..., n} para sintonizar. Aunque este método puede lograr resultados bastante buenos después de un ajuste manual cuidadoso y exhaustivo en estos parámetros, cuando N se vuelve cada vez más grande, digamos que hay decenas o cientos de comunidades web arrastradas e indexadas, este método se volverá cada vez más laborioso y eventualmente se volverá poco práctico.. Por lo tanto, es deseable encontrar un método de fusión efectivo cuyos parámetros se pueden determinar automáticamente.2.4 Detección de fotos duplicados Usamos Dedup [10], un algoritmo de detección de imágenes duplicados eficientes y efectivos, para encontrar fotos duplicadas entre dos foros de fotos. Este algoritmo utiliza la función hash para asignar una característica dimensional de alta dimensión a un código hash de 32 bits (consulte a continuación cómo construir el código hash). Su complejidad computacional para encontrar todas las imágenes duplicadas entre n imágenes es sobre O (n log n). La característica visual de bajo nivel para cada foto se extrae en cuadrículas regulares K × K. Según todas las características extraídas de la base de datos de imágenes, se crea un modelo PCA. Las características visuales se transforman en un espacio PCA medio de dimensión relativamente baja y cero, o 29 dimensiones en nuestro sistema. Luego, el código hash para cada foto se construye de la siguiente manera: cada dimensión se transforma en una, si el valor en esta dimensión es mayor que 0 y 0 de lo contrario. Las fotos en el mismo cubo se consideran duplicados potenciales y se filtran aún más por un umbral en términos de similitud euclidiana en el espacio de características visuales. La Figura 2 ilustra el procedimiento de hash, donde las características visuales, los valores medios de grises, se extraen en cuadrículas 6 × 6 y 7 × 7. Las características de 85 dimensiones se transforman en un vector de 32 dimensiones, y el código hash se genera de acuerdo con los signos. Figura 2: Procedimiento de hash para la fusión de puntaje duplicada de la fotografía 2.5 En esta sección, presentaremos dos soluciones en la fusión de puntaje basadas en diferentes supuestos de forma paramétrica de ψk en la ecuación.1. 2.5.1 Fusión lineal por fotos duplicadas de manera intuitiva, la forma más directa de factorizar las incertidumbres causadas por el criterio diferente es escalar, relajado a un centro determinado, las puntuaciones totales de cada foro de fotos web no referenciado con respecto alForo de referencia. Más estrictamente, suponemos que ψk tiene la siguiente forma ψk (ski) = αkski + tk, k = 2, ..., k (3) ψ1 (s1i) = s1i (4), lo que significa que las puntuaciones de k (= 1) El foro debe ser escalado por αK en relación con el centro TK 1 - αk como se muestra en la Figura 3. Entonces, si sustituimos arriba ψk a la ecuación.1, obtenemos la siguiente función objetivo, min {αk, tk | k = 2, ..., k} kx k = 2 ik1x i = 1 ¯wk i h s1k i - αksk1 i - tk i2.(5) Al resolver el siguiente conjunto de funciones, (∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0, k = 1, ..., k donde f es la función objetivo definida en la ecuación 5, obtenemos elsolución de forma cerrada como: „αk tk« = a - 1 k lk (6) donde ak = „p i ¯wi (sk1 i) 2 p i ¯wisk1 ip i ¯wisk1 i p i ¯wi« (7) lk =„P I ¯wis1k I Sk1 IP I ¯wis1k I« (8) y k = 2, ..., K. Este es un método de fusión lineal. Disfruta de simplicidad y excelente rendimiento en los siguientes experimentos. Figura 3: Método de fusión lineal 2.5.2 Fusión no lineal por fotos duplicadas A veces queremos un método que pueda ajustar las puntuaciones en los intervalos con dos puntos finales sin cambios. Como se ilustra en la Figura 4, el método puede ajustar las puntuaciones entre [C0, C1] mientras deja los puntajes C0 y C1 sin cambios. Este tipo de método de fusión es mucho más fino que el lineal y contiene muchos más parámetros para sintonizar y esperar mejorar aún más los resultados. Aquí, proponemos una solución de fusión no lineal para satisfacer tales restricciones. Primero, introducimos una transformación: ηc0, c1, α (x) = (x - c0 c1 - c0 α (c1 - c0) + c0, si x ∈ (c0, c1] x de lo contrario donde α> 0. Esta transformación satisface que para x ∈ [C0, C1], ηc0, C1, α (x) ∈ [C0, C1] con ηc0, C1, α (C0) = C0 y ηc0, C1, α (C1) = C1. Luego podemos utilizar esta transformación no lineal para ajustar las puntuaciones en cierto intervalo, digamos (m, t], ψk (ski) = ηm, t, α (ski). (9) Figura 4: método de fusión no lineal. Intentamos ajustar finamente la forma de las curvas en cada segmento. Incluso no hay una solución de forma cerrada para el siguiente problema de optimización, min {αk | k∈ [2, k]} kx k = 2 ik1x i = 1 ¯wk i h s1k i-ηm, t, α (ski) i2 it it it it itNo es difícil obtener el numérico. Bajo los mismos supuestos realizados en la Sección 2.2, podemos usar este método para ajustar las puntuaciones del nivel medio (desde el punto de modo hasta el percentil del 90 %). Se espera que este método de fusión no lineal más complicado alcance mejores resultados que el lineal. Sin embargo, las dificultades para evaluar los resultados de rango nos impiden ajustar estos parámetros ampliamente. Los experimentos actuales en la Sección 3.5 no revelan ninguna ventaja sobre el modelo lineal simple.2.5.3 Medida de rendimiento de los resultados de la fusión Dado que nuestra función objetivo es hacer las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web (por ejemplo, fotos duplicadas) entre un foro de no referencia y el foro de referencia lo más cerca posible, es natural investigar qué tan cerca estánel uno al otro y cómo los puntajes de los mismos objetos web cambian entre los dos foros no referentes antes y después de la fusión de puntaje. Tomada en la Figura 1 como ejemplo, los algoritmos propuestos minimizan las diferencias de puntaje de los mismos objetos web en dos foros web: el foro de referencia (la comunidad web 1) y un foro de no referencia, que corresponde a minimizar la función de objetivo en el rojoenlaces discontinuos (ocultos). Después de la optimización, debemos preguntarnos qué sucede con las diferencias de puntaje de los mismos objetos web en dos foros de no referencia. ¿O, en otras palabras, si las puntuaciones de dos objetos vinculados por los enlaces discontinuos (ocultos) se vuelven más consistentes? Por lo tanto, definimos la siguiente medida de medida de rendimiento, para cuantificar los cambios para las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web en diferentes foros web que ΔKl = SIM (SLK, SKL) - SIM (SLK ∗, SKL ∗) (10) 381 donde skl = (((Skl 1, ..., skl ikl) t, skl ∗ = (eskl 1, ..., eskl ikl) t y sim (a, b) = a · b || a |||| b ||.ΔKl> 0 significa después de la fusión de puntaje, los puntajes en los mismos objetos web entre el foro web KTH y LTH se vuelven más consistentes, que es lo que esperamos. Por el contrario, si ΔKl <0, esos puntajes se vuelven más inconsistentes. Aunque no podemos confiar en esta medida para evaluar nuestros resultados finales de fusión, ya que la clasificación de fotos por su popularidad y cualidades es un proceso tan subjetivo que cada persona puede tener sus propios resultados, puede ayudarnos a comprender los resultados de clasificación intermedia y proporcionar información sobre la finalactuaciones de diferentes métodos de clasificación.2.6 Contrasts con otro trabajo relacionado ya hemos mencionado las diferencias de los métodos propuestos con los métodos tradicionales, como los algoritmos PageRank [22], Poprank [21] y Linkfusion [27] en la Sección 1. Aquí, discutimos algunas otras obras relacionadas. El problema actual también se puede ver como una agregación de rango una [13, 14] mientras abordamos el problema de cómo combinar varias listas de rango. Sin embargo, existen diferencias fundamentales entre ellos. En primer lugar, a diferencia de las páginas web, que se pueden detectar de manera fácil y precisa como las mismas páginas, detectar las mismas fotos en diferentes foros web es un trabajo no trivial, y solo puede ser implementado por algunos algoritmos delicados, mientras que con cierta precisión yrecordar. En segundo lugar, los números de las fotos duplicadas de diferentes foros web son pequeños en relación con los conjuntos de fotos completos (ver Tabla 1). En otras palabras, las listas de rango K Top K de diferentes foros web están casi desarticulados para una consulta dada. Bajo esta condición, tanto los algoritmos propuestos en [13] como en sus mediciones, la distancia de Kendall Tau o la distancia del fútbol de Spearman, degenerará a algunos casos triviales. Otra categoría de métodos de fusión de rango (agregación) se basa en algoritmos de aprendizaje automático, como RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15] y RankNet [12]. Todos estos métodos implican algunos conjuntos de datos etiquetados para entrenar un modelo. En los entornos actuales, es difícil o incluso imposible obtener estos conjuntos de datos etiquetados en cuanto a su nivel de profesionalismo o popularidad, ya que las fotos son demasiado vagas y subjetivas para el rango. En cambio, el problema aquí es cómo combinar varias subconscidades ordenadas para formar una lista de pedidos totales.3. Experimentos En esta sección, realizamos nuestra investigación sobre la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. Primero presentamos brevemente el motor de búsqueda de imágenes vertical recientemente propuesto: disfrutar de la sección 3.1. Luego nos centramos en cómo clasificar las fotos de diferentes foros web. Para hacerlo, primero normalizamos los puntajes (calificaciones) para fotos de diferentes foros web múltiples en la Sección 3.2. Luego intentamos encontrar fotos duplicadas en la Sección 3.3. Algunos resultados intermedios se discuten utilizando la medida δ en la Sección 3.4. Finalmente, un conjunto de estudios de usuarios se lleva a cabo cuidadosamente para justificar nuestro método propuesto en la Sección 3.5.3.1 Disfrutar de: motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad Para cumplir con los requisitos del usuario de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, proponemos y construimos un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad: disfrutar Photo, que representa los siguientes tres problemas clave: 1. Cómo arrastrary fotos de índice, 2. Cómo determinar las cualidades de cada foto y 3. Cómo mostrar los resultados de búsqueda para que el proceso de búsqueda sea agradable. Para una consulta basada en texto dada, este sistema clasifica las fotos basadas en cierta combinación de relevancia de la foto a esta consulta (número 1) y la calidad de la foto (número 2), y finalmente las muestra de manera agradable (número 3). En cuanto al número 3, diseñamos la interfaz del sistema deliberadamente para suavizar el proceso de usuarios de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Las técnicas, como Fisheye y Slides muestran, se utilizan en el sistema actual. La Figura 5 muestra la interfaz. No hablaremos más sobre este tema, ya que no es un énfasis de este documento. Figura 5: disfrutar de: un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad agradable, donde se devuelven 26,477 registros para que la consulta caiga en aproximadamente 0.421 segundos en cuanto al número 1, extraemos de un motor de búsqueda comercial un subconjunto de fotos que provienen de varios foros de fotos en todas partes.el mundo, y analizó explícitamente las páginas web que contienen estas fotos. El número de fotos en la recopilación de datos es de aproximadamente 2.5 millones. Después del análisis, cada foto se asoció con su título, categoría, descripción, configuración de la cámara, datos exif 1 (cuando está disponible para imágenes digitales), ubicación (cuando estuviera disponible en algunos foros de fotos) y muchos tipos de calificaciones. Todos estos metadatos son generalmente descripciones o anotaciones precisas para el contenido de la imagen, que luego son indexados por tecnologías de búsqueda generales basadas en texto [9, 18, 11]. En el sistema actual, la función de clasificación se sintonizó específicamente para enfatizar la información del título, la categorización y la calificación. El número 2 se trata esencialmente en las siguientes secciones que derivan la calidad de las fotos analizando las calificaciones proporcionadas por varios foros de fotos web. Aquí elegimos seis foros de fotos para estudiar el problema de clasificación y denotarlos como Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E y Web-F.3.2 Photo Score Normalización El análisis detallado de diferentes métodos de normalización de puntaje se analizan en esta sección. En este análisis, las cámaras digitales cero 1 guardan archivos JPEG (.jpg) con datos exif (archivo de imagen intercambiable). La cámara y la información de la escena son grabadas por la cámara en el archivo de imagen.www.digicamhelp.com/what-is-exif/ 382 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (a) Web-A 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 normalizadoPuntaje TotalNumber (b) Web-B 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 5 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (C) Web-C 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 4 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (d) Web-D 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (E) Web-E 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 x 10 4 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (F)Web-F Figura 6: Las distribuciones de puntajes medios normalizados a los puntajes [0, 10] que generalmente ocupan aproximadamente el 30% del número total de fotos para algunos foros web no se tienen en cuenta actualmente. Cómo utilizar estas fotos se deja para futuras exploraciones. En la Figura 6, enumeramos las distribuciones de la puntuación media, que se transforma en un intervalo fijo [0, 10]. Las distribuciones de los puntajes promedio de estos foros web se ven bastante diferentes. Las distribuciones en la Figura 6 (a), 6 (b) y 6 (e) se parecen a distribuciones gaussianas, mientras que las de la Figura 6 (d) y 6 (f) están dominadas por la puntuación superior. La razón de estas distribuciones excéntricas para Web-D y Web-F se encuentra en sus sistemas de calificación gruesa. De hecho, Web-D y Web-F usan escalas de calificación de 2 o 3 puntos, mientras que otros foros web usan escalas de calificación de 7 o 14 puntos. Por lo tanto, será problemático si usamos directamente estos puntajes promedio. Además, es muy probable que el puntaje promedio se spam, si solo hay unos pocos usuarios que califican una foto. La Figura 7 muestra el método de normalización de puntaje total por puntajes máximos y mínimos, que es uno de nuestro sistema de línea base. Todos los puntajes totales de un foro web dado se normalizan a [0, 100] de acuerdo con el puntaje máximo y el puntaje mínimo del foro web correspondiente. Notamos que la distribución total de puntaje de Web-A en la Figura 7 (a) tiene dos colas más grandes que todas las demás. Para mostrar la forma de las distribuciones más claramente, solo mostramos las distribuciones en [0, 25] en la Figura 7 (b), 7 (c), 7 (d), 7 (e) y 7 (f). La Figura 8 muestra el método de normalización del percentil Mode-90%, donde los modos de las seis distribuciones se normalizan a 5 y el percentil del 90% a 8. Podemos ver que este método de normalización hace que las distribuciones de puntajes totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. Los dos algoritmos propuestos se basan en estos métodos de normalización.3.3 Detección de fotos duplicada Dirección de eficiencia computacional, el algoritmo DEDUP puede perder alguna tasa de recuperación, pero puede lograr una alta tasa de precisión. También nos centramos en encontrar enlaces ocultos precisos en lugar de todos los enlaces ocultos. La Figura 9 muestra algunos ejemplos de detección duplicados. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 y verifican que existan grandes cantidades de fotos duplicadas en dos foros web, incluso con la condición estricta para DEDUP, donde elegimos los primeros 29 bits como código hash. Dado que solo hay unos pocos parámetros para estimar en los métodos de fusión propuestos, los números de fotos duplicadas que se muestran la Tabla 1 son 0 20 40 60 80 80 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (A) Web-A 0 5 10 1520 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 5 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (C) Web-C 0 5 10 15 20 250 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (D) Web-D 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (E) Web-E 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2 2 22.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (F) Web-F Figura 7: Máxmin normalización 0 5 10 15 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5x 10 4 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 4 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (C) Web-C 0 5 10 15 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 NormalizadoPuntaje TotalNumber (D) Web-D 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (E) Web-E 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 8000 10000 Puntuación normalizada TotalNumber (F) Web-F Figura 8:MODE-90% Normalización del percentil suficiente para determinar estos parámetros. La última columna de la tabla enumera el número total de fotos en los foros web correspondientes.3.4 Δ Medido Los parámetros de los algoritmos lineales y no lineales propuestos se calculan utilizando los datos duplicados que se muestran en la Tabla 1, donde el Web-C se elige como el foro web de referencia, ya que comparte las fotos más duplicadas con otros foros. La Tabla 2 y 3 muestran la medida δ en el modelo lineal y el modelo no lineal. Como ΔKl es simétrico y ΔKK = 0, solo mostramos la parte triangular superior. Los valores de NAN en ambas tablas se encuentran en que el algoritmo DEDUP ha detectado las fotos duplicadas como se informa en la Tabla 1. El modelo lineal garantiza que las medidas Δ relacionadas con la Tabla 1: Número de fotos duplicadas entre cada par de foros web a b c d e f escala a 0 316 1,386 178 302 0 130k b 316 0 14,708 909 8,023 348 675K C 1,386 14,708 0 1,508 19,271 1,083 1,003k D178 909 1,508 0 1,084 21 155K E 302 8,023 19,271 1,084 0 98 448K F 0 348 1,083 21 98 0 122K 383 Figura 9: Algunos resultados de Duplicado Tabla de detección de fotos 2: δ Medición en el modelo lineal.

De hecho, es el caso (ver los números subrayados en la Tabla 2). Pero este modelo no puede garantizar que las medidas δ en las comunidades de no referencia tampoco puedan ser menos de 0, ya que los pasos de normalización se basan en fotos duplicadas entre la comunidad de referencia y una comunidad de no referencia. Los resultados muestran que todos los números en la medida δ son mayores que 0 (ver todos los números no subrayados en la Tabla 2), lo que indica que es probable que este modelo dé resultados óptimos. Por el contrario, el modelo no lineal no garantiza que las medidas de δ relacionadas con la comunidad de referencia no sean menos de 0, ya que no todas las fotos duplicadas entre los dos foros web se pueden usar al optimizar este modelo. De hecho, las fotos duplicadas que se encuentran en diferentes intervalos no se utilizarán en este modelo. Son estas fotos duplicadas específicas las que hacen que la medida δ sea negativa. Como resultado, hay elementos negativos y positivos en la Tabla 3, pero en general el número de positivos es mayor que los negativos (9: 5), que indica que el modelo puede ser mejor que el método de normalización solo (ver Next Subsection)que tiene una medida δ totalmente cero, y peor que el modelo lineal.3.5 Estudio del usuario porque es difícil encontrar un criterio objetivo para evaluar la Tabla 3: Medida δ en el modelo no lineal.

Diez sujetos fueron invitados a participar en el estudio del usuario. Fueron reclutados de universidades cercanas. Como los motores de búsqueda de la búsqueda de texto y la búsqueda de imágenes son familiares para los estudiantes universitarios, no hubo un criterio de requisitos previos para elegir a los estudiantes. Realizamos estudios de usuarios con Internet Explorer 6.0 en Windows XP con monitores LCD de 17 pulgadas establecidos en 1,280 píxeles por 1,024 píxeles en color de 32 bits. Los datos se registraron con registros de servidores y encuestas en papel después de cada tarea. Figura 10: Interfaz de estudio del usuario específicamente que diseñamos una interfaz para el estudio del usuario como se muestra en la Figura 10. Para cada par de métodos de fusión, se alentó a los participantes a probar cualquier consulta que quisieran. Para aquellos sin ideas específicas, se enumeraron dos cuadros combinados (lista de categorías y lista de consultas) en el panel inferior, donde se proporcionaron las 1,000 consultas de búsqueda de imágenes principales de un motor de búsqueda comercial. Después de que un participante presentó una consulta, el sistema seleccionó aleatoriamente el marco izquierdo o derecho para mostrar cada uno de los dos resultados de clasificación. Luego se requirió que el participante juzgara qué resultado de clasificación fue mejor de los dos resultados de clasificación, o si los dos resultados de clasificación fueron de igual calidad, y enviar el juicio eligiendo el botón de radio correspondiente y haciendo clic en el botón Enviar. Por ejemplo, en la Figura 10, la puesta de sol de consulta se envía al sistema. Luego, 79,092 fotos fueron devueltas y clasificadas por el método de fusión Minmax en el marco izquierdo y el método de fusión lineal en el marco derecho. Luego, un participante compara los dos resultados de clasificación (sin conocer los métodos de clasificación) y presenta sus comentarios eligiendo respuestas en su opción. Tabla 4: Resultados de la norma de estudio del usuario. Solo lineal lineal manual 29:13:10 14: 22: 15 Nonlinear 29: 15: 15 12:27:12 6: 4: 45 La Tabla 4 muestra los resultados experimentales, donde lineal denota linealMétodo de fusión, no lineal denota el método de fusión no lineal, norma. Solo significa el método de normalización de maxmin, significa manualmente el método ajustado manualmente. Los tres números en cada elemento, digamos 29:13:10, significan que 29 juicios prefieren los resultados de la fusión lineal, 10 384 juicios prefieren el método de normalización solo y 13 juicios consideran estos dos métodos como equivalentes. Realizamos el análisis ANOVA y obtenemos las siguientes conclusiones: 1. Los métodos lineales y no lineales son significativamente mejores que la norma. Solo método con valores p respectivos 0.00165 (<0.05) y 0.00073 (<< 0.05). Este resultado es consistente con el resultado de la evaluación de la medida δ. La norma. El único método supone que las fotos del 10% principales en diferentes foros son de la misma calidad. Sin embargo, esta suposición no se mantiene en general. Por ejemplo, una foto del 10% superior en un foro de fotos de primer nivel es generalmente de mayor calidad que una foto del 10% superior en un foro de fotos de segundo nivel. Esto es similar a eso, esos 10% de los mejores estudiantes en una universidad de primer nivel y los de una universidad de segundo nivel son generalmente de diferente calidad. Los métodos de fusión lineales y no lineales reconocen la existencia de tales diferencias y tienen como objetivo cuantificar las diferencias. Por lo tanto, funcionan mejor que la norma. Solo método.2. El método de fusión lineal es significativamente mejor que el no lineal con valor p 1.195 × 10-10. Este resultado es bastante sorprendente, ya que se espera que este método de clasificación más complicado sintonice la clasificación más finamente que la lineal. La razón principal de este resultado puede ser que es difícil encontrar los mejores intervalos en los que se debe llevar a cabo el ajuste no lineal y, sin embargo, simplemente se eligió la parte media del método de normalización del percentil MODE-90%. Los métodos de evaluación subjetivos y subjetivos - Estudios de usuarios - nos bloquearon ampliamente ajustando estos parámetros.3. Los métodos lineales y no lineales propuestos funcionan casi igual o ligeramente mejor que el método sintonizado manualmente. Dado que los métodos de fusión lineal/no lineal son enfoques totalmente automáticos, se consideran soluciones prácticas y eficientes cuando se deben integrar más comunidades (por ejemplo, docenas de comunidades).4. Conclusiones y trabajo futuro En este documento, estudiamos el problema de rango de objetos web en los casos de falta de relaciones de objetos donde los algoritmos de clasificación tradicionales ya no son válidos, y tomamos una búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como la cama de prueba para esta investigación. Hemos creado un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical de alta calidad y métodos de fusión de puntaje propuestos que pueden integrar automáticamente la mayor cantidad de fuentes de datos (foros web) como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por el algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicados y minimizan las diferencias de puntaje de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuarios muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son una solución práctica y eficiente para la clasificación de objetos web en las relaciones antes mencionadas. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros tipos de objetos web que incluyen videoclips, poemas, cuentos, música, dibujos, esculturas, etc. El sistema actual está lejos de ser perfecto. Para hacer que este sistema sea más efectivo, se necesitan un análisis más delicado para el dominio vertical (por ejemplo, foros de fotos web). Los siguientes puntos, por ejemplo, pueden mejorar los resultados de búsqueda y serán nuestro trabajo futuro: 1. Análisis más sutil y luego utilización de diferentes tipos de calificaciones (por ejemplo, calificaciones de novedad, calificaciones estéticas);2. Diferenciar a varias comunidades que pueden tener diferentes intereses y preferencias o incluso entendimientos culturales distintos;3. Incorporar información más útil, incluida la información de los fotógrafos y revisores, para modelar las fotos en un espacio de datos heterogéneo en lugar del homogéneo actual. Utilizaremos aún más el filtrado colaborativo para recomendar fotos relevantes de alta calidad a los navegadores. Un problema abierto es si podemos encontrar un criterio objetivo y eficiente para evaluar los resultados de la clasificación, en lugar de emplear estudios de usuarios subjetivos e ineficientes, lo que nos impidió probar más algoritmos de clasificación y ajustar los parámetros en un algoritmo.5.

        "49, Zhichun Road Haidian District, Beijing, 100080, P R China ABSTRACT Vertical search is a promising direction as it leverages domainspecific knowledge and can provide more precise information for users.",
        "In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a vertical search engine.",
        "More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
        "We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible.",
        "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
        "Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described.",
        "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval; G.2.2 [Discrete Mathematics]: Graph Theory; H.3.5 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Online Information Services - Web-based services General Terms Algorithms, Experimentation 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.",
        "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
        "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
        "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
        "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
        "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
        "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
        "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
        "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
        "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
        "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
        "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
        "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
        "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
        "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
        "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
        "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
        "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",
        "Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.",
        "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",
        "We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.",
        "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",
        "We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods.",
        "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
        "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
        "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
        "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
        "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
        "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
        "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
        "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
        "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
        "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
        "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
        "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
        "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
        "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
        "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
        "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
        "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
        "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
        "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
        "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
        "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
        "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
        "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
        "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
        "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
        "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
        "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
        "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
        "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
        "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
        "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
        "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
        "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
        "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
        "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
        "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
        "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
        "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
        "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
        "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
        "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
        "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
        "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
        "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
        "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
        "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
        "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
        "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
        "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
        "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
        "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
        "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
        "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
        "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
        "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
        "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
        "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
        "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
        "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
        "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
        "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
        "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
        "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
        "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
        "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
        "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
        "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
        "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
        "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
        "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
        "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
        "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
        "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
        "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
        "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
        "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
        "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
        "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
        "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
        "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
        "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
        "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
        "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
        "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
        "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
        "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
        "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
        "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
        "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
        "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
        "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
        "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
        "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
        "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
        "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
        "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
        "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
        "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
        "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
        "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
        "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
        "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
        "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
        "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
        "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
        "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
        "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
        "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
        "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
        "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
        "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
        "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
        "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
        "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
        "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
        "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
        "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
        "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
        "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
        "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
        "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
        "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
        "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
        "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
        "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
        "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
        "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
        "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
        "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
        "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
        "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
        "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",
        "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we carry out our research on high-quality photo search.",
        "We first briefly introduce the newly proposed vertical image search engine - EnjoyPhoto in section 3.1.",
        "Then we focus on how to rank photos from different Web forums.",
        "In order to do so, we first normalize the scores (ratings) for photos from different multiple Web forums in section 3.2.",
        "Then we try to find duplicate photos in section 3.3.",
        "Some intermediate results are discussed using δ measure in section 3.4.",
        "Finally a set of user studies is carried out carefully to justify our proposed method in section 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: high-quality Photo Search Engine In order to meet user requirement of enjoying high-quality photos, we propose and build a high-quality photo search engine - EnjoyPhoto, which accounts for the following three key issues: 1. how to crawl and index photos, 2. how to determine the qualities of each photo and 3. how to display the search results in order to make the search process enjoyable.",
        "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",
        "As for Issue 3, we devise the interface of the system deliberately in order to smooth the users process of enjoying high-quality photos.",
        "Techniques, such as Fisheye and slides show, are utilized in current system.",
        "Figure 5 shows the interface.",
        "We will not talk more about this issue as it is not an emphasis of this paper.",
        "Figure 5: EnjoyPhoto: an enjoyable high-quality photo search engine, where 26,477 records are returned for the query fall in about 0.421 seconds As for Issue 1, we extracted from a commercial search engine a subset of photos coming from various photo forums all over the world, and explicitly parsed the Web pages containing these photos.",
        "The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million.",
        "After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings.",
        "All these metadata are generally precise descriptions or annotations for the image content, which are then indexed by general text-based search technologies [9, 18, 11].",
        "In current system, the ranking function was specifically tuned to emphasize title, categorization, and rating information.",
        "Issue 2 is essentially dealt with in the following sections which derive the quality of photos by analyzing ratings provided by various Web photo forums.",
        "Here we chose six photo forums to study the ranking problem and denote them as Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E and Web-F. 3.2 Photo Score Normalization Detailed analysis of different score normalization methods are analyzed in this section.",
        "In this analysis, the zero 1 Digital cameras save JPEG (.jpg) files with EXIF (Exchangeable Image File) data.",

        "How to utilize these photos is left for future explorations.",
        "In Figure 6, we list the distributions of the mean score, which is transformed to a fixed interval [0, 10].",
        "The distributions of the average scores of these Web forums look quite different.",
        "Distributions in Figure 6(a), 6(b), and 6(e) looks like Gaussian distributions, while those in Figure 6(d) and 6(f) are dominated by the top score.",
        "The reason of these eccentric distributions for Web-D and Web-F lies in their coarse rating systems.",
        "In fact, Web-D and Web-F use 2 or 3 point rating scales whereas other Web forums use 7 or 14 point rating scales.",
        "Therefore, it will be problematic if we directly use these averaged scores.",
        "Furthermore the average score is very likely to be spammed, if there are only a few users rating a photo.",
        "Figure 7 shows the total score normalization method by maximal and minimal scores, which is one of our base line system.",
        "All the total scores of a given Web forum are normalized to [0, 100] according to the maximal score and minimal score of corresponding Web forum.",
        "We notice that total score distribution of Web-A in Figure 7(a) has two larger tails than all the others.",
        "To show the shape of the distributions more clearly, we only show the distributions on [0, 25] in Figure 7(b),7(c),7(d),7(e), and 7(f).",
        "Figure 8 shows the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method, where the modes of the six distributions are normalized to 5 and the 90% percentile to 8.",
        "We can see that this normalization method makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
        "The two proposed algorithms are all based on these normalization methods. 3.3 Duplicate photo detection Targeting at computational efficiency, the Dedup algorithm may lose some recall rate, but can achieve a high precision rate.",
        "We also focus on finding precise hidden links rather than all hidden links.",
        "Figure 9 shows some duplicate detection examples.",
        "The results are shown in Table 1 and verify that large numbers of duplicate photos exist in any two Web forums even with the strict condition for Dedup where we chose first 29 bits as the hash code.",

        "Both the intermediate results and the user studies show that the proposed fusion methods are a practical and efficient solution to Web object ranking in the aforesaid relationships.",
        "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other kinds of Web objects including video clips, poems, short stories, music, drawings, sculptures, and so on.",
        "Current system is far from being perfect.",
        "In order to make this system more effective, more delicate analysis for the vertical domain (e.g., Web photo forums) are needed.",
        "The following points, for example, may improve the searching results and will be our future work: 1. more subtle analysis and then utilization of different kinds of ratings (e.g., novelty ratings, aesthetic ratings); 2. differentiating various communities who may have different interests and preferences or even distinct culture understandings; 3. incorporating more useful information, including photographers and reviewers information, to model the photos in a heterogeneous data space instead of the current homogeneous one.",
        "We will further utilize collaborative filtering to recommend relevant high-quality photos to browsers.",
        "One open problem is whether we can find an objective and efficient criterion for evaluating the ranking results, instead of employing subjective and inefficient user studies, which blocked us from trying more ranking algorithms and tuning parameters in one algorithm. 5.",

                "In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a <br>vertical search</br> engine.",
                "More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible.",
                "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
                "Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described.",
                "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.",

                "INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.",
                "As a new trend, <br>vertical search</br> has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many <br>vertical search</br> engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the <br>vertical search</br> engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building <br>vertical search</br> engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building <br>vertical search</br> engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
                "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",
                "Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.",
                "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",
                "We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.",
                "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",
                "We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods.",
                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",

                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",

                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "In order to do so, we first normalize the scores (ratings) for photos from different multiple Web forums in section 3.2.",

                "Finally a set of user studies is carried out carefully to justify our proposed method in section 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: high-quality Photo Search Engine In order to meet user requirement of enjoying high-quality photos, we propose and build a high-quality photo search engine - EnjoyPhoto, which accounts for the following three key issues: 1. how to crawl and index photos, 2. how to determine the qualities of each photo and 3. how to display the search results in order to make the search process enjoyable.",
                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",

                "The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million.",
                "After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings.",
                "All these metadata are generally precise descriptions or annotations for the image content, which are then indexed by general text-based search technologies [9, 18, 11].",

                "The reason of these eccentric distributions for Web-D and Web-F lies in their coarse rating systems.",
                "In fact, Web-D and Web-F use 2 or 3 point rating scales whereas other Web forums use 7 or 14 point rating scales.",
                "Therefore, it will be problematic if we directly use these averaged scores.",

                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",

                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",

                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",

                "The proposed linear and nonlinear methods perform almost the same with or slightly better than the manually tuned method.",
                "Given that the linear/nonlinear fusion methods are fully automatic approaches, they are considered practical and efficient solutions when more communities (e.g. dozens of communities) need to be integrated. 4.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we studied the Web object-ranking problem in the cases of lacking object relationships where traditional ranking algorithms are no longer valid, and took high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "We have built a vertical high-quality photo search engine, and proposed score fusion methods which can automatically integrate as many data sources (Web forums) as possible.",
                "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by duplicate photo detection algorithm, and minimize score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
                "Both the intermediate results and the user studies show that the proposed fusion methods are a practical and efficient solution to Web object ranking in the aforesaid relationships.",
                "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other kinds of Web objects including video clips, poems, short stories, music, drawings, sculptures, and so on.",
                "Current system is far from being perfect.",
                "In order to make this system more effective, more delicate analysis for the vertical domain (e.g., Web photo forums) are needed.",
                "The following points, for example, may improve the searching results and will be our future work: 1. more subtle analysis and then utilization of different kinds of ratings (e.g., novelty ratings, aesthetic ratings); 2. differentiating various communities who may have different interests and preferences or even distinct culture understandings; 3. incorporating more useful information, including photographers and reviewers information, to model the photos in a heterogeneous data space instead of the current homogeneous one.",
                "We will further utilize collaborative filtering to recommend relevant high-quality photos to browsers.",
                "One open problem is whether we can find an objective and efficient criterion for evaluating the ranking results, instead of employing subjective and inefficient user studies, which blocked us from trying more ranking algorithms and tuning parameters in one algorithm. 5.",

                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
                "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",

                "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of <br>web object-ranking</br> algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we carry out our research on high-quality photo search.",
                "We first briefly introduce the newly proposed vertical image search engine - EnjoyPhoto in section 3.1.",
                "Then we focus on how to rank photos from different Web forums.",
                "In order to do so, we first normalize the scores (ratings) for photos from different multiple Web forums in section 3.2.",
                "Then we try to find duplicate photos in section 3.3.",
                "Some intermediate results are discussed using δ measure in section 3.4.",
                "Finally a set of user studies is carried out carefully to justify our proposed method in section 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: high-quality Photo Search Engine In order to meet user requirement of enjoying high-quality photos, we propose and build a high-quality photo search engine - EnjoyPhoto, which accounts for the following three key issues: 1. how to crawl and index photos, 2. how to determine the qualities of each photo and 3. how to display the search results in order to make the search process enjoyable.",
                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",
                "As for Issue 3, we devise the interface of the system deliberately in order to smooth the users process of enjoying high-quality photos.",

                "The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million.",
                "After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings.",
                "All these metadata are generally precise descriptions or annotations for the image content, which are then indexed by general text-based search technologies [9, 18, 11].",
                "In current system, the ranking function was specifically tuned to emphasize title, categorization, and rating information.",

                "The reason of these eccentric distributions for Web-D and Web-F lies in their coarse rating systems.",
                "In fact, Web-D and Web-F use 2 or 3 point rating scales whereas other Web forums use 7 or 14 point rating scales.",
                "Therefore, it will be problematic if we directly use these averaged scores.",
                "Furthermore the average score is very likely to be spammed, if there are only a few users rating a photo.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",

                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",

                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take <br>high-quality photo search</br> as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building <br>high-quality photo search</br>. 1.1 <br>high-quality photo search</br> In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we carry out our research on <br>high-quality photo search</br>.",

                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",

                "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
                "Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described.",
                "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.",

                "INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.",
                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
                "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",
                "Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.",
                "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",

                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of <br>image search queries</br> are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",

                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",

                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",

                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",

                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",

                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to <br>rank photo</br>s coming from different photo forums.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to <br>rank photo</br>s from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",

                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to <br>rank photo</br>s, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",

(5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K.

                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",

                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",

                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",

                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other kinds of Web objects including video clips, poems, short stories, music, drawings, sculptures, and so on.",
                "Current system is far from being perfect.",
                "In order to make this system more effective, more delicate analysis for the vertical domain (e.g., Web photo forums) are needed.",
                "The following points, for example, may improve the searching results and will be our future work: 1. more subtle analysis and then utilization of different kinds of ratings (e.g., novelty ratings, aesthetic ratings); 2. differentiating various communities who may have different interests and preferences or even distinct culture understandings; 3. incorporating more useful information, including photographers and reviewers information, to model the photos in a heterogeneous data space instead of the current homogeneous one.",
                "We will further utilize collaborative filtering to recommend relevant high-quality photos to browsers.",
                "One open problem is whether we can find an objective and efficient criterion for evaluating the ranking results, instead of employing subjective and inefficient user studies, which blocked us from trying more ranking algorithms and tuning parameters in one algorithm. 5.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",

                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",

                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",

                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",

                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",

                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",

                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",

(5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K.

                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",

                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",

                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient <br>duplicate photo detection algorithm</br> [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we carry out our research on high-quality photo search.",
                "We first briefly introduce the newly proposed vertical image search engine - EnjoyPhoto in section 3.1.",
                "Then we focus on how to rank photos from different Web forums.",
                "In order to do so, we first normalize the scores (ratings) for photos from different multiple Web forums in section 3.2.",
                "Then we try to find duplicate photos in section 3.3.",
                "Some intermediate results are discussed using δ measure in section 3.4.",
                "Finally a set of user studies is carried out carefully to justify our proposed method in section 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: high-quality Photo Search Engine In order to meet user requirement of enjoying high-quality photos, we propose and build a high-quality photo search engine - EnjoyPhoto, which accounts for the following three key issues: 1. how to crawl and index photos, 2. how to determine the qualities of each photo and 3. how to display the search results in order to make the search process enjoyable.",
                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",
                "As for Issue 3, we devise the interface of the system deliberately in order to smooth the users process of enjoying high-quality photos.",

                "The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million.",
                "After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings.",
                "All these metadata are generally precise descriptions or annotations for the image content, which are then indexed by general text-based search technologies [9, 18, 11].",

                "The reason of these eccentric distributions for Web-D and Web-F lies in their coarse rating systems.",
                "In fact, Web-D and Web-F use 2 or 3 point rating scales whereas other Web forums use 7 or 14 point rating scales.",
                "Therefore, it will be problematic if we directly use these averaged scores.",
                "Furthermore the average score is very likely to be spammed, if there are only a few users rating a photo.",

                "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning <br>algorithm</br> for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",

                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",

                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",

                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our <br>algorithm</br>.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking <br>algorithm</br> can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "<br>algorithm</br> 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection <br>algorithm</br> [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed <br>algorithm</br> will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection <br>algorithm</br>, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This <br>algorithm</br> uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",

(5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",

                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",

                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",

                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",

                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",

                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",

(5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K.

                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",

                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",

                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",

                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the <br>ranking function</br> - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal <br>ranking function</br>. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal <br>ranking function</br>, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-<br>ranking function</br> to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this <br>ranking function</br>, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This <br>ranking function</br> first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",

(5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K.

                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",

                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",

                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",

                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",

                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",

(5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",

                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",

                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",

                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",
                "We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods.",
                "We will specifically focus on <br>web object</br>-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",

                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of <br>web object</br>-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each <br>web object</br>.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith <br>web object</br> (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",

                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], <br>image search</br> [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",

                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to <br>image search</br> engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",

                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in <br>image search</br>, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of <br>image search</br> queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current <br>image search</br> engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial <br>image search</br> engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an <br>image search</br> engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better <br>image search</br> engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical <br>image search</br> engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional <br>image search</br> engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",

                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",

                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",

                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "The reason of these eccentric distributions for Web-D and Web-F lies in their coarse rating systems.",
                "In fact, Web-D and Web-F use 2 or 3 point rating scales whereas other Web forums use 7 or 14 point rating scales.",

                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",

                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",

                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to <br>rank</br> objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",

                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal <br>rank</br> to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to <br>rank</br> photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to <br>rank</br> other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to <br>rank</br> Web objects from different Web sites.",

                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",

                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",

                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to <br>rank</br> photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",

                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the <br>rank</br> results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a <br>rank</br> aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several <br>rank</br> lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K <br>rank</br> lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of <br>rank</br> fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to <br>rank</br>.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",
