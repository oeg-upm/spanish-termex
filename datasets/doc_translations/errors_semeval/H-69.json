In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a vertical search engine. More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation. We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible. The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums. Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described. Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.

INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries. As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want. There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g. Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g. Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3]. We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow. Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors. This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities. Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked. For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data. Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences). This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities. However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains. High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions. For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers. Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships. This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos. Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums. Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search. Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively. We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships. Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12]. We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods. We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation. In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images. However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24]. This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search. On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content. To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine. The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories. Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds. However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem. Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality. For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity. However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image. Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future. Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos. Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine. In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos. In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers. These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results. More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos. The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem. Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums. In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums. Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum. However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine. To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums. That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums. We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization. The main contributions of this paper are: 1. We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2. We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research. In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm. Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4. It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2. ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom. The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object. For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales. It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem. The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums. That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums. Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation. Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums. This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity. In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos. The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations. Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed. Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work). Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums. Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space. This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences. By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem. For convenience, the following notations are employed. Ski and Â¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively. The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores. Suppose there are a total of K Web sites. We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites. In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites. The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration. Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {Ïˆk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i S1k i âˆ’ Ïˆk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i. Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum. The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight Â¯wk i should be. In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one. But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results. Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea. The Web Community 1 is the reference community. The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same. The proposed algorithm will try to find the best Ïˆk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models. So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines. We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work. Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large. In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums. Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5. Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods. In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings. This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums. It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval. We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score. The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed. Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity. The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums. The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores. The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers. To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method. Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score. And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score. This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent. The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums. Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum. We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community. Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters. This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski. Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki. For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune. Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical. It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums. This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code). Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n). The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids. Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built. The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system. Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise. Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space. Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids. The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs. Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of Ïˆk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum. More strictly, we assume Ïˆk has the following form Ïˆk(Ski) = Î±kSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by Î±k relative to the center tk 1âˆ’Î±k as shown in Figure 3. Then, if we substitute above Ïˆk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {Î±k,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î±kSk1 i âˆ’ tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: â€ž Î±k tk Â« = Aâˆ’1 k Lk (6) where Ak = â€ž P i Â¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i Â¯wiSk1 iP i Â¯wiSk1 i P i Â¯wi Â« (7) Lk = â€ž P i Â¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i Â¯wiS1k i Â« (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method. It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments. Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged. As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged. This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results. Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints. First, we introduce a transform: Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) = ( xâˆ’c0 c1âˆ’c0 Î± (c1 âˆ’ c0) + c0, if x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x otherwise where Î± > 0. This transform satisfies that for x âˆˆ [c0, c1], Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) âˆˆ [c0, c1] with Î·c0,c1,Î±(c0) = c0 and Î·c0,c1,Î±(c1) = c1. Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], Ïˆk(Ski) = Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method. We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment. Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {Î±k|kâˆˆ[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one. Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile). This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one. However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively. The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion. Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links. After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums? Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent? We therefore define the following performance measureÎ´ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as Î´kl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) âˆ’ Sim(Slk âˆ— , Skl âˆ— ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl âˆ— = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a Â· b ||a||||b|| . Î´kl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect. On the contrary, if Î´kl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent. Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1. Here, we discuss some other related works. The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists. However, there are fundamental differences between them. First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall. Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1). In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query. Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases. Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12]. All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model. In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank. Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3. EXPERIMENTS In this section, we carry out our research on high-quality photo search. We first briefly introduce the newly proposed vertical image search engine - EnjoyPhoto in section 3.1. Then we focus on how to rank photos from different Web forums. In order to do so, we first normalize the scores (ratings) for photos from different multiple Web forums in section 3.2. Then we try to find duplicate photos in section 3.3. Some intermediate results are discussed using Î´ measure in section 3.4. Finally a set of user studies is carried out carefully to justify our proposed method in section 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: high-quality Photo Search Engine In order to meet user requirement of enjoying high-quality photos, we propose and build a high-quality photo search engine - EnjoyPhoto, which accounts for the following three key issues: 1. how to crawl and index photos, 2. how to determine the qualities of each photo and 3. how to display the search results in order to make the search process enjoyable. For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3). As for Issue 3, we devise the interface of the system deliberately in order to smooth the users process of enjoying high-quality photos. Techniques, such as Fisheye and slides show, are utilized in current system. Figure 5 shows the interface. We will not talk more about this issue as it is not an emphasis of this paper. Figure 5: EnjoyPhoto: an enjoyable high-quality photo search engine, where 26,477 records are returned for the query fall in about 0.421 seconds As for Issue 1, we extracted from a commercial search engine a subset of photos coming from various photo forums all over the world, and explicitly parsed the Web pages containing these photos. The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million. After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings. All these metadata are generally precise descriptions or annotations for the image content, which are then indexed by general text-based search technologies [9, 18, 11]. In current system, the ranking function was specifically tuned to emphasize title, categorization, and rating information. Issue 2 is essentially dealt with in the following sections which derive the quality of photos by analyzing ratings provided by various Web photo forums. Here we chose six photo forums to study the ranking problem and denote them as Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E and Web-F. 3.2 Photo Score Normalization Detailed analysis of different score normalization methods are analyzed in this section. In this analysis, the zero 1 Digital cameras save JPEG (.jpg) files with EXIF (Exchangeable Image File) data. Camera settings and scene information are recorded by the camera into the image file. www.digicamhelp.com/what-is-exif/ 382 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Normalized Score TotalNumber (a) Web-A 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (b) Web-B 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 5 Normalized Score TotalNumber (c) Web-C 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (d) Web-D 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 Normalized Score TotalNumber (e) Web-E 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (f) Web-F Figure 6: Distributions of mean scores normalized to [0, 10] scores that usually occupy about than 30% of the total number of photos for some Web forums are not currently taken into account. How to utilize these photos is left for future explorations. In Figure 6, we list the distributions of the mean score, which is transformed to a fixed interval [0, 10]. The distributions of the average scores of these Web forums look quite different. Distributions in Figure 6(a), 6(b), and 6(e) looks like Gaussian distributions, while those in Figure 6(d) and 6(f) are dominated by the top score. The reason of these eccentric distributions for Web-D and Web-F lies in their coarse rating systems. In fact, Web-D and Web-F use 2 or 3 point rating scales whereas other Web forums use 7 or 14 point rating scales. Therefore, it will be problematic if we directly use these averaged scores. Furthermore the average score is very likely to be spammed, if there are only a few users rating a photo. Figure 7 shows the total score normalization method by maximal and minimal scores, which is one of our base line system. All the total scores of a given Web forum are normalized to [0, 100] according to the maximal score and minimal score of corresponding Web forum. We notice that total score distribution of Web-A in Figure 7(a) has two larger tails than all the others. To show the shape of the distributions more clearly, we only show the distributions on [0, 25] in Figure 7(b),7(c),7(d),7(e), and 7(f). Figure 8 shows the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method, where the modes of the six distributions are normalized to 5 and the 90% percentile to 8. We can see that this normalization method makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent. The two proposed algorithms are all based on these normalization methods. 3.3 Duplicate photo detection Targeting at computational efficiency, the Dedup algorithm may lose some recall rate, but can achieve a high precision rate. We also focus on finding precise hidden links rather than all hidden links. Figure 9 shows some duplicate detection examples. The results are shown in Table 1 and verify that large numbers of duplicate photos exist in any two Web forums even with the strict condition for Dedup where we chose first 29 bits as the hash code. Since there are only a few parameters to estimate in the proposed fusion methods, the numbers of duplicate photos shown Table 1 are 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Normalized Score TotalNumber (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 5 Normalized Score TotalNumber (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Normalized Score TotalNumber (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (f) Web-F Figure 7: Maxmin Normalization 0 5 10 15 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Normalized Score TotalNumber (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Normalized Score TotalNumber (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Normalized Score TotalNumber (f) Web-F Figure 8: Mode-90% Percentile Normalization sufficient to determine these parameters. The last table column lists the total number of photos in the corresponding Web forums. 3.4 Î´ Measure The parameters of the proposed linear and nonlinear algorithms are calculated using the duplicate data shown in Table 1, where the Web-C is chosen as the reference Web forum since it shares the most duplicate photos with other forums. Table 2 and 3 show the Î´ measure on the linear model and nonlinear model. As Î´kl is symmetric and Î´kk = 0, we only show the upper triangular part. The NaN values in both tables lie in that no duplicate photos have been detected by the Dedup algorithm as reported in Table 1. The linear model guarantees that the Î´ measures related Table 1: Number of duplicate photos between each pair of Web forums A B C D E F Scale A 0 316 1,386 178 302 0 130k B 316 0 14,708 909 8,023 348 675k C 1,386 14,708 0 1,508 19,271 1,083 1,003k D 178 909 1,508 0 1,084 21 155k E 302 8,023 19,271 1,084 0 98 448k F 0 348 1,083 21 98 0 122k 383 Figure 9: Some results of duplicate photo detection Table 2: Î´ measure on the linear model.

It is indeed the case (see the underlined numbers in Table 2). But this model can not guarantee that the Î´ measures on the non-reference communities can also be no less than 0, as the normalization steps are based on duplicate photos between the reference community and a nonreference community. Results shows that all the numbers in the Î´ measure are greater than 0 (see all the non-underlined numbers in Table 2), which indicates that it is probable that this model will give optimal results. On the contrary, the nonlinear model does not guarantee that Î´ measures related to the reference community should be no less than 0, as not all duplicate photos between the two Web forums can be used when optimizing this model. In fact, the duplicate photos that lie in different intervals will not be used in this model. It is these specific duplicate photos that make the Î´ measure negative. As a result, there are both negative and positive items in Table 3, but overall the number of positive ones are greater than negative ones (9:5), that indicates the model may be better than the normalization only method (see next subsection) which has an all-zero Î´ measure, and worse than the linear model. 3.5 User Study Because it is hard to find an objective criterion to evaluate Table 3: Î´ measure on the nonlinear model.

Ten subjects were invited to participate in the user study. They were recruited from nearby universities. As search engines of both text search and image search are familiar to university students, there was no prerequisite criterion for choosing students. We conducted user studies using Internet Explorer 6.0 on Windows XP with 17-inch LCD monitors set at 1,280 pixels by 1,024 pixels in 32-bit color. Data was recorded with server logs and paper-based surveys after each task. Figure 10: User study interface We specifically device an interface for user study as shown in Figure 10. For each pair of fusion methods, participants were encouraged to try any query they wished. For those without specific ideas, two combo boxes (category list and query list) were listed on the bottom panel, where the top 1,000 image search queries from a commercial search engine were provided. After a participant submitted a query, the system randomly selected the left or right frame to display each of the two ranking results. The participant were then required to judge which ranking result was better of the two ranking results, or whether the two ranking results were of equal quality, and submit the judgment by choosing the corresponding radio button and clicking the Submit button. For example, in Figure 10, query sunset is submitted to the system. Then, 79,092 photos were returned and ranked by the Minmax fusion method in the left frame and linear fusion method in the right frame. A participant then compares the two ranking results (without knowing the ranking methods) and submits his/her feedback by choosing answers in the Your option. Table 4: Results of user study Norm.Only Manually Linear Linear 29:13:10 14:22:15Nonlinear 29:15:9 12:27:12 6:4:45 Table 4 shows the experimental results, where Linear denotes the linear fusion method, Nonlinear denotes the non linear fusion method, Norm. Only means Maxmin normalization method, Manually means the manually tuned method. The three numbers in each item, say 29:13:10, mean that 29 judgments prefer the linear fusion results, 10 384 judgments prefer the normalization only method, and 13 judgments consider these two methods as equivalent. We conduct the ANOVA analysis, and obtain the following conclusions: 1. Both the linear and nonlinear methods are significantly better than the Norm. Only method with respective P-values 0.00165(< 0.05) and 0.00073(<< 0.05). This result is consistent with the Î´-measure evaluation result. The Norm. Only method assumes that the top 10% photos in different forums are of the same quality. However, this assumption does not stand in general. For example, a top 10% photo in a top tier photo forum is generally of higher quality than a top 10% photo in a second-tier photo forum. This is similar to that, those top 10% students in a top-tier university and those in a second-tier university are generally of different quality. Both linear and nonlinear fusion methods acknowledge the existence of such differences and aim at quantizing the differences. Therefore, they perform better than the Norm. Only method. 2. The linear fusion method is significantly better than the nonlinear one with P-value 1.195 Ã— 10âˆ’10 . This result is rather surprising as this more complicated ranking method is expected to tune the ranking more finely than the linear one. The main reason for this result may be that it is difficult to find the best intervals where the nonlinear tuning should be carried out and yet simply the middle part of the Mode-90% Percentile Normalization method was chosen. The timeconsuming and subjective evaluation methods - user studies - blocked us extensively tuning these parameters. 3. The proposed linear and nonlinear methods perform almost the same with or slightly better than the manually tuned method. Given that the linear/nonlinear fusion methods are fully automatic approaches, they are considered practical and efficient solutions when more communities (e.g. dozens of communities) need to be integrated. 4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we studied the Web object-ranking problem in the cases of lacking object relationships where traditional ranking algorithms are no longer valid, and took high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation. We have built a vertical high-quality photo search engine, and proposed score fusion methods which can automatically integrate as many data sources (Web forums) as possible. The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by duplicate photo detection algorithm, and minimize score differences of duplicate photos in different forums. Both the intermediate results and the user studies show that the proposed fusion methods are a practical and efficient solution to Web object ranking in the aforesaid relationships. Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other kinds of Web objects including video clips, poems, short stories, music, drawings, sculptures, and so on. Current system is far from being perfect. In order to make this system more effective, more delicate analysis for the vertical domain (e.g., Web photo forums) are needed. The following points, for example, may improve the searching results and will be our future work: 1. more subtle analysis and then utilization of different kinds of ratings (e.g., novelty ratings, aesthetic ratings); 2. differentiating various communities who may have different interests and preferences or even distinct culture understandings; 3. incorporating more useful information, including photographers and reviewers information, to model the photos in a heterogeneous data space instead of the current homogeneous one. We will further utilize collaborative filtering to recommend relevant high-quality photos to browsers. One open problem is whether we can find an objective and efficient criterion for evaluating the ranking results, instead of employing subjective and inefficient user studies, which blocked us from trying more ranking algorithms and tuning parameters in one algorithm. 5.

En este documento, estudiamos el problema de rango de objetos web, uno de los problemas clave en la construcciÃ³n de un motor de bÃºsqueda vertical. MÃ¡s especÃ­ficamente, nos centramos en este problema en los casos en que los objetos carecen de relaciones entre diferentes comunidades web y tomamos una bÃºsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como el lecho de prueba para esta investigaciÃ³n. Propusimos dos mÃ©todos de fusiÃ³n de puntaje que pueden integrar automÃ¡ticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con la informaciÃ³n de calificaciÃ³n como sea posible. Los mÃ©todos de fusiÃ³n propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un algoritmo de detecciÃ³n de fotos duplicados, y tiene como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntaje de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuarios muestran que los mÃ©todos de fusiÃ³n propuestos son soluciones prÃ¡cticas y eficientes para la clasificaciÃ³n de objetos web en los casos que hemos descrito. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificaciÃ³n de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos tambiÃ©n son aplicables a otros problemas de clasificaciÃ³n, como la clasificaciÃ³n de pelÃ­culas y la clasificaciÃ³n de mÃºsica.

IntroducciÃ³n A pesar de los numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de bÃºsqueda de propÃ³sito general aÃºn no encuentran resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la bÃºsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento especÃ­fico del dominio y es mÃ¡s efectivo para conectar a los usuarios con la informaciÃ³n que desean. Hay muchos motores de bÃºsqueda vertical, incluidos algunos para la bÃºsqueda en papel (p. Libra [21], CitaSeer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), BÃºsqueda de productos (p. Froogle [5]), bÃºsqueda de pelÃ­culas [6], bÃºsqueda de imÃ¡genes [1, 8], bÃºsqueda de video [6], bÃºsqueda local [2], asÃ­ como bÃºsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia del motor de bÃºsqueda vertical continuarÃ¡ creciendo. Esencialmente, la construcciÃ³n de motores de bÃºsqueda vertical incluye rastreo de datos, extracciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n, identificaciÃ³n e integraciÃ³n de objetos, y recuperaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n web a nivel de objeto (o clasificaciÃ³n de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificaciÃ³n es uno de los factores mÃ¡s importantes. Esto se debe a que se ocupa del problema central de cÃ³mo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de mÃºltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificaciÃ³n a nivel de objeto ha sido bien estudiada en la construcciÃ³n de motores de bÃºsqueda verticales, todavÃ­a hay algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden clasificarse de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, los algoritmos que evolucionaron de PageRank [22], Poprank [21] y Linkfusion [27] se propusieron a objetos de clasificaciÃ³n provenientes de mÃºltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grÃ¡ficos bien definidos de datos heterogÃ©neos. Bien definido significa que los objetos (por ejemplo, los autores en la bÃºsqueda en papel) pueden identificarse en mÃºltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que los objetos heterogÃ©neos estÃ©n bien vinculados para formar un grÃ¡fico al aprovechar todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, por escrito y publicado) entre las mÃºltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposiciÃ³n no siempre representa algunos dominios. La bÃºsqueda de fotos de alta calidad, la bÃºsqueda de pelÃ­culas y la bÃºsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de Fotograk Forum 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, diferentes foros de fotos parecen carecer de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto hace que sea difÃ­cil juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o dos fotos son fotos idÃ©nticas. En consecuencia, aunque cada foto tiene una partitura de calificaciÃ³n en un foro, no es trivial para clasificar fotos provenientes de diferentes foros de fotos. TambiÃ©n existen problemas similares en la bÃºsqueda de pelÃ­culas y la bÃºsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos tÃ­tulos de pelÃ­culas pueden identificarse como el mismo por tÃ­tulo y director en diferentes grupos de discusiÃ³n de pelÃ­culas, no es trivial combinar puntajes de calificaciÃ³n de diferentes grupos de discusiÃ³n y clasificar las pelÃ­culas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tal relaciÃ³n de objetos no triviales en la que la identificaciÃ³n es relaciones difÃ­ciles e incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregaciÃ³n de rango para la web [13, 14] y el algoritmo de aprendizaje para el rango, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. Contrastaremos las diferencias de estos mÃ©todos con los mÃ©todos propuestos despuÃ©s de haber descrito el problema y nuestros mÃ©todos. Nos centraremos especÃ­ficamente en el problema de rango de objetos web en los casos que carecen de relaciones de objetos o tendremos con relaciones de objetos incompletas, y tomarÃ¡n bÃºsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como el lecho de prueba para esta investigaciÃ³n. A continuaciÃ³n, introduciremos una justificaciÃ³n para construir una bÃºsqueda de fotos de alta calidad.1.1 BÃºsqueda de fotos de alta calidad En los Ãºltimos diez aÃ±os, Internet se ha convertido en un recurso increÃ­ble, lo que permite a los usuarios acceder fÃ¡cilmente a una gran cantidad de imÃ¡genes. Sin embargo, en comparaciÃ³n con los mÃ¡s de mil millones de imÃ¡genes indexadas por motores de bÃºsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de bÃºsqueda de imÃ¡genes son relativamente menores y ocupan solo el 8-10 por ciento de las consultas totales de imagen y texto enviadas a motores de bÃºsqueda comerciales [24]. Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos del usuario para la bÃºsqueda de imÃ¡genes son mucho menores que los de la bÃºsqueda general de texto. Por otro lado, los motores de bÃºsqueda comerciales actuales aÃºn no pueden cumplir con los requisitos de varios usuarios, ya que no existe una soluciÃ³n efectiva y prÃ¡ctica para comprender el contenido de la imagen. Para comprender mejor las necesidades del usuario en la bÃºsqueda de imÃ¡genes, realizamos un anÃ¡lisis de registro de consultas basado en un motor de bÃºsqueda comercial. El resultado muestra que mÃ¡s del 20% de las consultas de bÃºsqueda de imÃ¡genes estÃ¡n relacionadas con la naturaleza y los lugares y las categorÃ­as de vida diaria. Aparentemente, los usuarios estÃ¡n interesados en disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad o buscar hermosas imÃ¡genes de ubicaciones u otros tipos. Sin embargo, tales necesidades del usuario no estÃ¡n bien respaldadas por los motores de bÃºsqueda de imÃ¡genes actuales debido a la dificultad del problema de evaluaciÃ³n de calidad. Idealmente, la parte mÃ¡s crÃ­tica de un motor de bÃºsqueda, la funciÃ³n de clasificaciÃ³n, puede simplificarse como que consta de dos factores clave: relevancia y calidad. Para el factor de relevancia, la bÃºsqueda en los motores de bÃºsqueda de imÃ¡genes comerciales actuales proporciona la mayorÃ­a de las imÃ¡genes devueltas que son bastante relevantes para las consultas, excepto por cierta ambigÃ¼edad. Sin embargo, en cuanto al factor de calidad, todavÃ­a no hay forma de dar un rango Ã³ptimo a una imagen. Aunque la evaluaciÃ³n de calidad de imagen basada en el contenido se ha investigado durante muchos aÃ±os [23, 25, 26], aÃºn estÃ¡ lejos de estar listo para proporcionar una medida de calidad realista en el futuro inmediato. Aparentemente, realmente parece pesimista construir un motor de bÃºsqueda de imÃ¡genes que pueda cumplir con el requisito potencialmente grande de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Sin embargo, varias comunidades web en proliferaciÃ³n nos nota que las personas de hoy han creado y compartido muchas fotos de alta calidad en la web sobre prÃ¡cticamente cualquier temas, que proporcionan una rica fuente para construir un mejor motor de bÃºsqueda de imÃ¡genes. En general, las fotos de varios foros de fotos son de mayor calidad que las fotos personales, y tambiÃ©n son mucho mÃ¡s atractivas para los usuarios pÃºblicos que las fotos personales. AdemÃ¡s, las fotos cargadas en foros de fotos generalmente requieren metadatos ricos sobre el tÃ­tulo, la configuraciÃ³n de la cÃ¡mara, la categorÃ­a y la descripciÃ³n que los fotÃ³grafos proporcionarÃ¡n. Estos metadatos son en realidad las descripciones mÃ¡s precisas para las fotos y, sin duda, se pueden indexar para ayudar a los motores de bÃºsqueda a encontrar resultados relevantes. MÃ¡s importante, hay usuarios voluntarios en las comunidades web que ofrecen activamente calificaciones valiosas para estas fotos. La informaciÃ³n de calificaciÃ³n es generalmente de gran valor para resolver el problema de clasificaciÃ³n de calidad de la foto. Motivado por tales observaciones, hemos estado tratando de construir un motor de bÃºsqueda de fotos vertical extrayendo metadatos ricos e integrando informaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n sobre varios foros web de fotos. En este documento, nos centramos especÃ­ficamente en cÃ³mo clasificar las fotos de mÃºltiples foros web. Intuitivamente, los puntajes de calificaciÃ³n de diferentes foros de fotos se pueden normalizar empÃ­ricamente en funciÃ³n del nÃºmero de fotos y la cantidad de usuarios en cada foro. Sin embargo, un enfoque tan sencillo generalmente requiere un gran esfuerzo manual tanto en la ajuste de los parÃ¡metros tediosos como en la evaluaciÃ³n de resultados subjetivos, lo que lo hace poco prÃ¡ctico cuando hay decenas o cientos de foros de fotos para combinar. Para abordar este problema, buscamos construir relaciones/enlaces entre diferentes foros de fotos. Es decir, primero adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar fotos duplicadas que puedan considerarse como enlaces ocultos que conectan mÃºltiples foros. Luego formulamos el desafÃ­o de clasificaciÃ³n como un problema de optimizaciÃ³n, lo que eventualmente resulta en una funciÃ³n de clasificaciÃ³n Ã³ptima.1.2 Contribuciones y organizaciÃ³n principales. Las principales contribuciones de este documento son: 1. Hemos propuesto y creado un motor de bÃºsqueda de imÃ¡genes vertical aprovechando metadatos ricos de varios sitios web del foro de fotos para cumplir con los requisitos de los usuarios para buscar y disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, que es imposible en los motores de bÃºsqueda de imÃ¡genes tradicionales.2. Hemos propuesto dos tipos de algoritmos de rango de objetos web para fotos con relaciones incompletas, que pueden integrar de manera automÃ¡tica y eficiente tantas comunidades web posibles con informaciÃ³n de calificaciÃ³n y logra un resultado cualitativo igual en comparaciÃ³n con el esquema de fusiÃ³n sintonizado manualmente. El resto de este documento estÃ¡ organizado de la siguiente manera. En la SecciÃ³n 2, presentamos en detalle las soluciones propuestas al problema de clasificaciÃ³n, incluida cÃ³mo encontrar enlaces ocultos entre diferentes foros, normalizar las puntuaciones de calificaciÃ³n, obtener la funciÃ³n de clasificaciÃ³n Ã³ptima y contrastar nuestros mÃ©todos con algunas otras investigaciones relacionadas. En la SecciÃ³n 3, describimos el entorno experimental y los experimentos y los estudios de usuarios realizados para evaluar nuestro algoritmo. Nuestra conclusiÃ³n y una discusiÃ³n sobre el trabajo futuro es en la SecciÃ³n 4. Vale la pena seÃ±alar que, aunque tratamos la bÃºsqueda de fotos verticales como el lecho de prueba en este documento, el algoritmo de clasificaciÃ³n propuesto tambiÃ©n se puede aplicar para clasificar otro contenido que incluye videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, dibujos, esculturas, mÃºsica, etc..378 2. Algoritmo 2.1 DescripciÃ³n general La dificultad de integrar mÃºltiples foros web estÃ¡ en sus diferentes sistemas de calificaciÃ³n, donde generalmente hay dos tipos de libertad. El primer tipo de libertad es el intervalo de calificaciÃ³n o la escala de calificaciÃ³n que incluye las calificaciones mÃ­nimas y mÃ¡ximas para cada objeto web. Por ejemplo, algunos foros usan una escala de calificaciÃ³n de 5 puntos, mientras que otros foros usan escalas de calificaciÃ³n de 3 puntos o 10 puntos. Parece fÃ¡cil arreglar esta libertad, pero el anÃ¡lisis detallado de los datos y los experimentos muestran que es un problema no trivial. El segundo tipo de libertad son los criterios de calificaciÃ³n variables que se encuentran en diferentes foros web. Es decir, el mismo puntaje no significa la misma calidad en diferentes foros. Intuitivamente, si podemos detectar los mismos fotÃ³grafos o las mismas fotografÃ­as, podemos construir relaciones entre dos foros de fotos y, por lo tanto, podemos estandarizar el criterio de calificaciÃ³n mediante normalizaciÃ³n y transformaciÃ³n de puntaje. Afortunadamente, encontramos que existen una gran cantidad de fotografÃ­as duplicadas en varios foros de fotos web. Este hecho es razonable al considerar que los fotÃ³grafos a veces envÃ­an una foto a mÃ¡s de un foro para obtener crÃ­ticas o con la esperanza de una publicidad generalizada. En este trabajo, adoptamos un algoritmo de detecciÃ³n de fotos duplicados eficientes [10] para encontrar estas fotos. Los mÃ©todos propuestos a continuaciÃ³n se basan en las siguientes consideraciones. Frente a la necesidad de superar un problema de clasificaciÃ³n, se necesita un criterio de calificaciÃ³n estandarizado en lugar de un criterio de calificaciÃ³n razonable. Por lo tanto, podemos tomar un foro a gran escala como foro de referencia y alinear otros foros teniendo en cuenta los objetos web duplicados (fotos duplicadas en este trabajo). Idealmente, las decenas de fotos duplicadas deben ser iguales a pesar de que estÃ¡n en diferentes foros. Sin embargo, podemos considerar que las puntuaciones en diferentes forales sean de Forumcept para el foro de referencia: puede variar en un espacio paramÃ©trico. Esto se puede determinar minimizando la funciÃ³n objetivo definida por la suma de los cuadrados de las diferencias de puntaje. Al formular el problema de clasificaciÃ³n como un problema de optimizaciÃ³n que intenta hacer las decenas de fotos duplicadas en los foros de no referencia lo mÃ¡s cerca posible para aquellos en el foro de referencia, podemos resolver efectivamente el problema de clasificaciÃ³n. Por conveniencia, se emplean las siguientes anotaciones. Ski y Â¯ski denotan el puntaje total y la puntuaciÃ³n media del objeto web (foto) en el sitio web de KTH, respectivamente. El puntaje total se refiere a la suma de los diversos puntajes de calificaciÃ³n (por ejemplo, calificaciÃ³n de novedad y calificaciÃ³n estÃ©tica), y la puntuaciÃ³n media se refiere a la media de los diversos puntajes de calificaciÃ³n. Supongamos que hay un total de K sitios web. Usamos aÃºn mÃ¡s {skl i | i = 1, ..., ikl;k, l = 1, ..., k;K = L} para denotar el conjunto de puntajes para objetos web (fotos) en los foros web de KTH que estÃ¡n duplicados con los foros web de LTH, donde IKL es el nÃºmero total de objetos web duplicados entre estos dos sitios web. En general, la fusiÃ³n de puntaje puede verse como el procedimiento de encontrar k transformaciones Ïˆk (ski) = eski, k = 1, ..., k tal que ESKI puede usarse para clasificar objetos web de diferentes sitios web. La funciÃ³n objetivo descrita en la Figura 1 anterior: IntegraciÃ³n de la comunidad web. Cada comunidad web forma una subgraph, y todas las comunidades estÃ¡n vinculadas juntas por algunos enlaces ocultos (lÃ­neas discontinuas).El pÃ¡rrafo se puede formular como min {Ïˆk | k = 2, ..., k} kx k = 2 ik1x i = 1 Â¯wk i s1k i - Ïˆk (sk1 i) 2 (1) donde usamos k = 1 comoel foro de referencia y, por lo tanto, Ïˆ1 (s1i) = s1i.Â¯wk I (â‰¥ 0) es el coeficiente de peso que se puede establecer heurÃ­sticamente de acuerdo con el nÃºmero de votantes (revisores o comentaristas) tanto en el foro de referencia como en el foro de no referencia. Cuantos mÃ¡s revisores, mÃ¡s popular sea la foto y mÃ¡s grande es el peso correspondiente Â¯wk, deberÃ­a ser. En este trabajo, no inspeccionamos el problema de cÃ³mo elegir Â¯wk I y simplemente establecerlos en uno. Pero creemos que el uso adecuado de Â¯wk I, que aprovecha mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n, puede mejorar significativamente los resultados. La Figura 1 ilustra la idea antes mencionada. La comunidad web 1 es la comunidad de referencia. Las lÃ­neas discontinuas son enlaces que indican que los dos objetos web vinculados son en realidad los mismos. El algoritmo propuesto intentarÃ¡ encontrar el mejor Ïˆk (k = 2, ..., k), que tiene ciertas formas paramÃ©tricas de acuerdo con ciertos modelos. Para minimizar la funciÃ³n de costo definida en la ecuaciÃ³n.1, la suma se toma en todas las lÃ­neas discontinuas rojas. Primero discutiremos los mÃ©todos de normalizaciÃ³n de puntaje en la SecciÃ³n 2.2, que sirve como base para el siguiente trabajo. Antes de describir los algoritmos de clasificaciÃ³n propuestos, primero presentamos un mÃ©todo manualmente sintonizado en la SecciÃ³n 2.3, que es laborioso e incluso poco prÃ¡ctico cuando el nÃºmero de comunidades se vuelve grande. En la SecciÃ³n 2.4, explicaremos brevemente cÃ³mo encontrar con precisiÃ³n las fotos duplicadas entre los foros web. Luego describiremos los dos mÃ©todos propuestos: fusiÃ³n lineal y fusiÃ³n no lineal, y una medida de rendimiento para la evaluaciÃ³n de resultados en la SecciÃ³n 2.5. Finalmente, en la SecciÃ³n 2.6 discutiremos la relaciÃ³n de los mÃ©todos propuestos con algÃºn otro trabajo relacionado.2.2 NormalizaciÃ³n de puntaje Dado que los foros web (foto) en la web generalmente tienen diferentes criterios de calificaciÃ³n, es necesario normalizarlos antes de aplicar diferentes tipos de mÃ©todos de fusiÃ³n. AdemÃ¡s, como hay muchos tipos de calificaciones, como las calificaciones para la novedad, las clasificaciones para la estÃ©tica, etc., es razonable elegir una puntuaciÃ³n total comÃºn o un puntaje promedio siempre se puede extraer en cualquier foro web o calculado por las calificaciones correspondientes. Esto permite que el mÃ©todo de Normaliza379 en la puntuaciÃ³n total o el puntaje promedio se ve como un mÃ©todo de calificaciÃ³n imparcial entre diferentes foros web. Es sencillo normalizar los puntajes promedio transformÃ¡ndolos linealmente en un intervalo fijo. Llamamos a este tipo de puntaje como puntaje promedio escalado. Sin embargo, la dificultad de usar este mÃ©todo de normalizaciÃ³n es que, si solo hay unos pocos usuarios que califican un objeto, digamos una foto en un foro de fotos, es probable que el puntaje promedio para el objeto sea spam o sesgado. El puntaje total puede evitar tales inconvenientes que contienen mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n, como una calidad y popularidad de los objetos web. El problema es, por lo tanto, cÃ³mo normalizar los puntajes totales en diferentes foros web. La forma mÃ¡s simple puede ser la normalizaciÃ³n por las puntuaciones mÃ¡ximas y mÃ­nimas. El inconveniente de este mÃ©todo de normalizaciÃ³n es que no es robusto, o en otras palabras, es sensible a los valores atÃ­picos. Para que la normalizaciÃ³n sea insensible a los datos inusuales, proponemos el mÃ©todo de normalizaciÃ³n del percentil del 90%. AquÃ­, el puntaje de modo representa el puntaje total que se ha asignado a mÃ¡s fotos que cualquier otra puntuaciÃ³n total. Y el puntaje de percentil alto (por ejemplo, 90%) representa el puntaje total para el cual el percentil alto de imÃ¡genes tiene una puntuaciÃ³n total mÃ¡s baja. Este mÃ©todo de normalizaciÃ³n utiliza el modo y el percentil del 90% como dos puntos de referencia para alinear dos sistemas de calificaciÃ³n, lo que hace que las distribuciones de puntajes totales en diferentes foros sean mÃ¡s consistentes. La suposiciÃ³n subyacente, por ejemplo, en diferentes foros de fotos, es que incluso las cualidades de las mejores fotos en diferentes foros pueden variar mucho y depender menos de la calidad del foro, la distribuciÃ³n de fotos de calidad de nivel medio (desde el modo hasta el 90% percentil) Debe ser casi de la misma calidad hasta la libertad que refleja el criterio de calificaciÃ³n (estricto) de los foros web. Las fotos de este nivel medio en un foro web generalmente ocupan mÃ¡s del 70 % del total de fotos en ese foro. Daremos un anÃ¡lisis mÃ¡s detallado de los puntajes en la SecciÃ³n 3.2.2.3 FusiÃ³n manual El foro de pelÃ­culas web, IMDB [16], propuesta para usar una funciÃ³n de rango bayesiano para normalizar los puntajes de calificaciÃ³n dentro de una comunidad. Motivado por esta funciÃ³n de clasificaciÃ³n, proponemos este mÃ©todo de fusiÃ³n manual: para el sitio web de KTH, usamos la siguiente fÃ³rmula eski = Î±k Â· â€žnk Â· Â¯ski nk + n âˆ— k + n âˆ— k Â· s âˆ— k nk + n âˆ—K Â«(2) para clasificar las fotos, donde nk es el nÃºmero de votos y n âˆ— k, s âˆ— k y Î±k son tres parÃ¡metros. Esta funciÃ³n de clasificaciÃ³n primero toma un equilibrio entre la puntuaciÃ³n media original Â¯ski y una puntuaciÃ³n de referencia S âˆ— K para obtener una puntuaciÃ³n media ponderada que puede ser mÃ¡s confiable que Â¯ski. Luego, la puntuaciÃ³n media ponderada es escalada por Î±K para obtener la puntuaciÃ³n final FSKI. Para las comunidades web, hay alrededor de 3n parÃ¡metros en {(Î±k, n âˆ— k, s âˆ— k) | k = 1, ..., n} para sintonizar. Aunque este mÃ©todo puede lograr resultados bastante buenos despuÃ©s de un ajuste manual cuidadoso y exhaustivo en estos parÃ¡metros, cuando N se vuelve cada vez mÃ¡s grande, digamos que hay decenas o cientos de comunidades web arrastradas e indexadas, este mÃ©todo se volverÃ¡ cada vez mÃ¡s laborioso y eventualmente se volverÃ¡ poco prÃ¡ctico.. Por lo tanto, es deseable encontrar un mÃ©todo de fusiÃ³n efectivo cuyos parÃ¡metros se pueden determinar automÃ¡ticamente.2.4 DetecciÃ³n de fotos duplicados Usamos Dedup [10], un algoritmo de detecciÃ³n de imÃ¡genes duplicados eficientes y efectivos, para encontrar fotos duplicadas entre dos foros de fotos. Este algoritmo utiliza la funciÃ³n hash para asignar una caracterÃ­stica dimensional de alta dimensiÃ³n a un cÃ³digo hash de 32 bits (consulte a continuaciÃ³n cÃ³mo construir el cÃ³digo hash). Su complejidad computacional para encontrar todas las imÃ¡genes duplicadas entre n imÃ¡genes es sobre O (n log n). La caracterÃ­stica visual de bajo nivel para cada foto se extrae en cuadrÃ­culas regulares K Ã— K. SegÃºn todas las caracterÃ­sticas extraÃ­das de la base de datos de imÃ¡genes, se crea un modelo PCA. Las caracterÃ­sticas visuales se transforman en un espacio PCA medio de dimensiÃ³n relativamente baja y cero, o 29 dimensiones en nuestro sistema. Luego, el cÃ³digo hash para cada foto se construye de la siguiente manera: cada dimensiÃ³n se transforma en una, si el valor en esta dimensiÃ³n es mayor que 0 y 0 de lo contrario. Las fotos en el mismo cubo se consideran duplicados potenciales y se filtran aÃºn mÃ¡s por un umbral en tÃ©rminos de similitud euclidiana en el espacio de caracterÃ­sticas visuales. La Figura 2 ilustra el procedimiento de hash, donde las caracterÃ­sticas visuales, los valores medios de grises, se extraen en cuadrÃ­culas 6 Ã— 6 y 7 Ã— 7. Las caracterÃ­sticas de 85 dimensiones se transforman en un vector de 32 dimensiones, y el cÃ³digo hash se genera de acuerdo con los signos. Figura 2: Procedimiento de hash para la fusiÃ³n de puntaje duplicada de la fotografÃ­a 2.5 En esta secciÃ³n, presentaremos dos soluciones en la fusiÃ³n de puntaje basadas en diferentes supuestos de forma paramÃ©trica de Ïˆk en la ecuaciÃ³n.1. 2.5.1 FusiÃ³n lineal por fotos duplicadas de manera intuitiva, la forma mÃ¡s directa de factorizar las incertidumbres causadas por el criterio diferente es escalar, relajado a un centro determinado, las puntuaciones totales de cada foro de fotos web no referenciado con respecto alForo de referencia. MÃ¡s estrictamente, suponemos que Ïˆk tiene la siguiente forma Ïˆk (ski) = Î±kski + tk, k = 2, ..., k (3) Ïˆ1 (s1i) = s1i (4), lo que significa que las puntuaciones de k (= 1) El foro debe ser escalado por Î±K en relaciÃ³n con el centro TK 1 - Î±k como se muestra en la Figura 3. Entonces, si sustituimos arriba Ïˆk a la ecuaciÃ³n.1, obtenemos la siguiente funciÃ³n objetivo, min {Î±k, tk | k = 2, ..., k} kx k = 2 ik1x i = 1 Â¯wk i h s1k i - Î±ksk1 i - tk i2.(5) Al resolver el siguiente conjunto de funciones, (âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0, k = 1, ..., k donde f es la funciÃ³n objetivo definida en la ecuaciÃ³n 5, obtenemos elsoluciÃ³n de forma cerrada como: â€žÎ±k tkÂ« = a - 1 k lk (6) donde ak = â€žp i Â¯wi (sk1 i) 2 p i Â¯wisk1 ip i Â¯wisk1 i p i Â¯wiÂ« (7) lk =â€žP I Â¯wis1k I Sk1 IP I Â¯wis1k IÂ« (8) y k = 2, ..., K. Este es un mÃ©todo de fusiÃ³n lineal. Disfruta de simplicidad y excelente rendimiento en los siguientes experimentos. Figura 3: MÃ©todo de fusiÃ³n lineal 2.5.2 FusiÃ³n no lineal por fotos duplicadas A veces queremos un mÃ©todo que pueda ajustar las puntuaciones en los intervalos con dos puntos finales sin cambios. Como se ilustra en la Figura 4, el mÃ©todo puede ajustar las puntuaciones entre [C0, C1] mientras deja los puntajes C0 y C1 sin cambios. Este tipo de mÃ©todo de fusiÃ³n es mucho mÃ¡s fino que el lineal y contiene muchos mÃ¡s parÃ¡metros para sintonizar y esperar mejorar aÃºn mÃ¡s los resultados. AquÃ­, proponemos una soluciÃ³n de fusiÃ³n no lineal para satisfacer tales restricciones. Primero, introducimos una transformaciÃ³n: Î·c0, c1, Î± (x) = (x - c0 c1 - c0 Î± (c1 - c0) + c0, si x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x de lo contrario donde Î±> 0. Esta transformaciÃ³n satisface que para x âˆˆ [C0, C1], Î·c0, C1, Î± (x) âˆˆ [C0, C1] con Î·c0, C1, Î± (C0) = C0 y Î·c0, C1, Î± (C1) = C1. Luego podemos utilizar esta transformaciÃ³n no lineal para ajustar las puntuaciones en cierto intervalo, digamos (m, t], Ïˆk (ski) = Î·m, t, Î± (ski). (9) Figura 4: mÃ©todo de fusiÃ³n no lineal. Intentamos ajustar finamente la forma de las curvas en cada segmento. Incluso no hay una soluciÃ³n de forma cerrada para el siguiente problema de optimizaciÃ³n, min {Î±k | kâˆˆ [2, k]} kx k = 2 ik1x i = 1 Â¯wk i h s1k i-Î·m, t, Î± (ski) i2 it it it it itNo es difÃ­cil obtener el numÃ©rico. Bajo los mismos supuestos realizados en la SecciÃ³n 2.2, podemos usar este mÃ©todo para ajustar las puntuaciones del nivel medio (desde el punto de modo hasta el percentil del 90 %). Se espera que este mÃ©todo de fusiÃ³n no lineal mÃ¡s complicado alcance mejores resultados que el lineal. Sin embargo, las dificultades para evaluar los resultados de rango nos impiden ajustar estos parÃ¡metros ampliamente. Los experimentos actuales en la SecciÃ³n 3.5 no revelan ninguna ventaja sobre el modelo lineal simple.2.5.3 Medida de rendimiento de los resultados de la fusiÃ³n Dado que nuestra funciÃ³n objetivo es hacer las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web (por ejemplo, fotos duplicadas) entre un foro de no referencia y el foro de referencia lo mÃ¡s cerca posible, es natural investigar quÃ© tan cerca estÃ¡nel uno al otro y cÃ³mo los puntajes de los mismos objetos web cambian entre los dos foros no referentes antes y despuÃ©s de la fusiÃ³n de puntaje. Tomada en la Figura 1 como ejemplo, los algoritmos propuestos minimizan las diferencias de puntaje de los mismos objetos web en dos foros web: el foro de referencia (la comunidad web 1) y un foro de no referencia, que corresponde a minimizar la funciÃ³n de objetivo en el rojoenlaces discontinuos (ocultos). DespuÃ©s de la optimizaciÃ³n, debemos preguntarnos quÃ© sucede con las diferencias de puntaje de los mismos objetos web en dos foros de no referencia. Â¿O, en otras palabras, si las puntuaciones de dos objetos vinculados por los enlaces discontinuos (ocultos) se vuelven mÃ¡s consistentes? Por lo tanto, definimos la siguiente medida de medida de rendimiento, para cuantificar los cambios para las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web en diferentes foros web que Î”Kl = SIM (SLK, SKL) - SIM (SLK âˆ—, SKL âˆ—) (10) 381 donde skl = (((Skl 1, ..., skl ikl) t, skl âˆ— = (eskl 1, ..., eskl ikl) t y sim (a, b) = a Â· b || a |||| b ||.Î”Kl> 0 significa despuÃ©s de la fusiÃ³n de puntaje, los puntajes en los mismos objetos web entre el foro web KTH y LTH se vuelven mÃ¡s consistentes, que es lo que esperamos. Por el contrario, si Î”Kl <0, esos puntajes se vuelven mÃ¡s inconsistentes. Aunque no podemos confiar en esta medida para evaluar nuestros resultados finales de fusiÃ³n, ya que la clasificaciÃ³n de fotos por su popularidad y cualidades es un proceso tan subjetivo que cada persona puede tener sus propios resultados, puede ayudarnos a comprender los resultados de clasificaciÃ³n intermedia y proporcionar informaciÃ³n sobre la finalactuaciones de diferentes mÃ©todos de clasificaciÃ³n.2.6 Contrasts con otro trabajo relacionado ya hemos mencionado las diferencias de los mÃ©todos propuestos con los mÃ©todos tradicionales, como los algoritmos PageRank [22], Poprank [21] y Linkfusion [27] en la SecciÃ³n 1. AquÃ­, discutimos algunas otras obras relacionadas. El problema actual tambiÃ©n se puede ver como una agregaciÃ³n de rango una [13, 14] mientras abordamos el problema de cÃ³mo combinar varias listas de rango. Sin embargo, existen diferencias fundamentales entre ellos. En primer lugar, a diferencia de las pÃ¡ginas web, que se pueden detectar de manera fÃ¡cil y precisa como las mismas pÃ¡ginas, detectar las mismas fotos en diferentes foros web es un trabajo no trivial, y solo puede ser implementado por algunos algoritmos delicados, mientras que con cierta precisiÃ³n yrecordar. En segundo lugar, los nÃºmeros de las fotos duplicadas de diferentes foros web son pequeÃ±os en relaciÃ³n con los conjuntos de fotos completos (ver Tabla 1). En otras palabras, las listas de rango K Top K de diferentes foros web estÃ¡n casi desarticulados para una consulta dada. Bajo esta condiciÃ³n, tanto los algoritmos propuestos en [13] como en sus mediciones, la distancia de Kendall Tau o la distancia del fÃºtbol de Spearman, degenerarÃ¡ a algunos casos triviales. Otra categorÃ­a de mÃ©todos de fusiÃ³n de rango (agregaciÃ³n) se basa en algoritmos de aprendizaje automÃ¡tico, como RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15] y RankNet [12]. Todos estos mÃ©todos implican algunos conjuntos de datos etiquetados para entrenar un modelo. En los entornos actuales, es difÃ­cil o incluso imposible obtener estos conjuntos de datos etiquetados en cuanto a su nivel de profesionalismo o popularidad, ya que las fotos son demasiado vagas y subjetivas para el rango. En cambio, el problema aquÃ­ es cÃ³mo combinar varias subconscidades ordenadas para formar una lista de pedidos totales.3. Experimentos En esta secciÃ³n, realizamos nuestra investigaciÃ³n sobre la bÃºsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. Primero presentamos brevemente el motor de bÃºsqueda de imÃ¡genes vertical recientemente propuesto: disfrutar de la secciÃ³n 3.1. Luego nos centramos en cÃ³mo clasificar las fotos de diferentes foros web. Para hacerlo, primero normalizamos los puntajes (calificaciones) para fotos de diferentes foros web mÃºltiples en la SecciÃ³n 3.2. Luego intentamos encontrar fotos duplicadas en la SecciÃ³n 3.3. Algunos resultados intermedios se discuten utilizando la medida Î´ en la SecciÃ³n 3.4. Finalmente, un conjunto de estudios de usuarios se lleva a cabo cuidadosamente para justificar nuestro mÃ©todo propuesto en la SecciÃ³n 3.5.3.1 Disfrutar de: motor de bÃºsqueda de fotos de alta calidad Para cumplir con los requisitos del usuario de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, proponemos y construimos un motor de bÃºsqueda de fotos de alta calidad: disfrutar Photo, que representa los siguientes tres problemas clave: 1. CÃ³mo arrastrary fotos de Ã­ndice, 2. CÃ³mo determinar las cualidades de cada foto y 3. CÃ³mo mostrar los resultados de bÃºsqueda para que el proceso de bÃºsqueda sea agradable. Para una consulta basada en texto dada, este sistema clasifica las fotos basadas en cierta combinaciÃ³n de relevancia de la foto a esta consulta (nÃºmero 1) y la calidad de la foto (nÃºmero 2), y finalmente las muestra de manera agradable (nÃºmero 3). En cuanto al nÃºmero 3, diseÃ±amos la interfaz del sistema deliberadamente para suavizar el proceso de usuarios de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Las tÃ©cnicas, como Fisheye y Slides muestran, se utilizan en el sistema actual. La Figura 5 muestra la interfaz. No hablaremos mÃ¡s sobre este tema, ya que no es un Ã©nfasis de este documento. Figura 5: disfrutar de: un motor de bÃºsqueda de fotos de alta calidad agradable, donde se devuelven 26,477 registros para que la consulta caiga en aproximadamente 0.421 segundos en cuanto al nÃºmero 1, extraemos de un motor de bÃºsqueda comercial un subconjunto de fotos que provienen de varios foros de fotos en todas partes.el mundo, y analizÃ³ explÃ­citamente las pÃ¡ginas web que contienen estas fotos. El nÃºmero de fotos en la recopilaciÃ³n de datos es de aproximadamente 2.5 millones. DespuÃ©s del anÃ¡lisis, cada foto se asociÃ³ con su tÃ­tulo, categorÃ­a, descripciÃ³n, configuraciÃ³n de la cÃ¡mara, datos exif 1 (cuando estÃ¡ disponible para imÃ¡genes digitales), ubicaciÃ³n (cuando estuviera disponible en algunos foros de fotos) y muchos tipos de calificaciones. Todos estos metadatos son generalmente descripciones o anotaciones precisas para el contenido de la imagen, que luego son indexados por tecnologÃ­as de bÃºsqueda generales basadas en texto [9, 18, 11]. En el sistema actual, la funciÃ³n de clasificaciÃ³n se sintonizÃ³ especÃ­ficamente para enfatizar la informaciÃ³n del tÃ­tulo, la categorizaciÃ³n y la calificaciÃ³n. El nÃºmero 2 se trata esencialmente en las siguientes secciones que derivan la calidad de las fotos analizando las calificaciones proporcionadas por varios foros de fotos web. AquÃ­ elegimos seis foros de fotos para estudiar el problema de clasificaciÃ³n y denotarlos como Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E y Web-F.3.2 Photo Score NormalizaciÃ³n El anÃ¡lisis detallado de diferentes mÃ©todos de normalizaciÃ³n de puntaje se analizan en esta secciÃ³n. En este anÃ¡lisis, las cÃ¡maras digitales cero 1 guardan archivos JPEG (.jpg) con datos exif (archivo de imagen intercambiable). La cÃ¡mara y la informaciÃ³n de la escena son grabadas por la cÃ¡mara en el archivo de imagen.www.digicamhelp.com/what-is-exif/ 382 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 PuntuaciÃ³n normalizada TotalNumber (a) Web-A 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 normalizadoPuntaje TotalNumber (b) Web-B 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 5 PuntuaciÃ³n normalizada TotalNumber (C) Web-C 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 4 PuntuaciÃ³n normalizada TotalNumber (d) Web-D 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 PuntuaciÃ³n normalizada TotalNumber (E) Web-E 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 x 10 4 PuntuaciÃ³n normalizada TotalNumber (F)Web-F Figura 6: Las distribuciones de puntajes medios normalizados a los puntajes [0, 10] que generalmente ocupan aproximadamente el 30% del nÃºmero total de fotos para algunos foros web no se tienen en cuenta actualmente. CÃ³mo utilizar estas fotos se deja para futuras exploraciones. En la Figura 6, enumeramos las distribuciones de la puntuaciÃ³n media, que se transforma en un intervalo fijo [0, 10]. Las distribuciones de los puntajes promedio de estos foros web se ven bastante diferentes. Las distribuciones en la Figura 6 (a), 6 (b) y 6 (e) se parecen a distribuciones gaussianas, mientras que las de la Figura 6 (d) y 6 (f) estÃ¡n dominadas por la puntuaciÃ³n superior. La razÃ³n de estas distribuciones excÃ©ntricas para Web-D y Web-F se encuentra en sus sistemas de calificaciÃ³n gruesa. De hecho, Web-D y Web-F usan escalas de calificaciÃ³n de 2 o 3 puntos, mientras que otros foros web usan escalas de calificaciÃ³n de 7 o 14 puntos. Por lo tanto, serÃ¡ problemÃ¡tico si usamos directamente estos puntajes promedio. AdemÃ¡s, es muy probable que el puntaje promedio se spam, si solo hay unos pocos usuarios que califican una foto. La Figura 7 muestra el mÃ©todo de normalizaciÃ³n de puntaje total por puntajes mÃ¡ximos y mÃ­nimos, que es uno de nuestro sistema de lÃ­nea base. Todos los puntajes totales de un foro web dado se normalizan a [0, 100] de acuerdo con el puntaje mÃ¡ximo y el puntaje mÃ­nimo del foro web correspondiente. Notamos que la distribuciÃ³n total de puntaje de Web-A en la Figura 7 (a) tiene dos colas mÃ¡s grandes que todas las demÃ¡s. Para mostrar la forma de las distribuciones mÃ¡s claramente, solo mostramos las distribuciones en [0, 25] en la Figura 7 (b), 7 (c), 7 (d), 7 (e) y 7 (f). La Figura 8 muestra el mÃ©todo de normalizaciÃ³n del percentil Mode-90%, donde los modos de las seis distribuciones se normalizan a 5 y el percentil del 90% a 8. Podemos ver que este mÃ©todo de normalizaciÃ³n hace que las distribuciones de puntajes totales en diferentes foros sean mÃ¡s consistentes. Los dos algoritmos propuestos se basan en estos mÃ©todos de normalizaciÃ³n.3.3 DetecciÃ³n de fotos duplicada DirecciÃ³n de eficiencia computacional, el algoritmo DEDUP puede perder alguna tasa de recuperaciÃ³n, pero puede lograr una alta tasa de precisiÃ³n. TambiÃ©n nos centramos en encontrar enlaces ocultos precisos en lugar de todos los enlaces ocultos. La Figura 9 muestra algunos ejemplos de detecciÃ³n duplicados. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 y verifican que existan grandes cantidades de fotos duplicadas en dos foros web, incluso con la condiciÃ³n estricta para DEDUP, donde elegimos los primeros 29 bits como cÃ³digo hash.

La Ãºltima columna de la tabla enumera el nÃºmero total de fotos en los foros web correspondientes.3.4 Î” Medido Los parÃ¡metros de los algoritmos lineales y no lineales propuestos se calculan utilizando los datos duplicados que se muestran en la Tabla 1, donde el Web-C se elige como el foro web de referencia, ya que comparte las fotos mÃ¡s duplicadas con otros foros. La Tabla 2 y 3 muestran la medida Î´ en el modelo lineal y el modelo no lineal. Como Î”Kl es simÃ©trico y Î”KK = 0, solo mostramos la parte triangular superior. Los valores de NAN en ambas tablas se encuentran en que el algoritmo DEDUP ha detectado las fotos duplicadas como se informa en la Tabla 1. El modelo lineal garantiza que las medidas Î” relacionadas con la Tabla 1: NÃºmero de fotos duplicadas entre cada par de foros web a b c d e f escala a 0 316 1,386 178 302 0 130k b 316 0 14,708 909 8,023 348 675K C 1,386 14,708 0 1,508 19,271 1,083 1,003k D178 909 1,508 0 1,084 21 155K E 302 8,023 19,271 1,084 0 98 448K F 0 348 1,083 21 98 0 122K 383 Figura 9: Algunos resultados de Duplicado Tabla de detecciÃ³n de fotos 2: Î´ MediciÃ³n en el modelo lineal.

De hecho, es el caso (ver los nÃºmeros subrayados en la Tabla 2). Pero este modelo no puede garantizar que las medidas Î´ en las comunidades de no referencia tampoco puedan ser menos de 0, ya que los pasos de normalizaciÃ³n se basan en fotos duplicadas entre la comunidad de referencia y una comunidad de no referencia. Los resultados muestran que todos los nÃºmeros en la medida Î´ son mayores que 0 (ver todos los nÃºmeros no subrayados en la Tabla 2), lo que indica que es probable que este modelo dÃ© resultados Ã³ptimos. Por el contrario, el modelo no lineal no garantiza que las medidas de Î´ relacionadas con la comunidad de referencia no sean menos de 0, ya que no todas las fotos duplicadas entre los dos foros web se pueden usar al optimizar este modelo. De hecho, las fotos duplicadas que se encuentran en diferentes intervalos no se utilizarÃ¡n en este modelo. Son estas fotos duplicadas especÃ­ficas las que hacen que la medida Î´ sea negativa. Como resultado, hay elementos negativos y positivos en la Tabla 3, pero en general el nÃºmero de positivos es mayor que los negativos (9: 5), que indica que el modelo puede ser mejor que el mÃ©todo de normalizaciÃ³n solo (ver Next Subsection)que tiene una medida Î´ totalmente cero, y peor que el modelo lineal.3.5 Estudio del usuario porque es difÃ­cil encontrar un criterio objetivo para evaluar la Tabla 3: Medida Î´ en el modelo no lineal.

Diez sujetos fueron invitados a participar en el estudio del usuario. Fueron reclutados de universidades cercanas. Como los motores de bÃºsqueda de la bÃºsqueda de texto y la bÃºsqueda de imÃ¡genes son familiares para los estudiantes universitarios, no hubo un criterio de requisitos previos para elegir a los estudiantes. Realizamos estudios de usuarios con Internet Explorer 6.0 en Windows XP con monitores LCD de 17 pulgadas establecidos en 1,280 pÃ­xeles por 1,024 pÃ­xeles en color de 32 bits. Los datos se registraron con registros de servidores y encuestas en papel despuÃ©s de cada tarea. Figura 10: Interfaz de estudio del usuario especÃ­ficamente que diseÃ±amos una interfaz para el estudio del usuario como se muestra en la Figura 10. Para cada par de mÃ©todos de fusiÃ³n, se alentÃ³ a los participantes a probar cualquier consulta que quisieran. Para aquellos sin ideas especÃ­ficas, se enumeraron dos cuadros combinados (lista de categorÃ­as y lista de consultas) en el panel inferior, donde se proporcionaron las 1,000 consultas de bÃºsqueda de imÃ¡genes principales de un motor de bÃºsqueda comercial. DespuÃ©s de que un participante presentÃ³ una consulta, el sistema seleccionÃ³ aleatoriamente el marco izquierdo o derecho para mostrar cada uno de los dos resultados de clasificaciÃ³n. Luego se requiriÃ³ que el participante juzgara quÃ© resultado de clasificaciÃ³n fue mejor de los dos resultados de clasificaciÃ³n, o si los dos resultados de clasificaciÃ³n fueron de igual calidad, y enviar el juicio eligiendo el botÃ³n de radio correspondiente y haciendo clic en el botÃ³n Enviar. Por ejemplo, en la Figura 10, la puesta de sol de consulta se envÃ­a al sistema. Luego, 79,092 fotos fueron devueltas y clasificadas por el mÃ©todo de fusiÃ³n Minmax en el marco izquierdo y el mÃ©todo de fusiÃ³n lineal en el marco derecho. Luego, un participante compara los dos resultados de clasificaciÃ³n (sin conocer los mÃ©todos de clasificaciÃ³n) y presenta sus comentarios eligiendo respuestas en su opciÃ³n. Tabla 4: Resultados de la norma de estudio del usuario. Solo lineal lineal manual 29:13:10 14: 22: 15 Nonlinear 29: 15: 15 12:27:12 6: 4: 45 La Tabla 4 muestra los resultados experimentales, donde lineal denota linealMÃ©todo de fusiÃ³n, no lineal denota el mÃ©todo de fusiÃ³n no lineal, norma. Solo significa el mÃ©todo de normalizaciÃ³n de maxmin, significa manualmente el mÃ©todo ajustado manualmente. Los tres nÃºmeros en cada elemento, digamos 29:13:10, significan que 29 juicios prefieren los resultados de la fusiÃ³n lineal, 10 384 juicios prefieren el mÃ©todo de normalizaciÃ³n solo y 13 juicios consideran estos dos mÃ©todos como equivalentes. Realizamos el anÃ¡lisis ANOVA y obtenemos las siguientes conclusiones: 1. Los mÃ©todos lineales y no lineales son significativamente mejores que la norma. Solo mÃ©todo con valores p respectivos 0.00165 (<0.05) y 0.00073 (<< 0.05). Este resultado es consistente con el resultado de la evaluaciÃ³n de la medida Î´. La norma. El Ãºnico mÃ©todo supone que las fotos del 10% principales en diferentes foros son de la misma calidad. Sin embargo, esta suposiciÃ³n no se mantiene en general. Por ejemplo, una foto del 10% superior en un foro de fotos de primer nivel es generalmente de mayor calidad que una foto del 10% superior en un foro de fotos de segundo nivel. Esto es similar a eso, esos 10% de los mejores estudiantes en una universidad de primer nivel y los de una universidad de segundo nivel son generalmente de diferente calidad. Los mÃ©todos de fusiÃ³n lineales y no lineales reconocen la existencia de tales diferencias y tienen como objetivo cuantificar las diferencias. Por lo tanto, funcionan mejor que la norma. Solo mÃ©todo.2. El mÃ©todo de fusiÃ³n lineal es significativamente mejor que el no lineal con valor p 1.195 Ã— 10-10. Este resultado es bastante sorprendente, ya que se espera que este mÃ©todo de clasificaciÃ³n mÃ¡s complicado sintonice la clasificaciÃ³n mÃ¡s finamente que la lineal. La razÃ³n principal de este resultado puede ser que es difÃ­cil encontrar los mejores intervalos en los que se debe llevar a cabo el ajuste no lineal y, sin embargo, simplemente se eligiÃ³ la parte media del mÃ©todo de normalizaciÃ³n del percentil MODE-90%. Los mÃ©todos de evaluaciÃ³n subjetivos y subjetivos - Estudios de usuarios - nos bloquearon ampliamente ajustando estos parÃ¡metros.3. Los mÃ©todos lineales y no lineales propuestos funcionan casi igual o ligeramente mejor que el mÃ©todo sintonizado manualmente. Dado que los mÃ©todos de fusiÃ³n lineal/no lineal son enfoques totalmente automÃ¡ticos, se consideran soluciones prÃ¡cticas y eficientes cuando se deben integrar mÃ¡s comunidades (por ejemplo, docenas de comunidades).4. Conclusiones y trabajo futuro En este documento, estudiamos el problema de rango de objetos web en los casos de falta de relaciones de objetos donde los algoritmos de clasificaciÃ³n tradicionales ya no son vÃ¡lidos, y tomamos una bÃºsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como la cama de prueba para esta investigaciÃ³n. Hemos creado un motor de bÃºsqueda de fotos vertical de alta calidad y mÃ©todos de fusiÃ³n de puntaje propuestos que pueden integrar automÃ¡ticamente la mayor cantidad de fuentes de datos (foros web) como sea posible. Los mÃ©todos de fusiÃ³n propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por el algoritmo de detecciÃ³n de fotos duplicados y minimizan las diferencias de puntaje de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuarios muestran que los mÃ©todos de fusiÃ³n propuestos son una soluciÃ³n prÃ¡ctica y eficiente para la clasificaciÃ³n de objetos web en las relaciones antes mencionadas. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificaciÃ³n de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos tambiÃ©n son aplicables a otros tipos de objetos web que incluyen videoclips, poemas, cuentos, mÃºsica, dibujos, esculturas, etc. El sistema actual estÃ¡ lejos de ser perfecto. Para hacer que este sistema sea mÃ¡s efectivo, se necesitan un anÃ¡lisis mÃ¡s delicado para el dominio vertical (por ejemplo, foros de fotos web). Los siguientes puntos, por ejemplo, pueden mejorar los resultados de bÃºsqueda y serÃ¡n nuestro trabajo futuro: 1. AnÃ¡lisis mÃ¡s sutil y luego utilizaciÃ³n de diferentes tipos de calificaciones (por ejemplo, calificaciones de novedad, calificaciones estÃ©ticas);2. Diferenciar a varias comunidades que pueden tener diferentes intereses y preferencias o incluso entendimientos culturales distintos;3. Incorporar informaciÃ³n mÃ¡s Ãºtil, incluida la informaciÃ³n de los fotÃ³grafos y revisores, para modelar las fotos en un espacio de datos heterogÃ©neo en lugar del homogÃ©neo actual. Utilizaremos aÃºn mÃ¡s el filtrado colaborativo para recomendar fotos relevantes de alta calidad a los navegadores. Un problema abierto es si podemos encontrar un criterio objetivo y eficiente para evaluar los resultados de la clasificaciÃ³n, en lugar de emplear estudios de usuarios subjetivos e ineficientes, lo que nos impidiÃ³ probar mÃ¡s algoritmos de clasificaciÃ³n y ajustar los parÃ¡metros en un algoritmo.5.

        "In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a vertical search engine.",
        "More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
        "We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible.",
        "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
        "Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described.",
        "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval; G.2.2 [Discrete Mathematics]: Graph Theory; H.3.5 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Online Information Services - Web-based services General Terms Algorithms, Experimentation 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.",
        "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
        "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
        "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
        "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
        "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
        "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
        "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
        "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
        "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
        "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
        "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
        "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
        "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
        "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
        "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
        "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
        "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",
        "Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.",
        "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",
        "We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.",
        "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",
        "We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods.",
        "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
        "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
        "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
        "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
        "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
        "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
        "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
        "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
        "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
        "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
        "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
        "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
        "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
        "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
        "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
        "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
        "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
        "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
        "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
        "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
        "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
        "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
        "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
        "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
        "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
        "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
        "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
        "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
        "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
        "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
        "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
        "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
        "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
        "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
        "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
        "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
        "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
        "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
        "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
        "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
        "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
        "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
        "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
        "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
        "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
        "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
        "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
        "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
        "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
        "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
        "Ski and Â¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
        "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
        "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
        "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
        "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
        "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
        "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {Ïˆk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i S1k i âˆ’ Ïˆk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i. Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
        "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight Â¯wk i should be.",
        "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
        "But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
        "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
        "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
        "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best Ïˆk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
        "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
        "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
        "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
        "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
        "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
        "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
        "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
        "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
        "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
        "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
        "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
        "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
        "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
        "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
        "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
        "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
        "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
        "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
        "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
        "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
        "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
        "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
        "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
        "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
        "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
        "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
        "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
        "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
        "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
        "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
        "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
        "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
        "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
        "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
        "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids.",
        "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
        "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of Ïˆk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
        "More strictly, we assume Ïˆk has the following form Ïˆk(Ski) = Î±kSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by Î±k relative to the center tk 1âˆ’Î±k as shown in Figure 3.",
        "Then, if we substitute above Ïˆk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {Î±k,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î±kSk1 i âˆ’ tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: â€ž Î±k tk Â« = Aâˆ’1 k Lk (6) where Ak = â€ž P i Â¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i Â¯wiSk1 iP i Â¯wiSk1 i P i Â¯wi Â« (7) Lk = â€ž P i Â¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i Â¯wiS1k i Â« (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
        "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
        "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
        "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
        "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
        "First, we introduce a transform: Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) = ( xâˆ’c0 c1âˆ’c0 Î± (c1 âˆ’ c0) + c0, if x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x otherwise where Î± > 0.",
        "This transform satisfies that for x âˆˆ [c0, c1], Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) âˆˆ [c0, c1] with Î·c0,c1,Î±(c0) = c0 and Î·c0,c1,Î±(c1) = c1.",
        "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], Ïˆk(Ski) = Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
        "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
        "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {Î±k|kâˆˆ[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
        "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
        "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
        "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
        "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
        "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
        "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
        "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
        "We therefore define the following performance measureÎ´ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as Î´kl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) âˆ’ Sim(Slk âˆ— , Skl âˆ— ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl âˆ— = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a Â· b ||a||||b|| . Î´kl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
        "On the contrary, if Î´kl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
        "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
        "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
        "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
        "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
        "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
        "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
        "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
        "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
        "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
        "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
        "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
        "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",
        "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we carry out our research on high-quality photo search.",
        "We first briefly introduce the newly proposed vertical image search engine - EnjoyPhoto in section 3.1.",
        "Then we focus on how to rank photos from different Web forums.",
        "In order to do so, we first normalize the scores (ratings) for photos from different multiple Web forums in section 3.2.",
        "Then we try to find duplicate photos in section 3.3.",
        "Some intermediate results are discussed using Î´ measure in section 3.4.",
        "Finally a set of user studies is carried out carefully to justify our proposed method in section 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: high-quality Photo Search Engine In order to meet user requirement of enjoying high-quality photos, we propose and build a high-quality photo search engine - EnjoyPhoto, which accounts for the following three key issues: 1. how to crawl and index photos, 2. how to determine the qualities of each photo and 3. how to display the search results in order to make the search process enjoyable.",
        "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",
        "As for Issue 3, we devise the interface of the system deliberately in order to smooth the users process of enjoying high-quality photos.",
        "Techniques, such as Fisheye and slides show, are utilized in current system.",
        "Figure 5 shows the interface.",
        "We will not talk more about this issue as it is not an emphasis of this paper.",
        "Figure 5: EnjoyPhoto: an enjoyable high-quality photo search engine, where 26,477 records are returned for the query fall in about 0.421 seconds As for Issue 1, we extracted from a commercial search engine a subset of photos coming from various photo forums all over the world, and explicitly parsed the Web pages containing these photos.",
        "The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million.",
        "After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings.",
        "All these metadata are generally precise descriptions or annotations for the image content, which are then indexed by general text-based search technologies [9, 18, 11].",
        "In current system, the ranking function was specifically tuned to emphasize title, categorization, and rating information.",
        "Issue 2 is essentially dealt with in the following sections which derive the quality of photos by analyzing ratings provided by various Web photo forums.",
        "Here we chose six photo forums to study the ranking problem and denote them as Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E and Web-F. 3.2 Photo Score Normalization Detailed analysis of different score normalization methods are analyzed in this section.",

        "How to utilize these photos is left for future explorations.",
        "In Figure 6, we list the distributions of the mean score, which is transformed to a fixed interval [0, 10].",
        "The distributions of the average scores of these Web forums look quite different.",
        "Distributions in Figure 6(a), 6(b), and 6(e) looks like Gaussian distributions, while those in Figure 6(d) and 6(f) are dominated by the top score.",
        "The reason of these eccentric distributions for Web-D and Web-F lies in their coarse rating systems.",
        "In fact, Web-D and Web-F use 2 or 3 point rating scales whereas other Web forums use 7 or 14 point rating scales.",
        "Therefore, it will be problematic if we directly use these averaged scores.",
        "Furthermore the average score is very likely to be spammed, if there are only a few users rating a photo.",
        "Figure 7 shows the total score normalization method by maximal and minimal scores, which is one of our base line system.",
        "All the total scores of a given Web forum are normalized to [0, 100] according to the maximal score and minimal score of corresponding Web forum.",
        "We notice that total score distribution of Web-A in Figure 7(a) has two larger tails than all the others.",
        "To show the shape of the distributions more clearly, we only show the distributions on [0, 25] in Figure 7(b),7(c),7(d),7(e), and 7(f).",
        "Figure 8 shows the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method, where the modes of the six distributions are normalized to 5 and the 90% percentile to 8.",
        "We can see that this normalization method makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",

        "Current system is far from being perfect.",
        "In order to make this system more effective, more delicate analysis for the vertical domain (e.g., Web photo forums) are needed.",
        "The following points, for example, may improve the searching results and will be our future work: 1. more subtle analysis and then utilization of different kinds of ratings (e.g., novelty ratings, aesthetic ratings); 2. differentiating various communities who may have different interests and preferences or even distinct culture understandings; 3. incorporating more useful information, including photographers and reviewers information, to model the photos in a heterogeneous data space instead of the current homogeneous one.",
        "We will further utilize collaborative filtering to recommend relevant high-quality photos to browsers.",
        "One open problem is whether we can find an objective and efficient criterion for evaluating the ranking results, instead of employing subjective and inefficient user studies, which blocked us from trying more ranking algorithms and tuning parameters in one algorithm. 5.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",

                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",

                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",

Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",

                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",

                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of Ïˆk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume Ïˆk has the following form Ïˆk(Ski) = Î±kSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by Î±k relative to the center tk 1âˆ’Î±k as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above Ïˆk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {Î±k,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î±kSk1 i âˆ’ tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: â€ž Î±k tk Â« = Aâˆ’1 k Lk (6) where Ak = â€ž P i Â¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i Â¯wiSk1 iP i Â¯wiSk1 i P i Â¯wi Â« (7) Lk = â€ž P i Â¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i Â¯wiS1k i Â« (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",

                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) = ( xâˆ’c0 c1âˆ’c0 Î± (c1 âˆ’ c0) + c0, if x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x otherwise where Î± > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x âˆˆ [c0, c1], Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) âˆˆ [c0, c1] with Î·c0,c1,Î±(c0) = c0 and Î·c0,c1,Î±(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], Ïˆk(Ski) = Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {Î±k|kâˆˆ[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureÎ´ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as Î´kl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) âˆ’ Sim(Slk âˆ— , Skl âˆ— ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl âˆ— = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a Â· b ||a||||b|| . Î´kl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if Î´kl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",

                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and Â¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {Ïˆk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i S1k i âˆ’ Ïˆk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i. Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight Â¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best Ïˆk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of Ïˆk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume Ïˆk has the following form Ïˆk(Ski) = Î±kSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by Î±k relative to the center tk 1âˆ’Î±k as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above Ïˆk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {Î±k,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î±kSk1 i âˆ’ tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: â€ž Î±k tk Â« = Aâˆ’1 k Lk (6) where Ak = â€ž P i Â¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i Â¯wiSk1 iP i Â¯wiSk1 i P i Â¯wi Â« (7) Lk = â€ž P i Â¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i Â¯wiS1k i Â« (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) = ( xâˆ’c0 c1âˆ’c0 Î± (c1 âˆ’ c0) + c0, if x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x otherwise where Î± > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x âˆˆ [c0, c1], Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) âˆˆ [c0, c1] with Î·c0,c1,Î±(c0) = c0 and Î·c0,c1,Î±(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], Ïˆk(Ski) = Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {Î±k|kâˆˆ[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureÎ´ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as Î´kl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) âˆ’ Sim(Slk âˆ— , Skl âˆ— ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl âˆ— = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a Â· b ||a||||b|| . Î´kl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if Î´kl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we carry out our research on high-quality photo search.",

                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",

                "The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million.",
                "After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings.",

                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",

                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",

                "We will specifically focus on <br>web object-ranking</br> problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of <br>web object-ranking</br> algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and Â¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {Ïˆk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i S1k i âˆ’ Ïˆk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i. Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight Â¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best Ïˆk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of Ïˆk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume Ïˆk has the following form Ïˆk(Ski) = Î±kSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by Î±k relative to the center tk 1âˆ’Î±k as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above Ïˆk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {Î±k,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î±kSk1 i âˆ’ tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: â€ž Î±k tk Â« = Aâˆ’1 k Lk (6) where Ak = â€ž P i Â¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i Â¯wiSk1 iP i Â¯wiSk1 i P i Â¯wi Â« (7) Lk = â€ž P i Â¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i Â¯wiS1k i Â« (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) = ( xâˆ’c0 c1âˆ’c0 Î± (c1 âˆ’ c0) + c0, if x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x otherwise where Î± > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x âˆˆ [c0, c1], Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) âˆˆ [c0, c1] with Î·c0,c1,Î±(c0) = c0 and Î·c0,c1,Î±(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], Ïˆk(Ski) = Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {Î±k|kâˆˆ[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureÎ´ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as Î´kl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) âˆ’ Sim(Slk âˆ— , Skl âˆ— ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl âˆ— = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a Â· b ||a||||b|| . Î´kl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if Î´kl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",

                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",

                "The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million.",
                "After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings.",

                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and Â¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {Ïˆk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i S1k i âˆ’ Ïˆk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i. Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight Â¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best Ïˆk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids.",

                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",

                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",

                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building <br>high-quality photo search</br>. 1.1 <br>high-quality photo search</br> In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and Â¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {Ïˆk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i S1k i âˆ’ Ïˆk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i. Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight Â¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best Ïˆk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of Ïˆk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume Ïˆk has the following form Ïˆk(Ski) = Î±kSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by Î±k relative to the center tk 1âˆ’Î±k as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above Ïˆk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {Î±k,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î±kSk1 i âˆ’ tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: â€ž Î±k tk Â« = Aâˆ’1 k Lk (6) where Ak = â€ž P i Â¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i Â¯wiSk1 iP i Â¯wiSk1 i P i Â¯wi Â« (7) Lk = â€ž P i Â¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i Â¯wiS1k i Â« (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) = ( xâˆ’c0 c1âˆ’c0 Î± (c1 âˆ’ c0) + c0, if x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x otherwise where Î± > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x âˆˆ [c0, c1], Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) âˆˆ [c0, c1] with Î·c0,c1,Î±(c0) = c0 and Î·c0,c1,Î±(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], Ïˆk(Ski) = Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {Î±k|kâˆˆ[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureÎ´ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as Î´kl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) âˆ’ Sim(Slk âˆ— , Skl âˆ— ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl âˆ— = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a Â· b ||a||||b|| . Î´kl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if Î´kl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we carry out our research on <br>high-quality photo search</br>.",
                "We first briefly introduce the newly proposed vertical image search engine - EnjoyPhoto in section 3.1.",
                "Then we focus on how to rank photos from different Web forums.",
                "In order to do so, we first normalize the scores (ratings) for photos from different multiple Web forums in section 3.2.",

                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",

                "The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million.",
                "After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings.",

                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",

                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and Â¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {Ïˆk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i S1k i âˆ’ Ïˆk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i. Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight Â¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best Ïˆk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of Ïˆk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume Ïˆk has the following form Ïˆk(Ski) = Î±kSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by Î±k relative to the center tk 1âˆ’Î±k as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above Ïˆk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {Î±k,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î±kSk1 i âˆ’ tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: â€ž Î±k tk Â« = Aâˆ’1 k Lk (6) where Ak = â€ž P i Â¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i Â¯wiSk1 iP i Â¯wiSk1 i P i Â¯wi Â« (7) Lk = â€ž P i Â¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i Â¯wiS1k i Â« (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) = ( xâˆ’c0 c1âˆ’c0 Î± (c1 âˆ’ c0) + c0, if x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x otherwise where Î± > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x âˆˆ [c0, c1], Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) âˆˆ [c0, c1] with Î·c0,c1,Î±(c0) = c0 and Î·c0,c1,Î±(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], Ïˆk(Ski) = Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {Î±k|kâˆˆ[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureÎ´ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as Î´kl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) âˆ’ Sim(Slk âˆ— , Skl âˆ— ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl âˆ— = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a Â· b ||a||||b|| . Î´kl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if Î´kl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",

                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to <br>rank photo</br>s from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and Â¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {Ïˆk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i S1k i âˆ’ Ïˆk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i. Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight Â¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best Ïˆk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to <br>rank photo</br>s, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of Ïˆk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume Ïˆk has the following form Ïˆk(Ski) = Î±kSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by Î±k relative to the center tk 1âˆ’Î±k as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above Ïˆk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {Î±k,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î±kSk1 i âˆ’ tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: â€ž Î±k tk Â« = Aâˆ’1 k Lk (6) where Ak = â€ž P i Â¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i Â¯wiSk1 iP i Â¯wiSk1 i P i Â¯wi Â« (7) Lk = â€ž P i Â¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i Â¯wiS1k i Â« (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) = ( xâˆ’c0 c1âˆ’c0 Î± (c1 âˆ’ c0) + c0, if x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x otherwise where Î± > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x âˆˆ [c0, c1], Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) âˆˆ [c0, c1] with Î·c0,c1,Î±(c0) = c0 and Î·c0,c1,Î±(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], Ïˆk(Ski) = Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {Î±k|kâˆˆ[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureÎ´ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as Î´kl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) âˆ’ Sim(Slk âˆ— , Skl âˆ— ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl âˆ— = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a Â· b ||a||||b|| . Î´kl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if Î´kl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",

                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",

                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "Finally a set of user studies is carried out carefully to justify our proposed method in section 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: high-quality Photo Search Engine In order to meet user requirement of enjoying high-quality photos, we propose and build a high-quality photo search engine - EnjoyPhoto, which accounts for the following three key issues: 1. how to crawl and index photos, 2. how to determine the qualities of each photo and 3. how to display the search results in order to make the search process enjoyable.",
                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",

                "The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million.",
                "After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings.",
                "All these metadata are generally precise descriptions or annotations for the image content, which are then indexed by general text-based search technologies [9, 18, 11].",
                "In current system, the ranking function was specifically tuned to emphasize title, categorization, and rating information.",

                "The reason of these eccentric distributions for Web-D and Web-F lies in their coarse rating systems.",
                "In fact, Web-D and Web-F use 2 or 3 point rating scales whereas other Web forums use 7 or 14 point rating scales.",
                "Therefore, it will be problematic if we directly use these averaged scores.",
                "Furthermore the average score is very likely to be spammed, if there are only a few users rating a photo.",

                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and Â¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {Ïˆk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i S1k i âˆ’ Ïˆk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i. Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight Â¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best Ïˆk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",

                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",

                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",

                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",

                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
                "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient <br>duplicate photo detection algorithm</br> [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and Â¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {Ïˆk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i S1k i âˆ’ Ïˆk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i. Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight Â¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best Ïˆk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of Ïˆk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume Ïˆk has the following form Ïˆk(Ski) = Î±kSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by Î±k relative to the center tk 1âˆ’Î±k as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above Ïˆk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {Î±k,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î±kSk1 i âˆ’ tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: â€ž Î±k tk Â« = Aâˆ’1 k Lk (6) where Ak = â€ž P i Â¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i Â¯wiSk1 iP i Â¯wiSk1 i P i Â¯wi Â« (7) Lk = â€ž P i Â¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i Â¯wiS1k i Â« (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) = ( xâˆ’c0 c1âˆ’c0 Î± (c1 âˆ’ c0) + c0, if x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x otherwise where Î± > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x âˆˆ [c0, c1], Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) âˆˆ [c0, c1] with Î·c0,c1,Î±(c0) = c0 and Î·c0,c1,Î±(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], Ïˆk(Ski) = Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {Î±k|kâˆˆ[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureÎ´ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as Î´kl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) âˆ’ Sim(Slk âˆ— , Skl âˆ— ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl âˆ— = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a Â· b ||a||||b|| . Î´kl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if Î´kl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we carry out our research on high-quality photo search.",
                "We first briefly introduce the newly proposed vertical image search engine - EnjoyPhoto in section 3.1.",

                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",

                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",

                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient <br>algorithm</br> to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our <br>algorithm</br>.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking <br>algorithm</br> can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "<br>algorithm</br> 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",

                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",

                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection <br>algorithm</br>, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",

                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids.",

                "Then, if we substitute above Ïˆk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {Î±k,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î±kSk1 i âˆ’ tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: â€ž Î±k tk Â« = Aâˆ’1 k Lk (6) where Ak = â€ž P i Â¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i Â¯wiSk1 iP i Â¯wiSk1 i P i Â¯wi Â« (7) Lk = â€ž P i Â¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i Â¯wiS1k i Â« (8) and k = 2, ..., K.

                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) = ( xâˆ’c0 c1âˆ’c0 Î± (c1 âˆ’ c0) + c0, if x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x otherwise where Î± > 0.",

                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",

                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureÎ´ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as Î´kl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) âˆ’ Sim(Slk âˆ— , Skl âˆ— ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl âˆ— = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a Â· b ||a||||b|| . Î´kl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if Î´kl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",

                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",

                "In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a vertical search engine.",
                "More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible.",
                "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
                "Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described.",
                "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval; G.2.2 [Discrete Mathematics]: Graph Theory; H.3.5 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Online Information Services - Web-based services General Terms Algorithms, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.",
                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
                "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",
                "Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.",
                "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",
                "We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.",
                "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",
                "We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods.",
                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and Â¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {Ïˆk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i S1k i âˆ’ Ïˆk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i. Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight Â¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best Ïˆk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of Ïˆk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume Ïˆk has the following form Ïˆk(Ski) = Î±kSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by Î±k relative to the center tk 1âˆ’Î±k as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above Ïˆk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {Î±k,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î±kSk1 i âˆ’ tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: â€ž Î±k tk Â« = Aâˆ’1 k Lk (6) where Ak = â€ž P i Â¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i Â¯wiSk1 iP i Â¯wiSk1 i P i Â¯wi Â« (7) Lk = â€ž P i Â¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i Â¯wiS1k i Â« (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) = ( xâˆ’c0 c1âˆ’c0 Î± (c1 âˆ’ c0) + c0, if x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x otherwise where Î± > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x âˆˆ [c0, c1], Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) âˆˆ [c0, c1] with Î·c0,c1,Î±(c0) = c0 and Î·c0,c1,Î±(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], Ïˆk(Ski) = Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: <br>nonlinear fusion method</br>.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {Î±k|kâˆˆ[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",

                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureÎ´ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as Î´kl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) âˆ’ Sim(Slk âˆ— , Skl âˆ— ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl âˆ— = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a Â· b ||a||||b|| . Î´kl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",

                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "We first briefly introduce the newly proposed vertical image search engine - EnjoyPhoto in section 3.1.",
                "Then we focus on how to rank photos from different Web forums.",
                "In order to do so, we first normalize the scores (ratings) for photos from different multiple Web forums in section 3.2.",
                "Then we try to find duplicate photos in section 3.3.",
                "Some intermediate results are discussed using Î´ measure in section 3.4.",
                "Finally a set of user studies is carried out carefully to justify our proposed method in section 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: high-quality Photo Search Engine In order to meet user requirement of enjoying high-quality photos, we propose and build a high-quality photo search engine - EnjoyPhoto, which accounts for the following three key issues: 1. how to crawl and index photos, 2. how to determine the qualities of each photo and 3. how to display the search results in order to make the search process enjoyable.",
                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",

                "The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million.",
                "After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings.",
                "All these metadata are generally precise descriptions or annotations for the image content, which are then indexed by general text-based search technologies [9, 18, 11].",
                "In current system, the ranking function was specifically tuned to emphasize title, categorization, and rating information.",

                "The reason of these eccentric distributions for Web-D and Web-F lies in their coarse rating systems.",
                "In fact, Web-D and Web-F use 2 or 3 point rating scales whereas other Web forums use 7 or 14 point rating scales.",
                "Therefore, it will be problematic if we directly use these averaged scores.",

                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the <br>ranking function</br> - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal <br>ranking function</br>. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal <br>ranking function</br>, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and Â¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {Ïˆk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i S1k i âˆ’ Ïˆk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i. Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight Â¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best Ïˆk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-<br>ranking function</br> to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this <br>ranking function</br>, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This <br>ranking function</br> first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",

                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",

                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",

                "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by duplicate photo detection algorithm, and minimize score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
                "Both the intermediate results and the user studies show that the proposed fusion methods are a practical and efficient solution to Web object ranking in the aforesaid relationships.",
                "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other kinds of Web objects including video clips, poems, short stories, music, drawings, sculptures, and so on.",
                "Current system is far from being perfect.",
                "In order to make this system more effective, more delicate analysis for the vertical domain (e.g., Web photo forums) are needed.",
                "The following points, for example, may improve the searching results and will be our future work: 1. more subtle analysis and then utilization of different kinds of ratings (e.g., novelty ratings, aesthetic ratings); 2. differentiating various communities who may have different interests and preferences or even distinct culture understandings; 3. incorporating more useful information, including photographers and reviewers information, to model the photos in a heterogeneous data space instead of the current homogeneous one.",
                "We will further utilize collaborative filtering to recommend relevant high-quality photos to browsers.",
                "One open problem is whether we can find an objective and efficient criterion for evaluating the ranking results, instead of employing subjective and inefficient user studies, which blocked us from trying more ranking algorithms and tuning parameters in one algorithm. 5.",

                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",

                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",

                "Ski and Â¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",

                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {Ïˆk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i S1k i âˆ’ Ïˆk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i. Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight Â¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",

                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",

                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of Ïˆk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume Ïˆk has the following form Ïˆk(Ski) = Î±kSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by Î±k relative to the center tk 1âˆ’Î±k as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above Ïˆk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {Î±k,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î±kSk1 i âˆ’ tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: â€ž Î±k tk Â« = Aâˆ’1 k Lk (6) where Ak = â€ž P i Â¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i Â¯wiSk1 iP i Â¯wiSk1 i P i Â¯wi Â« (7) Lk = â€ž P i Â¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i Â¯wiS1k i Â« (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) = ( xâˆ’c0 c1âˆ’c0 Î± (c1 âˆ’ c0) + c0, if x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x otherwise where Î± > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x âˆˆ [c0, c1], Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) âˆˆ [c0, c1] with Î·c0,c1,Î±(c0) = c0 and Î·c0,c1,Î±(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], Ïˆk(Ski) = Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {Î±k|kâˆˆ[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureÎ´ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as Î´kl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) âˆ’ Sim(Slk âˆ— , Skl âˆ— ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl âˆ— = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a Â· b ||a||||b|| . Î´kl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if Î´kl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of <br>web object</br>-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each <br>web object</br>.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and Â¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith <br>web object</br> (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {Ïˆk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i S1k i âˆ’ Ïˆk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i. Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight Â¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best Ïˆk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of Ïˆk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume Ïˆk has the following form Ïˆk(Ski) = Î±kSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by Î±k relative to the center tk 1âˆ’Î±k as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above Ïˆk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {Î±k,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î±kSk1 i âˆ’ tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: â€ž Î±k tk Â« = Aâˆ’1 k Lk (6) where Ak = â€ž P i Â¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i Â¯wiSk1 iP i Â¯wiSk1 i P i Â¯wi Â« (7) Lk = â€ž P i Â¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i Â¯wiS1k i Â« (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) = ( xâˆ’c0 c1âˆ’c0 Î± (c1 âˆ’ c0) + c0, if x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x otherwise where Î± > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x âˆˆ [c0, c1], Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) âˆˆ [c0, c1] with Î·c0,c1,Î±(c0) = c0 and Î·c0,c1,Î±(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], Ïˆk(Ski) = Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {Î±k|kâˆˆ[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureÎ´ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as Î´kl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) âˆ’ Sim(Slk âˆ— , Skl âˆ— ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl âˆ— = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a Â· b ||a||||b|| . Î´kl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if Î´kl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a vertical search engine.",
                "More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible.",
                "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
                "Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described.",
                "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval; G.2.2 [Discrete Mathematics]: Graph Theory; H.3.5 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Online Information Services - Web-based services General Terms Algorithms, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.",
                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], <br>image search</br> [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
                "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",
                "Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.",
                "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",
                "We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.",
                "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",
                "We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods.",
                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to <br>image search</br> engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for <br>image search</br> are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in <br>image search</br>, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of <br>image search</br> queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current <br>image search</br> engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial <br>image search</br> engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an <br>image search</br> engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better <br>image search</br> engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical <br>image search</br> engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional <br>image search</br> engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and Â¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {Ïˆk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i S1k i âˆ’ Ïˆk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i. Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight Â¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best Ïˆk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of Ïˆk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume Ïˆk has the following form Ïˆk(Ski) = Î±kSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by Î±k relative to the center tk 1âˆ’Î±k as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above Ïˆk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {Î±k,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î±kSk1 i âˆ’ tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: â€ž Î±k tk Â« = Aâˆ’1 k Lk (6) where Ak = â€ž P i Â¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i Â¯wiSk1 iP i Â¯wiSk1 i P i Â¯wi Â« (7) Lk = â€ž P i Â¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i Â¯wiS1k i Â« (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) = ( xâˆ’c0 c1âˆ’c0 Î± (c1 âˆ’ c0) + c0, if x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x otherwise where Î± > 0.",

                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",

                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",

Î´kl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",

                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "The reason of these eccentric distributions for Web-D and Web-F lies in their coarse rating systems.",
                "In fact, Web-D and Web-F use 2 or 3 point rating scales whereas other Web forums use 7 or 14 point rating scales.",

                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",

                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to <br>rank</br> objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",

                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to <br>rank</br> photos coming from different photo forums.",

                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal <br>rank</br> to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to <br>rank</br> photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to <br>rank</br> other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",

                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms Ïˆk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to <br>rank</br> Web objects from different Web sites.",

Â¯wk i (â‰¥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",

                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose Â¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of Â¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",

                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",

                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = Î±k Â· â€ž nk Â· Â¯Ski nk + nâˆ— k + nâˆ— k Â· Sâˆ— k nk + nâˆ— k Â« (2) to <br>rank</br> photos, where nk is the number of votes and nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k and Î±k are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score Â¯Ski and a reference score Sâˆ— k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than Â¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by Î±k to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(Î±k, nâˆ— k, Sâˆ— k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k Ã— k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 Ã— 6 and 7Ã—7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of Ïˆk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume Ïˆk has the following form Ïˆk(Ski) = Î±kSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) Ïˆ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by Î±k relative to the center tk 1âˆ’Î±k as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above Ïˆk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {Î±k,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î±kSk1 i âˆ’ tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( âˆ‚f âˆ‚Î±k = = 0 âˆ‚f âˆ‚tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: â€ž Î±k tk Â« = Aâˆ’1 k Lk (6) where Ak = â€ž P i Â¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i Â¯wiSk1 iP i Â¯wiSk1 i P i Â¯wi Â« (7) Lk = â€ž P i Â¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i Â¯wiS1k i Â« (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) = ( xâˆ’c0 c1âˆ’c0 Î± (c1 âˆ’ c0) + c0, if x âˆˆ (c0, c1] x otherwise where Î± > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x âˆˆ [c0, c1], Î·c0,c1,Î±(x) âˆˆ [c0, c1] with Î·c0,c1,Î±(c0) = c0 and Î·c0,c1,Î±(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], Ïˆk(Ski) = Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {Î±k|kâˆˆ[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 Â¯wk i h S1k i âˆ’ Î·M,T,Î±(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the <br>rank</br> results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureÎ´ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as Î´kl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) âˆ’ Sim(Slk âˆ— , Skl âˆ— ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl âˆ— = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a Â· b ||a||||b|| . Î´kl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if Î´kl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a <br>rank</br> aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several <br>rank</br> lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K <br>rank</br> lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of <br>rank</br> fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to <br>rank</br>.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",
