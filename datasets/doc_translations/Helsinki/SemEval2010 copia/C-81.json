In this paper, we present an adaptive duty cycling algorithm that allows energy harvesting sensor nodes to autonomously adjust their duty cycle according to the energy availability in the environment. The algorithm has three objectives, namely (a) achieving energy neutral operation, i.e., energy consumption should not be more than the energy provided by the environment, (b) maximizing the system performance based on an application utility model subject to the above energyneutrality constraint, and (c) adapting to the dynamics of the energy source at run-time. We present a model that enables harvesting sensor nodes to predict future energy opportunities based on historical data. We also derive an upper bound on the maximum achievable performance assuming perfect knowledge about the future behavior of the energy source. Our methods are evaluated using data gathered from a prototype solar energy harvesting platform and we show that our algorithm can utilize up to 58% more environmental energy compared to the case when harvesting-aware power management is not used.

INTRODUCTION Energy supply has always been a crucial issue in designing battery-powered wireless sensor networks because the lifetime and utility of the systems are limited by how long the batteries are able to sustain the operation. The fidelity of the data produced by a sensor network begins to degrade once sensor nodes start to run out of battery power. Therefore, harvesting energy from the environment has been proposed to supplement or completely replace battery supplies to enhance system lifetime and reduce the maintenance cost of replacing batteries periodically. However, metrics for evaluating energy harvesting systems are different from those used for battery powered systems. Environmental energy is distinct from battery energy in two ways. First it is an inexhaustible supply which, if appropriately used, can allow the system to last forever, unlike the battery which is a limited resource. Second, there is an uncertainty associated with its availability and measurement, compared to the energy stored in the battery which can be known deterministically. Thus, power management methods based on battery status are not always applicable to energy harvesting systems. In addition, most power management schemes designed for battery-powered systems only account for the dynamics of the energy consumers (e.g., CPU, radio) but not the dynamics of the energy supply. Consequently, battery powered systems usually operate at the lowest performance level that meets the minimum data fidelity requirement in order to maximize the system life. Energy harvesting systems, on the other hand, can provide enhanced performance depending on the available energy. In this paper, we will study how to adapt the performance of the available energy profile. There exist many techniques to accomplish performance scaling at the node level, such as radio transmit power adjustment [1], dynamic voltage scaling [2], and the use of low power modes [3]. However, these techniques require hardware support and may not always be available on resource constrained sensor nodes. Alternatively, a common performance scaling technique is duty cycling. Low power devices typically provide at least one low power mode in which the node is shut down and the power consumption is negligible. In addition, the rate of duty cycling is directly related to system performance metrics such as network latency and sampling frequency. We will use duty cycle adjustment as the primitive performance scaling technique in our algorithms. 2. RELATED WORK Energy harvesting has been explored for several different types of systems, such as wearable computers [4], [5], [6], sensor networks [7], etc. Several technologies to extract energy from the environment have been demonstrated including solar, motion-based, biochemical, vibration-based [8], [9], [10], [11], and others are being developed [12], [13]. While several energy harvesting sensor node platforms have been prototyped [14], [15], [16], there is a need for systematic power management techniques that provide performance guarantees during system operation. The first work to take environmental energy into account for data routing was [17], followed by [18]. While these works did demonstrate that environment aware decisions improve performance compared to battery aware decisions, their objective was not to achieve energy neutral operation. Our proposed techniques attempt to maximize system performance while maintaining energy-neutral operation. 3. SYSTEM MODEL The energy usage considerations in a harvesting system vary significantly from those in a battery powered system, as mentioned earlier. We propose the model shown in Figure 1 for designing energy management methods in a harvesting system. The functions of the various blocks shown in the figure are discussed below. The precise methods used in our system to achieve these functions will be discussed in subsequent sections. Harvested Energy Tracking: This block represents the mechanisms used to measure the energy received from the harvesting device, such as the solar panel. Such information is useful for determining the energy availability profile and adapting system performance based on it. Collecting this information requires that the node hardware be equipped with the facility to measure the power generated from the environment, and the Heliomote platform [14] we used for evaluating the algorithms has this capability. Energy Generation Model: For wireless sensor nodes with limited storage and processing capabilities to be able to use the harvested energy data, models that represent the essential components of this information without using extensive storage are required. The purpose of this block is to provide a model for the energy available to the system in a form that may be used for making power management decisions. The data measured by the energy tracking block is used here to predict future energy availability. A good prediction model should have a low prediction error and provide predicted energy values for durations long enough to make meaningful performance scaling decisions. Further, for energy sources that exhibit both long-term and short-term patterns (e.g., diurnal and climate variations vs. weather patterns for solar energy), the model must be able to capture both characteristics. Such a model can also use information from external sources such as local weather forecast service to improve its accuracy. Energy Consumption Model: It is also important to have detailed information about the energy usage characteristics of the system, at various performance levels. For general applicability of our design, we will assume that only one sleep mode is available. We assume that the power consumption in the sleep and active modes is known. It may be noted that for low power systems with more advanced capabilities such as dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), multiple low power modes, and the capability to shut down system components selectively, the power consumption in each of the states and the resultant effect on application performance should be known to make power management decisions. Energy Storage Model: This block represents the model for the energy storage technology. Since all the generated energy may not be used instantaneously, the harvesting system will usually have some energy storage technology. Storage technologies (e.g., batteries and ultra-capacitors) are non-ideal, in that there is some energy loss while storing and retrieving energy from them. These characteristics must be known to efficiently manage energy usage and storage. This block also includes the system capability to measure the residual stored energy. Most low power systems use batteries to store energy and provide residual battery status. This is commonly based on measuring the battery voltage which is then mapped to the residual battery energy using the known charge to voltage relationship for the battery technology in use. More sophisticated methods which track the flow of energy into and out of the battery are also available. Harvesting-aware Power Management: The inputs provided by the previously mentioned blocks are used here to determine the suitable power management strategy for the system. Power management could be carried to meet different objectives in different applications. For instance, in some systems, the harvested energy may marginally supplement the battery supply and the objective may be to maximize the system lifetime. A more interesting case is when the harvested energy is used as the primary source of energy for the system with the objective of achieving indefinitely long system lifetime. In such cases, the power management objective is to achieve energy neutral operation. In other words, the system should only use as much energy as harvested from the environment and attempt to maximize performance within this available energy budget. 4. THEORETICALLY OPTIMAL POWER MANAGEMENT We develop the following theory to understand the energy neutral mode of operation. Let us define Ps(t) as the energy harvested from the environment at time t, and the energy being consumed by the load at that time is Pc(t). Further, we model the non-ideal storage buffer by its round-trip efficiency η (strictly less than 1) and a constant leakage power Pleak. Using this notation, applying the rule of energy conservation leads to the following inequality: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s leakP t P t dt P t P t dt P dtB η + + − − − ≥+ −∫ ∫ ∫ (1) where B0 is the initial battery level and the function [X]+ = X if X > 0 and zero otherwise. DEFINITION 1 (ρ,σ1,σ2) function: A non-negative, continuous and bounded function P (t) is said to be a (ρ,σ1,σ2) function if and only if for any value of finite real number T , the following are satisfied: 2 1( ) T T P t dt Tρ σ ρ σ− ≤ ≤ +∫ (2) This function can be used to model both energy sources and loads. If the harvested energy profile Ps(t) is a (ρ1,σ1,σ2) function, then the average rate of available energy over long durations becomes ρ1, and the burstiness is bounded by σ1 and σ2 . Similarly, Pc(t) can be modeled as a (ρ2,σ3) function, when ρ2 and σ3 are used to place an upper bound on power consumption (the inequality on the right side) while there are no minimum power consumption constraints. The condition for energy neutrality, equation (1), leads to the following theorem, based on the energy production, consumption, and energy buffer models discussed above. THEOREM 1 (ENERGY NEUTRAL OPERATION): Consider a harvesting system in which the energy production profile is characterized by a (ρ1, σ1, σ2) function, the load is characterized by a (ρ2, σ3) function and the energy buffer is characterized by parameters η for storage efficiency, and Pleak for leakage power. The following conditions are sufficient for the system to achieve energy neutrality: ρ2 ≤ ηρ1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ ησ2 + σ3 (4) B ≥ B0 (5) where B0 is the initial energy stored in the buffer and provides a lower bound on the capacity of the energy buffer B. The proof is presented in our prior work [19]. To adjust the duty cycle D using our performance scaling algorithm, we assume the following relation between duty cycle and the perceived utility of the system to the user: Suppose the utility of the application to the user is represented by U(D) when the system operates at a duty cycle D. Then, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ) , ( ) , U D if D D U D k D if D D D U D k if D D β = < = + ≤ ≤ = > This is a fairly general and simple model and the specific values of Dmin and Dmax may be determined as per application requirements. As an example, consider a sensor node designed to detect intrusion across a periphery. In this case, a linear increase in duty cycle translates into a linear increase in the detection probability. The fastest and the slowest speeds of the intruders may be known, leading to a minimum and Harvested Energy Tracking Energy Consumption Model Energy Storage Model Harvestingaware Power Mangement Energy Generation Model LOAD Figure 1. System model for an energy harvesting system. 181 maximum sensing delay tolerable, which results in the relevant Dmax and Dmin for the sensor node. While there may be cases where the relationship between utility and duty cycle may be non-linear, in this paper, we restrict our focus on applications that follow this linear model. In view of the above models for the system components and the required performance, the objective of our power management strategy is adjust the duty cycle D(i) dynamically so as to maximize the total utility U(D) over a period of time, while ensuring energy neutral operation for the sensor node. Before discussing the performance scaling methods for harvesting aware duty cycle adaptation, let us first consider the optimal power management strategy that is possible for a given energy generation profile. For the calculation of the optimal strategy, we assume complete knowledge of the energy availability profile at the node, including the availability in the future. The calculation of the optimal is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of our proposed algorithm. This is particularly useful for our algorithm since no prior algorithms are available to serve as a baseline for comparison. Suppose the time axis is partitioned into discrete slots of duration ΔT, and the duty cycle adaptation calculation is carried out over a window of Nw such time slots. We define the following energy profile variables, with the index i ranging over {1,…, Nw}: Ps(i) is the power output from the harvested source in time slot i, averaged over the slot duration, Pc is the power consumption of the load in active mode, and D(i) is the duty cycle used in slot i, whose value is to be determined. B(i) is the residual battery energy at the beginning of slot i. Following this convention, the battery energy left after the last slot in the window is represented by B(Nw+1). The values of these variables will depend on the choice of D(i). The energy used directly from the harvested source and the energy stored and used from the battery must be accounted for differently. Figure 2 shows two possible cases for Ps(i) in a time slot. Ps(i) may either be less than or higher than Pc , as shown on the left and right respectively. When Ps(i) is lower than Pc, some of the energy used by the load comes from the battery, while when Ps(i) is higher than Pc, all the energy used is supplied directly from the harvested source. The crosshatched area shows the energy that is available for storage into the battery while the hashed area shows the energy drawn from the battery. We can write the energy used from the battery in any slot i as: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )[ ] ( ) ( ){ } ( ) ( )[ ]1 1c cs s sB i B i TD i P P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η + + − + = Δ − − Δ − − − (6) In equation (6), the first term on the right hand side measures the energy drawn from the battery when Ps(i) < Pc, the next term measures the energy stored into the battery when the node is in sleep mode, and the last term measures the energy stored into the battery in active mode if Ps(i) > Pc. For energy neutral operation, we require the battery at the end of the window of Nw slots to be greater than or equal to the starting battery. Clearly, battery level will go down when the harvested energy is not available and the system is operated from stored energy. However, the window Nw is judiciously chosen such that over that duration, we expect the environmental energy availability to complete a periodic cycle. For instance, in the case of solar energy harvesting, Nw could be chosen to be a twenty-four hour duration, corresponding to the diurnal cycle in the harvested energy. This is an approximation since an ideal choice of the window size would be infinite, but a finite size must be used for analytical tractability. Further, the battery level cannot be negative at any time, and this is ensured by having a large enough initial battery level B0 such that node operation is sustained even in the case of total blackout during a window period. Stating the above constraints quantitatively, we can express the calculation of the optimal duty cycles as an optimization problem below: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = ∑ (7) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ){ } ( ) ( )1 1c s s s cB i B i TD i P P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η + + ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤− + = Δ − − Δ − − −⎣ ⎦ ⎣ ⎦ (8) 0(1)B B= (9) 0( 1)wB N B+ ≥ (10) min w( ) i {1,...,N }D i D≥ ∀ ∈ (11) max w( ) i {1,...,N }D i D≤ ∀ ∈ (12) The solution to the optimization problem yields the duty cycles that must be used in every slot and the evolution of residual battery over the course of Nw slots. Note that while the constraints above contain the non-linear function [x]+ , the quantities occurring within that function are all known constants. The variable quantities occur only in linear terms and hence the above optimization problem can be solved using standard linear programming techniques, available in popular optimization toolboxes. 5. HARVESTING-AWARE POWER MANAGEMENT We now present a practical algorithm for power management that may be used for adapting the performance based on harvested energy information. This algorithm attempts to achieve energy neutral operation without using knowledge of the future energy availability and maximizes the achievable performance within that constraint. The harvesting-aware power management strategy consists of three parts. The first part is an instantiation of the energy generation model which tracks past energy input profiles and uses them to predict future energy availability. The second part computes the optimal duty cycles based on the predicted energy, and this step uses our computationally tractable method to solve the optimization problem. The third part consists of a method to dynamically adapt the duty cycle in response to the observed energy generation profile in real time. This step is required since the observed energy generation may deviate significantly from the predicted energy availability and energy neutral operation must be ensured with the actual energy received rather than the predicted values. 5.1. Energy Prediction Model We use a prediction model based on Exponentially Weighted Moving-Average (EWMA). The method is designed to exploit the diurnal cycle in solar energy but at the same time adapt to the seasonal variations. A historical summary of the energy generation profile is maintained for this purpose. While the storage data size is limited to a vector length of Nw values in order to minimize the memory overheads of the power management algorithm, the window size is effectively infinite as each value in the history window depends on all the observed data up to that instant. The window size is chosen to be 24 hours and each time slot is taken to be 30 minutes as the variation in generated power by the solar panel using this setting is less than 10% between each adjacent slots. This yields Nw = 48. Smaller slot durations may be used at the expense of a higher Nw. The historical summary maintained is derived as follows. On a typical day, we expect the energy generation to be similar to the energy generation at the same time on the previous days. The value of energy generated in a particular slot is maintained as a weighted average of the energy received in the same time-slot during all observed days. The weights are exponential, resulting in decaying contribution from older Figure 2. Two possible cases for energy calculations Slot i Slot k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Active Sleep 182 data. More specifically, the historical average maintained for each slot is given by: 1 (1 )k k kx x xα α−= + − where α is the value of the weighting factor, kx is the observed value of energy generated in the slot, and 1kx − is the previously stored historical average. In this model, the importance of each day relative to the previous one remains constant because the same weighting factor was used for all days. The average value derived for a slot is treated as an estimate of predicted energy value for the slot corresponding to the subsequent day. This method helps the historical average values adapt to the seasonal variations in energy received on different days. One of the parameters to be chosen in the above prediction method is the parameter α, which is a measure of rate of shift in energy pattern over time. Since this parameter is affected by the characteristics of the energy and sensor node location, the system should have a training period during which this parameter will be determined. To determine a good value of α, we collected energy data over 72 days and compared the average error of the prediction method for various values of α. The error based on the different values of α is shown in Figure 3. This curve suggests an optimum value of α = 0.15 for minimum prediction error and this value will be used in the remainder of this paper. 5.2. Low-complexity Solution The energy values predicted for the next window of Nw slots are used to calculated the desired duty cycles for the next window, assuming the predicted values match the observed values in the future. Since our objective is to develop a practical algorithm for embedded computing systems, we present a simplified method to solve the linear programming problem presented in Section 4. To this end, we define the sets S and D as follows: { } { } | ( ) 0 | ( ) 0 s c c s S i P i P D i P P i = − ≥ = − > The two sets differ by the condition that whether the node operation can be sustained entirely from environmental energy. In the case that energy produced from the environment is not sufficient, battery will be discharged to supplement the remaining energy. Next we sum up both sides of (6) over the entire Nw window and rewrite it with the new notation. 1 1 1 1 ( )[ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )[ ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s s c i i D i i i S B B TD i P P i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η η+ = ∈ = = ∈ − = Δ − − Δ + Δ − Δ −∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ The term on the left hand side is actually the battery energy used over the entire window of Nw slots, which can be set to 0 for energy neutral operation. After some algebraic manipulation, this yields: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i i D i S P P i D i P i P D i η η= ∈ ∈ ⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞ = + − +⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠ ∑ ∑ ∑ (13) The term on the left hand side is the total energy received in Nw slots. The first term on the right hand side can be interpreted as the total energy consumed during the D slots and the second term is the total energy consumed during the S slots. We can now replace three constraints (8), (9), and (10) in the original problem with (13), restating the optimization problem as follows: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = ∑ 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i i D i S P P i D i P i P D i η η= ∈ ∈ ⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞ = + − +⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠ ∑ ∑ ∑ min max D(i) D {1,...,Nw) D(i) D {1,...,Nw) i i ≥ ∀ ∈ ≤ ∀ ∈ This form facilitates a low complexity solution that doesnt require a general linear programming solver. Since our objective is to maximize the total system utility, it is preferable to set the duty cycle to Dmin for time slots where the utility per unit energy is the least. On the other hand, we would also like the time slots with the highest Ps to operate at Dmax because of better efficiency of using energy directly from the energy source. Combining these two characteristics, we define the utility co-efficient for each slot i as follows: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P P i for i D η η ∈⎧ ⎪ = ⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞⎨ + − ∈⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟⎪ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠⎩ where W(i) is a representation of how efficient the energy usage in a particular time slot i is. A larger W(i) indicates more system utility per unit energy in slot i and vice versa. The algorithm starts by assuming D(i) =Dmin for i = {1…NW} because of the minimum duty cycle requirement, and computes the remaining system energy R by: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P R P i D i P i P D i η η= ∈ ∈ ⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞ = − + − −⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠ ∑ ∑ ∑ A negative R concludes that the optimization problem is infeasible, meaning the system cannot achieve energy neutrality even at the minimum duty cycle. In this case, the system designer is responsible for increasing the environment energy availability (e.g., by using larger solar panels). If R is positive, it means the system has excess energy that is not being used, and this may be allocated to increase the duty cycle beyond Dmin for some slots. Since our objective is to maximize the total system utility, the most efficient way to allocate the excess energy is to assign duty cycle Dmax to the slots with the highest W(i). So, the coefficients W(i) are arranged in decreasing order and duty cycle Dmax is assigned to the slots beginning with the largest coefficients until the excess energy available, R (computed by (14) in every iteration), is insufficient to assign Dmax to another slot. The remaining energy, RLast, is used to increase the duty cycle to some value between Dmin and Dmax in the slot with the next lower coefficient. Denoting this slot with index j, the duty cycle is given by: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last s c s R P if j D DR if j S P j P P jη ∈⎧ ⎫ ⎪ ⎪ +⎨ ⎬ ∈⎪ ⎪− −⎩ ⎭ The above solution to the optimization problem requires only simple arithmetic calculations and one sorting step which can be easily implemented on an embedded platform, as opposed to implementing a general linear program solver. 5.3. Slot-by-slot continual duty cycle adaptiation. The observed energy values may vary greatly from the predicted ones, such as due to the effect of clouds or other sudden changes. It is thus important to adapt the duty cycles calculated using the predicted values, to the actual energy measurements in real time to ensure energy neutrality. Denote the initial duty cycle assignments for each time slot i computed using the predicted energy values as D(i) = {1, ...,Nw}. First we compute the difference between predicted power level Ps(i) and actual power level observed, Ps(i) in every slot i. Then, the excess energy in slot i, denoted by X, can be obtained as follows: ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( )[ ( ) ( )](1 ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s c P i P i if P i P X P i P i D i P i P i if P i P η − >⎧ ⎪ = ⎨ − − − − ≤⎪ ⎩ 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3 alpha AvgError(mA) Figure 3. Choice of prediction parameter. 183 The upper term accounts for the energy difference when actual received energy is more than the power drawn by the load. On the other hand, if the energy received is less than Pc, we will need to account for the extra energy used from the battery by the load, which is a function of duty cycle used in time slot i and battery efficiency factor η. When more energy is received than predicted, X is positive and that excess energy is available for use in the subsequent solutes, while if X is negative, that energy must be compensated from subsequent slots. CASE I: X<0. In this case, we want to reduce the duty cycles used in the future slots in order to make up for this shortfall of energy. Since our objective function is to maximize the total system utility, we have to reduce the duty cycles for time slots with the smallest normalized utility coefficient, W(i). This is accomplished by first sorting the coefficient W(j) ,where j>i. in decreasing order, and then iteratively reducing Dj to Dmin until the total reduction in energy consumption is the same as X. CASE II: X>0. Here, we want to increase the duty cycles used in the future to utilize this excess energy we received in recent time slot. In contrast to Case I, the duty cycles of future time slots with highest utility coefficient W(i) should be increased first in order to maximize the total system utility. Suppose the duty cycle is changed by d in slot j. Define a quantity R(j,d) as follows: ⎪ ⎩ ⎪ ⎨ ⎧ <=⎟ ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ −+ >⋅ = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 　　　 1 1 　　d　　 ),( ηη The precise procedure to adapt the duty cycle to account for the above factors is presented in Algorithm 1. This calculation is performed at the end of every slot to set the duty cycle for the next slot. We claim that our duty cycling algorithm is energy neutral because an surplus of energy at the previous time slot will always translate to additional energy opportunity for future time slots, and vice versa. The claim may be violated in cases of severe energy shortages especially towards the end of window. For example, a large deficit in energy supply cant be restored if there is no future energy input until the end of the window. In such case, this offset will be carried over to the next window so that long term energy neutrality is still maintained. 6. EVALUATION Our adaptive duty cycling algorithm was evaluated using an actual solar energy profile measured using a sensor node called Heliomote, capable of harvesting solar energy [14]. This platform not only tracks the generated energy but also the energy flow into and out of the battery to provide an accurate estimate of the stored energy. The energy harvesting platform was deployed in a residential area in Los Angeles from the beginning of June through the middle of August for a total of 72 days. The sensor node used is a Mica2 mote running at a fixed 40% duty cycle with an initially full battery. Battery voltage and net current from the solar panels are sampled at a period of 10 seconds. The energy generation profile for that duration, measured by tracking the output current from the solar cell is shown in Figure 4, both on continuous and diurnal scales. We can observe that although the energy profile varies from day to day, it still exhibits a general pattern over several days. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Day mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Hour mA 6.1. Prediction Model We first evaluate the performance of the prediction model, which is judged by the amount of absolute error it made between the predicted and actual energy profile. Figure 5 shows the average error of each time slot in mA over the entire 72 days. Generally, the amount of error is larger during the day time because thats when the factor of weather can cause deviations in received energy, while the prediction made for night time is mostly correct. 6.2. Adaptive Duty cycling algorithm Prior methods to optimize performance while achieving energy neutral operation using harvested energy are scarce. Instead, we compare the performance of our algorithm against two extremes: the theoretical optimal calculated assuming complete knowledge about future energy availability and a simple approach which attempts to achieve energy neutrality using a fixed duty cycle without accounting for battery inefficiency. The optimal duty cycles are calculated for each slot using the future knowledge of actual received energy for that slot. For the simple approach, the duty cycle is kept constant within each day and is Figure 4 Solar Energy Profile (Left: Continuous, Right: Diurnal) Input: D: Initial duty cycle, X: Excess energy due to error in the prediction, P: Predicted energy profile, i: index of current time slot Output: D: Updated duty cycles in one or more subsequent slots AdaptDutyCycle() Iteration: At each time slot do: if X > 0 Wsorted = W{1, ...,Nw} sorted in decending order.

Figure 6 shows the results, using Dmax = 0.8 and Dmin = 0.3. The battery efficiency was varied from 0.5 to 1 on the x-axis and solar energy utilizations achieved by the three algorithms are shown on the y-axis. It shows the fraction of net received energy that is used to perform useful work rather than lost due to storage inefficiency. As can be seen from the figure, battery efficiency factor has great impact on the performance of the three different approaches. The three approaches all converges to 100% utilization if we have a perfect battery (η=1), that is, energy is not lost by storing it into the batteries. When battery inefficiency is taken into account, both the adaptive and optimal approach have much better solar energy utilization rate than the simple one. Additionally, the result also shows that our adaptive duty cycle algorithm performs extremely close to the optimal. 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Eta-batery roundtrip efficiency SolarEnergyUtilization(%) Optimal Adaptive Simple We also compare the performance of our algorithm with different values of Dmin and Dmax for η=0.7, which is typical of NiMH batteries. These results are shown in Table 1 as the percentage of energy saved by the optimal and adaptive approaches, and this is the energy which would normally be wasted in the simple approach. The figures and table indicate that our real time algorithm is able to achieve a performance very close to the optimal feasible. In addition, these results show that environmental energy harvesting with appropriate power management can achieve much better utilization of the environmental energy.

CONCLUSIONS We discussed various issues in power management for systems powered using environmentally harvested energy. Specifically, we designed a method for optimizing performance subject to the constraint of energy neutral operation. We also derived a theoretically optimal bound on the performance and showed that our proposed algorithm operated very close to the optimal. The proposals were evaluated using real data collected using an energy harvesting sensor node deployed in an outdoor environment. Our method has significant advantages over currently used methods which are based on a conservative estimate of duty cycle and can only provide sub-optimal performance. However, this work is only the first step towards optimal solutions for energy neutral operation. It is designed for a specific power scaling method based on adapting the duty cycle. Several other power scaling methods, such as DVS, submodule power switching and the use of multiple low power modes are also available. It is thus of interest to extend our methods to exploit these advanced capabilities. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento. Presentamos un modelo que permite la recolección de nodos de sensores para predecir futuras oportunidades energéticas basadas en datos históricos. También derivamos un límite superior en el rendimiento máximo alcanzable asumiendo el conocimiento perfecto sobre el comportamiento futuro de la fuente de energía. Nuestros métodos se evalúan utilizando datos recopilados a partir de una plataforma de recolección de energía solar prototipo y mostramos que nuestro algoritmo puede utilizar hasta un 58% más de energía ambiental en comparación con el caso en que no se utiliza la gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una gestión adecuada de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un \"sistema de recolección de energía\". 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una gestión adecuada de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una \"red de sensores\" comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una gestión adecuada de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la \"energía ambiental\" para el enrutamiento de datos fue [17], seguido por [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida sabiamente de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de \"energía ambiental\" complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente de \"energía ambiental\". En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la recolección de \"energía ambiental\" con una adecuada gestión de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la \"energía ambiental\".

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de \"gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha\" consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una gestión adecuada de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Por lo tanto, los métodos de \"gestión de energía\" basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de \"gestión de energía\" diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías sólo tienen en cuenta la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de \"gestión de energía\" que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que pueda ser utilizada para tomar decisiones de \"gestión de energía\". Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de \"gestión de energía\". Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia adecuada de \"gestión de energía\" para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la \"gestión de la energía\" es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de \"gestión de energía\" es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de \"gestión de energía\" que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER DE AGUA DE HARVESTING Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la \"gestión de energía\" que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de \"gestión de energía\" consciente de la cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de \"gestión de energía\", el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana del historial depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una \"gestión de energía\" adecuada puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en \"gestión de energía\" para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el \"escalado de rendimiento\" a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica común de escalado de rendimiento es el ciclismo de guardia. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la primitiva técnica de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debería tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de \"escalado de rendimiento\". Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de \"escalado de rendimiento\" para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una gestión adecuada de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento. Presentamos un modelo que permite la recolección de nodos de sensores para predecir futuras oportunidades energéticas basadas en datos históricos. También derivamos un límite superior en el rendimiento máximo alcanzable asumiendo el conocimiento perfecto sobre el comportamiento futuro de la fuente de energía. Nuestros métodos se evalúan utilizando datos recopilados a partir de una plataforma de recolección de energía solar prototipo y mostramos que nuestro algoritmo puede utilizar hasta un 58% más de energía ambiental en comparación con el caso en que no se utiliza la gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una gestión adecuada de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la \"latencia de la red\" y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una gestión adecuada de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la \"frecuencia de muestreo\". Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una gestión adecuada de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el \"panel solar\". Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma en 30 minutos, ya que la variación en la potencia generada por el \"panel solar\" utilizando esta configuración es inferior al 10% entre cada ranura adyacente. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una gestión adecuada de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento. Presentamos un modelo que permite la recolección de nodos de sensores para predecir futuras oportunidades energéticas basadas en datos históricos. También derivamos un límite superior en el rendimiento máximo alcanzable asumiendo el conocimiento perfecto sobre el comportamiento futuro de la fuente de energía. Nuestros métodos se evalúan utilizando datos recopilados a partir de una plataforma de recolección de energía solar prototipo y mostramos que nuestro algoritmo puede utilizar hasta un 58% más de energía ambiental en comparación con el caso en que no se utiliza la gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque \"tracking energético\" se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una gestión adecuada de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una \"operación neutra energética\", es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr una \"operación neutra energética\". Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una \"operación neutra energética\". En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, asegurando al mismo tiempo una \"operación neutra energética\" para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para \"operación neutra energética\", necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una \"operación neutra energética\" sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y la \"operación neutra energética\" debe garantizarse con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una \"operación neutra energética\" con energía recolectada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una gestión adecuada de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de \"operación neutra energética\". También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para una \"operación neutra energética\". Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el \"búfer de almacenamiento\" no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una gestión adecuada de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del \"ciclo de trabajo\" como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el \"ciclo de trabajo\" D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre \"ciclo de trabajo\" y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema opera en un \"ciclo de trabajo\" D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el \"ciclo de trabajo\" se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y \"ciclo de trabajo\" puede ser no lineal, en este artículo, limitamos nuestro enfoque en aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el \"ciclo de trabajo\" D(i) dinámicamente para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para la adaptación consciente del \"ciclo de trabajo\", consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Supongamos que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de adaptación \"ciclo de trabajo\" se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el \"ciclo de trabajo\" utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se debe determinar. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el \"ciclo de trabajo\" en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el \"ciclo de trabajo\" a Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza asumiendo D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito de \"ciclo de trabajo\" mínimo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i D i S P I R P i P i P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positivo, significa que el sistema tiene exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el \"ciclo de trabajo\" más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar \"ciclo de trabajo\" Dmax a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y \"ciclo de trabajo\" Dmax se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el \"ciclo de trabajo\" a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con el índice j, el \"ciclo de trabajo\" es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P si j D DR si j S P p p jη             La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos 5.3. Adaptación continua \"ciclo de trabajo\" ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales de \"ciclo de trabajo\" para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función de \"ciclo de trabajo\" utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el \"ciclo de trabajo\" es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el \"ciclo de Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el \"ciclo de trabajo\" para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un \"ciclo de trabajo\" fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un \"ciclo de trabajo\" fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el \"ciclo de trabajo\" se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de Energía Solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: \"ciclo de trabajo inicial\", X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDu Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este \"ciclo de servicio\". {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería.

Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del \"ciclo de trabajo\" y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del \"ciclo de trabajo\". También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ",

El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1.

La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una gestión adecuada de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método específico de \"escalado de potencia\" basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de \"escalado de potencia\", como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una gestión adecuada de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.

El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber: a) lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser superior a la energía suministrada por el medio ambiente; b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema sobre la base de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a las restricciones de neutralidad energética mencionadas anteriormente, y c) adaptarse a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de funcionamiento. Presentamos un modelo que permite la recolección de nodos de sensores para predecir futuras oportunidades energéticas basadas en datos históricos. También derivamos un límite superior en el rendimiento máximo alcanzable asumiendo el conocimiento perfecto sobre el comportamiento futuro de la fuente de energía.

INTRODUCCIÓN El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos alimentadas por baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitados por el tiempo que las baterías son capaces de sostener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos de sensores comienzan a quedarse sin batería. Por lo tanto, se ha propuesto la extracción de energía del medio ambiente para complementar o reemplazar completamente los suministros de baterías a fin de mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de la sustitución periódica de baterías. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de captación de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por baterías. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de las baterías de dos maneras. En primer lugar es una fuente inagotable que, si se utiliza adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, hay una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinísticamente. Así pues, los métodos de gestión de la energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de captación de energía. Además, la mayoría de los sistemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas alimentados por baterías solo explican la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio), pero no la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por baterías normalmente funcionan al nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito de fidelidad de datos mínimo para maximizar la vida del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un mejor rendimiento dependiendo de la energía disponible. En este trabajo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil energético disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr el escalado de rendimiento a nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión por radio [1], el escalado dinámico de voltaje [2], y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos de sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escalado de rendimiento común es el ciclismo de servicio. Los dispositivos de baja potencia suelen proporcionar al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo se apaga y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, el tipo de bicicleta de servicio está directamente relacionado con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Usaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica primitiva de escalado de rendimiento en nuestros algoritmos. 2. TRABAJOS RELACIONADOS Se ha explorado la recolección de energía para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como ordenadores portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, entre ellas la solar, la basada en el movimiento, la bioquímica, la basada en las vibraciones [8], [9], [10], [11], y otras se están desarrollando [12], [13]. Si bien varias plataformas de sensores de captación de energía han sido prototipos [14], [15], [16], se necesitan técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante el funcionamiento del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el encaminamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones con conocimiento del medio ambiente mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones con conocimiento de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr un funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que mantienen una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. 3. MODELO DEL SISTEMA Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de recolección varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por baterías, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión energética en un sistema de recolección. A continuación se examinan las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de Energía Cosechada: Este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de recolección, como el panel solar. Esta información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y adaptar el rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recolección de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la energía generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: Para que los nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades de almacenamiento y procesamiento limitadas puedan utilizar los datos de energía recolectada, se requieren modelos que representen los componentes esenciales de esta información sin utilizar almacenamiento extenso. El objetivo de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que se pueda utilizar para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento energético se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un error de predicción bajo y proporcionar valores de energía predichos para duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones significativas de escalado de rendimiento. Además, en el caso de las fuentes de energía que presentan patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones meteorológicos para la energía solar), el modelo debe ser capaz de captar ambas características. Este modelo también puede utilizar información de fuentes externas, como el servicio de previsión meteorológica local, para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: También es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que sólo un modo de sueño está disponible. Asumimos que el consumo de energía en los modos de sueño y activo es conocido. Cabe señalar que para los sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como el escalado dinámico de voltaje (DVS), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de apagar los componentes del sistema de forma selectiva, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante en el rendimiento de la aplicación deben ser conocidos para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: Este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Puesto que toda la energía generada puede no ser utilizada instantáneamente, el sistema de recolección por lo general tendrá alguna tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultracapacitadores) no son ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Estas características deben ser conocidas para gestionar eficientemente el uso y almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía residual almacenada. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja potencia utilizan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar estado residual de la batería. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la carga conocida a la relación de voltaje para la tecnología de la batería en uso. También están disponibles métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: Las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía recolectada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de la batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía recolectada se utiliza como la principal fuente de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de la gestión de la energía es lograr una operación neutra desde el punto de vista energético. En otras palabras, el sistema sólo debe utilizar tanta energía como se extraiga del medio ambiente y tratar de maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto energético disponible. 4. TEORÉTICAMENTE GESTIÓN DE PODER OPTIMAL Desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para entender el modo de funcionamiento neutro de la energía. Definimos Ps(t) como la energía recolectada del medio ambiente en el momento t, y la energía que se consume por la carga en ese momento es Pc(t). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal por su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y una potencia de fuga constante Pleak. Utilizando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s fugaP t P t dt P t t dt P dt B η + + − − DEFINICIÓN 1 (.e,.e,.e) función: Una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) se dice que es una función (.e,.e,.e) si y sólo si para cualquier valor del número real finito T, se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 ) T T P t dt T Si el perfil de energía cosechada Ps(t) es una función (l, 1 y 2), entonces la tasa media de energía disponible a largo plazo se convierte en 1 y la ráfaga está limitada por 1 y 2. Del mismo modo, Pc(t) se puede modelar como una función (equivalente a 2,03), cuando se utilizan equivalentes a 2 y 3 para poner un límite superior al consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay limitaciones mínimas al consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad energética, ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, basado en los modelos de producción, consumo y amortiguador de energía discutidos anteriormente. TEOREMA 1 (OPERACIÓN NEUTRAL DE ENERGÍA): Considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (e1, Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad energética: ♥2 ≤ 1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ 2 + La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escalado de rendimiento, suponemos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema para el usuario: Supongamos que la utilidad de la aplicación para el usuario está representada por U(D) cuando el sistema funciona en un ciclo de trabajo D. Entonces, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ), ( ), U D si D D D U D k Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión a través de una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Las velocidades más rápidas y lentas de los intrusos pueden ser conocidas, lo que conduce a un mínimo y cosechado de energía de seguimiento de consumo de energía Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Modelo de recolección de energía de manipulación de energía Modelo de generación de energía LOAD Figura 1. Modelo de sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía. 181 retardo máximo de detección tolerable, que resulta en el Dmax y Dmin correspondientes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre utilidad y ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, limitamos nuestro enfoque en las aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D(i) de forma dinámica para maximizar la utilidad total U(D) durante un período de tiempo, al tiempo que garantiza el funcionamiento neutro de la energía para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escalado de rendimiento para cosechar la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo consciente, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía dado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluyendo la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como base para la comparación. Suponga que el eje de tiempo se divide en franjas de tiempo discretas ΔT, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo a través de una ventana de Nw tales franjas de tiempo. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice i variando sobre {1,..., Nw}: Ps(i) es la salida de energía de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo i, promediado durante la duración de la ranura, Pc es el consumo de energía de la carga en modo activo, y D(i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura i, cuyo valor se determinará. B(i) es la energía residual de la batería al principio de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería que queda después de la última ranura en la ventana es representada por B(Nw+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D(i). La energía utilizada directamente desde la fuente recolectada y la energía almacenada y utilizada desde la batería deben contabilizarse de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para Ps(i) en un espacio de tiempo. Ps(i) puede ser inferior o superior a Pc, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha respectivamente. Cuando Ps(i) es inferior a Pc, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando Ps(i) es superior a Pc, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente de la fuente recolectada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashed muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ]1 1c cs sB i B i TD i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + − + = Δ − Δ − − (6) En la ecuación (6) Para el funcionamiento de energía neutra, necesitamos que la batería al final de la ventana de ranuras Nw sea mayor o igual a la batería de arranque. Claramente, el nivel de la batería bajará cuando la energía recolectada no esté disponible y el sistema sea operado a partir de la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana Nw es escogida con prudencia de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, Nw podría ser elegido para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía recolectada. Se trata de una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero un tamaño finito debe ser utilizado para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel de batería inicial B0 lo suficientemente grande como para que el funcionamiento del nodo se mantenga incluso en caso de apagón total durante un período de ventana. Al establecer las limitaciones mencionadas anteriormente cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de trabajo óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = 7 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) } ( ) ( ) 1 1c s s s cB i B i P i P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη + Tenga en cuenta que mientras que las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son todas constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren sólo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las populares cajas de herramientas de optimización. 5. GESTIÓN DE PODER HARVESTING-AWARE Ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede ser utilizado para adaptar el rendimiento basado en la información de energía recolectada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutra energética sin utilizar el conocimiento de la futura disponibilidad de energía y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía con conocimiento de cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad futura de energía. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de trabajo óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Este paso es necesario ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y debe garantizarse una operación neutra con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores previstos. 5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en la media de movimiento ponderada exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno de la energía solar pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Para ello se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía. Mientras que el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de valores Nw con el fin de minimizar los gastos de memoria del algoritmo de gestión de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana de historia depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se toma para ser 30 minutos ya que la variación en la energía generada por el panel solar utilizando este ajuste es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto da Nw = 48. Las duraciones de ranura más pequeñas pueden ser utilizadas a expensas de un Nw más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura determinada se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma franja horaria durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, resultando en una contribución decadente a partir de la edad Figura 2. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Ranura i Ranura k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Datos del sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura es dado por: 1 (1 )k k k x x  = + − donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, kx es el valor observado de la energía generada en la ranura, y 1kx − es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque se utilizó el mismo factor de ponderación para todos los días. El valor medio derivado de una ranura se considera una estimación del valor de energía previsto para la ranura correspondiente al día siguiente. Este método ayuda a que los valores promedio históricos se adapten a las variaciones estacionales de la energía recibida en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la velocidad de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de los nodos de energía y sensores, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0,15 para error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este artículo. 5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de ranuras Nw se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de trabajo deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para sistemas de computación integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Con este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D de la siguiente manera: { } { }  ( ) 0  ( ) 0 c c c s S i P i P i P i P i = − ≥ = − > Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que la operación del nodo puede sostenerse enteramente a partir de la energía ambiental. En caso de que la energía producida a partir del medio ambiente no sea suficiente, se descargará la batería para complementar la energía restante. A continuación sumamos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana Nw y lo reescribimos con la nueva notación. 1 1 1 ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s c i i D i i i S B TD i P i TP i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η  =  = = Δ − Δ + Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i I D i S P i P i P i P I D i η η =     = + −       .».» (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la El primer término en el lado derecho puede interpretarse como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), repitiendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max ( ) wN i D i I = 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s c i I D i S P i P i P I D i η η = Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en Dmin para las franjas horarias donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es la menor. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría que las franjas horarias con las Ps más altas operaran en Dmax debido a una mejor eficiencia en el uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos el co-eficiente de utilidad para cada ranura i como sigue: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P i for i D η η   =    + −        donde W(i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de Un W(i) más grande indica más utilidad del sistema por unidad de energía en la ranura i y viceversa. El algoritmo comienza por asumir D(i) = Dmin para i = {1...NW} debido al requisito mínimo del ciclo de trabajo, y calcula el resto de energía del sistema R por: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P I R P i P I P D i η η = En este caso, el diseñador de sistemas es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía ambiental (por ejemplo, utilizando paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positiva, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de Dmin para algunas franjas horarias. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la manera más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar Dmax de ciclo de trabajo a las ranuras con el W(i) más alto. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes W(i) están dispuestos en orden decreciente y Dmax ciclo de trabajo se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta el exceso de energía disponible, R (computado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar Dmax a otra ranura. La energía restante, RLast, se utiliza para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y Dmax en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente inferior. Denotando esta ranura con índice j, el ciclo de trabajo es dado por: D(j)= min / ( ( ) ) / ( ) Last c Last c s R P if j D DR if j S P p p jη            La solución anterior al problema de optimización requiere sólo cálculos aritméticos simples y un 5.3. Adaptación continua del ciclo de trabajo ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, tales como debido al efecto de nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de trabajo calculados utilizando los valores previstos, a las mediciones energéticas reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad energética. Denote las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada franja horaria i calculada utilizando los valores de energía previstos como D(i) = {1,...,Nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho Ps(i) y el nivel de potencia real observado, Ps(i) en cada ranura i. Entonces, el exceso de energía en la ranura i, denotado por X, puede obtenerse de la siguiente manera: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s s s s s s s s s s Elección del parámetro de predicción. 183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es mayor que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que Pc, tendremos que tener en cuenta la energía adicional que se utiliza de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo i y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de la prevista, X es positiva y el exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. CASO I: X<0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las futuras franjas horarias para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetiva es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para franjas horarias con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W(i). Esto se logra primero ordenando el coeficiente W(j),donde j>i. en orden decreciente, y luego reducir iterativamente Dj a Dmin hasta que la reducción total del consumo de energía sea la misma que X. CASO II: X>0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. En contraste con el Caso I, los ciclos de servicio de las franjas horarias futuras con mayor coeficiente de utilidad W(i) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por d en la ranura j. Definir una cantidad R(j,d) de la siguiente manera:                       = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 1 1 d ),(  El procedimiento preciso para adaptar el ciclo de trabajo Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la siguiente ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio es neutro porque un excedente de energía en la franja horaria anterior siempre se traducirá en una oportunidad de energía adicional para las franjas horarias futuras, y viceversa. La reclamación puede ser violada en casos de grave escasez de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, no se puede restablecer un gran déficit en el suministro de energía si no se dispone de energía hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, esta compensación se trasladará a la siguiente ventana de modo que se mantenga la neutralidad energética a largo plazo. 6. EVALUACIÓN Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo fue evaluado utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado Heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no sólo rastrea la energía generada, sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía fue desplegada en una zona residencial de Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto por un total de 72 días. El nodo sensor utilizado es un mote Mica2 que funciona en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente llena. La tensión de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido mediante el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar, se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continua como diurna. Podemos observar que aunque el perfil energético varía de día en día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 día mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 hora mA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que hizo entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada franja horaria en mA durante los 72 días completos. Generalmente, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque eso es cuando el factor del tiempo puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción hecha para la noche es mayormente correcta. 6.2. Algoritmo de ciclismo Adaptive Duty Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento y lograr una operación neutra con energía con energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: el óptimo teórico calculado asumiendo el conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad energética utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de trabajo óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (Izquierda: Continua, Derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido a errores en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, i: índice de la franja horaria actual Salida: D: Ciclos de trabajo actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores AdaptDutyCy Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ i o D(Q(k)) ≥ Dmax //slot ya se pasa si R(Q(k)), Dmax − D(Q(k))) < X D(Q(k)) = Dmax X = X − R(j, Dmax − D(Q(k Q := índices de Wsred para k = 1 a Q si Q(k) ≤ I o D(Q(k)) ≤ Dmin continúan si R(Q(k), Dmax − D(Q(k))) > X D(Q(k)) = Dmin X = X − R(j, Dmin − D(Q(k))) si no P ( Error promedio de predictor en mA 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(H) abserror(mA) 184 calculado tomando la relación de la disponibilidad de energía prevista y el uso máximo, y esto garantiza que el nodo señor nunca agotará su batería funcionando en este ciclo de trabajo. {1.. ) ( )s w c i Nw D P i N Pη  =   A continuación, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo a los dos extremos con diferentes eficiencia de la batería. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando Dmax = 0,8 y Dmin = 0,3. La eficiencia de la batería variaba de 0,5 a 1 en el eje x y las utilizaciones de energía solar logradas por los tres algoritmos se muestran en el eje y. Muestra la fracción de energía neta recibida que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perderse debido a la ineficiencia del almacenamiento. Como puede verse en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques todos convergen a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η=1), es decir, la energía no se pierde almacenando en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de la energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona extremadamente cerca de lo óptimo. 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 Eficiencia de ida y vuelta de la ETA Energía SolarUtilización(%) Optima Adaptativa Simple También comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η=0,7, lo cual es típico de las baterías NiMH. Estos resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 como el porcentaje de energía ahorrada por los enfoques óptimos y adaptativos, y esta es la energía que normalmente se desperdiciaría en el enfoque simple. Las cifras y la tabla indican que nuestro algoritmo en tiempo real es capaz de lograr un rendimiento muy cercano a lo óptimo posible. Además, estos resultados muestran que la captación de energía ambiental con una gestión adecuada de la energía puede lograr una utilización mucho mejor de la energía ambiental.

CONCLUSIONES Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de funcionamiento neutro energético. También derivamos un vínculo teórico óptimo en el rendimiento y demostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno exterior. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos actualmente utilizados que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y sólo puede proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es sólo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para un funcionamiento energético neutro. Está diseñado para un método de escalado de potencia específico basado en la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escalado de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de potencia de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es de interés ampliar nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas. 8.
