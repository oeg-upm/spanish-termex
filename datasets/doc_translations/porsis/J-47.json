Most existing iterative combinatorial auctions are based on repeatedly suggesting prices for bundles of items, and querying the bidders for their demand under these prices. We prove a large number of results showing the boundaries of what can be achieved by auctions of this kind. We first focus on auctions that use a polynomial number of demand queries, and then we analyze the power of different kinds of ascending-price auctions.

INTRODUCTION Combinatorial auctions have recently received a lot of attention. In a combinatorial auction, a set M of m nonidentical items are sold in a single auction to n competing bidders. The bidders have preferences regarding the bundles of items that they may receive. The preferences of bidder i are specified by a valuation function vi : 2M → R+ , where vi(S) denotes the value that bidder i attaches to winning the bundle of items S. We assume free disposal, i.e., that the vis are monotone non-decreasing. The usual goal of the auctioneer is to optimize the social welfare P i vi(Si), where the allocation S1...Sn must be a partition of the items. Applications include many complex resource allocation problems and, in fact, combinatorial auctions may be viewed as the common abstraction of many complex resource allocation problems. Combinatorial auctions face both economic and computational difficulties and are a central problem in the recently active border of economic theory and computer science. A forthcoming book [11] addresses many of the issues involved in the design and implementation of combinatorial auctions. The design of a combinatorial auction involves many considerations. In this paper we focus on just one central issue: the communication between bidders and the allocation mechanism - preference elicitation. Transferring all information about bidders preferences requires an infeasible (exponential in m) amount of communication. Thus, direct revelation auctions in which bidders simply declare their preferences to the mechanism are only practical for very small auction sizes or for very limited families of bidder preferences. We have therefore seen a multitude of suggested iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly interacts with the different bidders, aiming to adaptively elicit enough information about the bidders preferences as to be able to find a good (optimal or close to optimal) allocation. Most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the bundles under the current set of prices, and then updating the set of bundle prices according to the replies received (e.g., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]). Effectively, such an iterative auction accesses the bidders preferences by repeatedly making the following type of demand query to bidders: Query to bidder i: a vector of bundle prices p = {p(S)}S⊆M ; Answer: a bundle of items S ⊆ M that maximizes vi(S) − p(S).. These types of queries are very natural in an economic setting as they capture the revealed preferences of the bidders. Some auctions, called item-price or linear-price auctions, specify a price pi for each item, and the price of any given bundle S is always linear, p(S) = P i∈S pi. Other auctions, called bundle-price auctions, allow specifying arbitrary (non-linear) prices p(S) for bundles. Another important differentiation between models of iterative auctions is 29 based on whether they use anonymous or non-anonymous prices: In some auctions the prices that are presented to the bidders are always the same (anonymous prices). In other auctions (non-anonymous), different bidders may face different (discriminatory) vectors of prices. In ascending-price auctions, forcing prices to be anonymous may be a significant restriction. In this paper, we embark on a systematic analysis of the computational power of iterative auctions that are based on demand queries. We do not aim to present auctions for practical use but rather to understand the limitations and possibilities of these kinds of auctions. In the first part of this paper, our main question is what can be done using a polynomial number of these types of queries? That is, polynomial in the main parameters of the problem: n, m and the number of bits t needed for representing a single value vi(S). Note that from an algorithmic point of view we are talking about sub-linear time algorithms: the input size here is really n(2m − 1) numbers - the descriptions of the valuation functions of all bidders. There are two aspects to computational efficiency in these settings: the first is the communication with the bidders, i.e., the number of queries made, and the second is the usual computational tractability. Our lower bounds will depend only on the number of queriesand hold independently of any computational assumptions like P = NP. Our upper bounds will always be computationally efficient both in terms of the number of queries and in terms of regular computation. As mentioned, this paper concentrates on the single aspect of preference elicitation and on its computational consequences and does not address issues of incentives. This strengthens our lower bounds, but means that the upper bounds require evaluation from this perspective also before being used in any real combinatorial auction.1 The second part of this paper studies the power of ascending -price auctions. Ascending auctions are iterative auctions where the published prices cannot decrease in time. In this work, we try to systematically analyze what do the differences between various models of ascending auctions mean. We try to answer the following questions: (i) Which models of ascending auctions can find the optimal allocation, and for which classes of valuations? (ii) In cases where the optimal allocation cannot be determined by ascending auctions, how well can such auctions approximate the social welfare? (iii) How do the different models for ascending auctions compare? Are some models computationally stronger than others? Ascending auctions have been extensively studied in the literature (see the recent survey by Parkes [35]). Most of this work presented upper bounds, i.e., proposed mechanisms with ascending prices and analyzed their properties. A result which is closer in spirit to ours, is by Gul and Stacchetti [17], who showed that no item-price ascending auction can always determine the VCG prices, even for substitutes valuations.2 Our framework is more general than the traditional line of research that concentrates on the final allocation and 1 We do observe however that some weak incentive property comes for free in demand-query auctions since myopic players will answer all demand queries truthfully. We also note that in some cases (but not always!) the incentives issues can be handled orthogonally to the preference elicitation issues, e.g., by using Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) prices (e.g., [4, 34]). 2 We further discuss this result in Section 5.3.

A Walrasian equilibrium3 is known to exist in the case of Substitutes valuations, and is known to be impossible for any wider class of valuations [16]. This does not rule out other allocations by ascending auctions: in this paper we view the auctions as a computational process where the outcome - both the allocation and the payments - can be determined according to all the data elicited throughout the auction; This general framework strengthens our negative results.4 We find the study of ascending auctions appealing for various reasons. First, ascending auctions are widely used in many real-life settings from the FCC spectrum auctions [15] to almost any e-commerce website (e.g., [2, 1]). Actually, this is maybe the most straightforward way to sell items: ask the bidders what would they like to buy under certain prices, and increase the prices of over-demanded goods. Ascending auctions are also considered more intuitive for many bidders, and are believed to increase the trust of the bidders in the auctioneer, as they see the result gradually emerging from the bidders responses. Ascending auctions also have other desired economic properties, e.g., they incur smaller information revelation (consider, for example, English auctions vs. second-price sealed bid auctions). 1.1 Extant Work Many iterative combinatorial auction mechanisms rely on demand queries (see the survey in [35]). Figure 1 summa3 A Walrasian equilibrium is vector of item prices for which all the items are sold when each bidder receives a bundle in his demand set. 4 In few recent auction designs (e.g., [4, 28]) the payments are not necessarily the final prices of the auctions. 30 Valuation family Upper bound Reference Lower bound Reference General min(n, O( √ m)) [26], Section 4.2 min(n, m1/2− ) [32] Substitutes 1 [32] Submodular 2 [25], 1+ 1 2m , 1-1 e (*) [32],[23] Subadditive O(logm) [13] 2 [13] k-duplicates O(m1/k+1 ) [14] O(m1/k+1 ) [14] Procurement ln m [32] (log m)/2 [29, 32] Figure 2: The best approximation factors currently achievable by computationally-efficient combinatorial auctions, for several classes of valuations. All lower bounds in the table apply to all iterative auctions (except the one marked by *); all upper bounds in the table are achieved with item-price demand queries. rizes the basic classes of auctions implied by combinations of the above properties and classifies some of the auctions proposed in the literature according to this classification. For our purposes, two families of these auctions serve as the main motivating starting points: the first is the ascending item-price auctions of [22, 17] that with computational efficiency find an optimal allocation among (gross) substitutes valuations, and the second is the ascending bundleprice auctions of [37, 3] that find an optimal allocation among general valuations - but not necessarily with computational efficiency. The main lower bound in this area, due to [32], states that indeed, due to inherent communication requirements, it is not possible for any iterative auction to find the optimal allocation among general valuations with sub-exponentially many queries. A similar exponential lower bound was shown in [32] also for even approximating the optimal allocation to within a factor of m1/2− . Several lower bounds and upper bounds for approximation are known for some natural classes of valuations - these are summarized in Figure 2. In [32], the universal generality of demand queries is also shown: any non-deterministic communication protocol for finding an allocation that optimizes the social welfare can be converted into one that only uses demand queries (with bundle prices). In [41] this was generalized also to nondeterministic protocols for finding allocations that satisfy other natural types of economic requirements (e.g., approximate social efficiency, envy-freeness). However, in [33] it was demonstrated that this completeness of demand queries holds only in the nondeterministic setting, while in the usual deterministic setting, demand queries (even with bundle prices) may be exponentially weaker than general communication. Bundle-price auctions are a generalization of (the more natural and intuitive) item-price auctions. It is known that indeed item-price auctions may be exponentially weaker: a nice example is the case of valuations that are a XOR of k bundles5 , where k is small (say, polynomial). Lahaie and Parkes [24] show an economically-efficient bundle-price auction that uses a polynomial number of queries whenever k is polynomial. In contrast, [7] show that there exist valuations that are XORs of k = √ m bundles such that any item-price auction that finds an optimal allocation between them requires exponentially many queries. These results are part of a recent line of research ([7, 43, 24, 40]) that study the preference elicitation problem in combinatorial auctions and its relation to the full elicitation problem (i.e., learn5 These are valuations where bidders have values for k specific packages, and the value of each bundle is the maximal value of one of these packages that it contains. ing the exact valuations of the bidders). These papers adapt methods from machine-learning theory to the combinatorialauction setting. The preference elicitation problem and the full elicitation problem relate to a well studied problem in microeconomics known as the integrability problem (see, e.g., [27]). This problem studies if and when one can derive the utility function of a consumer from her demand function. Paper organization: Due to the relatively large number of results we present, we start with a survey of our new results in Section 2. After describing our formal model in Section 3, we present our results concerning the power of demand queries in Section 4. Then, we describe the power of item-price ascending auctions (Section 5) and bundle-price ascending auctions (Section 6). Readers who are mainly interested in the self-contained discussion of ascending auctions can skip Section 4. Missing proofs from Section 4 can be found in part I of the full paper ([8]). Missing proofs from Sections 5 and 6 can be found in part II of the full paper ([9]). 2. A SURVEY OF OUR RESULTS Our systematic analysis is composed of the combination of a rather large number of results characterizing the power and limitations of various classes of auctions. In this section, we will present an exposition describing our new results. We first discuss the power of demand-query iterative auctions, and then we turn our attention to ascending auctions. Figure 3 summarizes some of our main results. 2.1 Demand Queries Comparison of query types We first ask what other natural types of queries could we imagine iterative auctions using? Here is a list of such queries that are either natural, have been used in the literature, or that we found useful. 1. Value query: The auctioneer presents a bundle S, the bidder reports his value v(S) for this bundle. 2. Marginal-value query: The auctioneer presents a bundle A and an item j, the bidder reports how much he is willing to pay for j, given that he already owns A, i.e., v(j|A) = v(A ∪ {j}) − v(A). 3. Demand query (with item prices): The auctioneer presents a vector of item prices p1...pm; the bidder reports his demand under these prices, i.e., some set S that maximizes v(S) − P i∈S pi.6 6 A tie breaking rule should be specified.

Indirect-utility query: The auctioneer presents a set of item prices p1...pm, and the bidder responds with his indirect-utility under these prices, that is, the highest utility he can achieve from a bundle under these prices: maxS⊆M (v(S) − P i∈S pi).7 5. Relative-demand query: the auctioneer presents a set of non-zero prices p1...pm, and the bidder reports the bundle that maximizes his value per unit of money, i.e., some set that maximizes v(S)P i∈S pi .8 Theorem: Each of these queries can be efficiently (i.e., in time polynomial in n, m, and the number of bits of precision t needed to represent a single value vi(S)) simulated by a sequence of demand queries with item prices. In particular this shows that demand queries can elicit all information about a valuation by simulating all 2m −1 value queries. We also observe that value queries and marginalvalue queries can simulate each other in polynomial time and that demand queries and indirect-utility queries can also simulate each other in polynomial time. We prove that exponentially many value queries may be needed in order to simulate a single demand query. It is interesting to note that for the restricted class of substitutes valuations, demand queries may be simulated by polynomial number of value queries [6]. Welfare approximation The next question that we ask is how well can a computationally-efficient auction that uses only demand queries approximate the optimal allocation? Two separate obstacles are known: In [32], a lower bound of min(n, m1/2− ), for any fixed > 0, was shown for the approximation factor apply for any fixed tie breaking rule. 7 This is exactly the utility achieved by the bundle which would be returned in a demand query with the same prices. This notion relates to the Indirect-utility function studied in the Microeconomic literature (see, e.g., [27]). 8 Note that when all the prices are 1, the bidder actually reports the bundle with the highest per-item price. We found this type of query useful, for example, in the design of the approximation algorithm described in Figure 5 in Section 4.2. obtained using any polynomial amount of communication. A computational bound with the same value applies even for the case of single-minded bidders, but under the assumption of NP = ZPP [39]. As noted in [32], the computationallyefficient greedy algorithm of [26] can be adapted to become a polynomial-time iterative auction that achieves a nearly matching approximation factor of min(n, O( √ m)). This iterative auction may be implemented with bundle-price demand queries but, as far as we see, not as one with item prices. Since in a single bundle-price demand query an exponential number of prices can be presented, this algorithm can have an exponential communication cost. In Section 4.2, we describe a different item-price auction that achieves the same approximation factor with a polynomial number of queries (and thus with a polynomial communication). Theorem: There exists a computationally-efficient iterative auction with item-price demand queries that finds an allocation that approximates the optimal welfare between arbitrary valuations to within a factor of min(n, O( √ m)). One may then attempt obtaining such an approximation factor using iterative auctions that use only the weaker value queries. However, we show that this is impossible: Theorem: Any iterative auction that uses a polynomial (in n and m) number of value queries can not achieve an approximation factor that is better than O( m log m ).9 Note however that auctions with only value queries are not completely trivial in power: the bundling auctions of Holzman et al. [19] can easily be implemented by a polynomial number of value queries and can achieve an approximation factor of O( m√ log m ) by using O(log m) equi-sized bundles. We do not know how to close the (tiny) gap between this upper bound and our lower bound. Representing bundle-prices We then deal with a critical issue with bundle-price auctions that was side-stepped by our model, as well as by all previous works that used bundle-price auctions: how are 9 This was also proven independently by Shahar Dobzinski and Michael Schapira. 32 the bundle prices represented? For item-price auctions this is not an issue since a query needs only to specify a small number, m, of prices. In bundle-price auctions that situation is more difficult since there are exponentially many bundles that require pricing. Our basic model (like all previous work that used bundle prices, e.g., [37, 34, 3]), ignores this issue, and only requires that the prices be determined, somehow, by the protocol. A finer model would fix a specific language for denoting bundle prices, force the protocol to represent the bundle-prices in this language, and require that the representations of the bundle-prices also be polynomial. What could such a language for denoting prices for all bundles look like? First note that specifying a price for each bundle is equivalent to specifying a valuation. Second, as noted in [31], most of the proposed bidding languages are really just languages for representing valuations, i.e., a syntactic representation of valuations - thus we could use any of them. This point of view opens up the general issue of which language should be used in bundle-price auctions and what are the implications of this choice. Here we initiate this line of investigation. We consider bundle-price auctions where the prices must be given as a XOR-bid, i.e., the protocol must explicitly indicate the price of every bundle whose value is different than that of all of its proper subsets. Note that all bundle-price auctions that do not explicitly specify a bidding language must implicitly use this language or a weaker one, since without a specific language one would need to list prices for all bundles, perhaps except for trivial ones (those with value 0, or more generally, those with a value that is determined by one of their proper subsets.) We show that once the representation length of bundle prices is taken into account (using the XOR-language), bundle-price auctions are no more strictly stronger than item-price auctions. Define the cost of an iterative auction as the total length of the queries and answers used throughout the auction (in the worst case). Theorem: For some class of valuations, bundle price auctions that use the XOR-language require an exponential cost for finding the optimal allocation. In contrast, item-price auctions can find the optimal allocation for this class within polynomial cost.10 This put doubts on the applicability of bundle-price auctions like [3, 37], and it may justify the use of hybrid pricing methods such as Ausubel, Cramton and Milgroms Clock-Proxy auction ([10]). Demand queries and linear programs The winner determination problem in combinatorial auctions may be formulated as an integer program. In many cases solving the linear-program relaxation of this integer program is useful: for some restricted classes of valuations it finds the optimum of the integer program (e.g., substitute valuations [22, 17]) or helps approximating the optimum (e.g., by randomized rounding [13, 14]). However, the linear program has an exponential number of variables. Nisan and Segal [32] observed the surprising fact that despite the ex10 Our proof relies on the sophisticated known lower bounds for constant depth circuits. We were not able to find an elementary proof. ponential number of variables, this linear program may be solved within polynomial communication. The basic idea is to solve the dual program using the Ellipsoid method (see, e.g., [20]). The dual program has a polynomial number of variables, but an exponential number of constraints. The Ellipsoid algorithm runs in polynomial time even on such programs, provided that a separation oracle is given for the set of constraints. Surprisingly, such a separation oracle can be implemented using a single demand query (with item prices) to each of the bidders. The treatment of [32] was somewhat ad-hoc to the problem at hand (the case of substitute valuations). Here we give a somewhat more general form of this important observation. Let us call the following class of linear programs generalized-winner-determination-relaxation (GWDR) LPs: Maximize X i∈N,S⊆M wi xi,S vi(S) s.t. X i∈N, S|j∈S xi,S ≤ qj ∀j ∈ M X S⊆M xi,S ≤ di ∀i ∈ N xi,S ≥ 0 ∀i ∈ N, S ⊆ M The case where wi = 1, di = 1, qj = 1 (for every i, j) is the usual linear relaxation of the winner determination problem. More generally, wi may be viewed as the weight given to bidder is welfare, qj may be viewed as the quantity of units of good j, and di may be viewed as duplicity of the number of bidders of type i. Theorem: Any GWDR linear program may be solved in polynomial time (in n, m, and the number of bits of precision t) using only demand queries with item prices.11 2.2 Ascending Auctions Ascending item-price auctions: It is well known that the item-price ascending auctions of Kelso and Crawford [22] and its variants [12, 16] find the optimal allocation as long as all players valuations have the substitutes property. The obvious question is whether the optimal allocation can be found for a larger class of valuations. Our main result here is a strong negative result: Theorem: There is a 2-item 2-player problem where no ascending item-price auction can find the optimal allocation. This is in contrast to both the power of bundle-price ascending auctions and to the power of general item-price demand queries (see above), both of which can always find the optimal allocation and in fact even provide full preference elicitation. The same proof proves a similar impossibility result for other types of auctions (e.g., descending auctions, non-anonymous auctions). More extension of this result: • Eliciting some classes of valuations requires an exponential number of ascending item-price trajectories. 11 The produced optimal solution will have polynomial support and thus can be listed fully. 33 • At least k − 1 ascending item-price trajectories are needed to elicit XOR formulae with k terms. This result is in some sense tight, since we show that any k-term XOR formula can be fully elicited by k−1 nondeterministic (i.e., when some exogenous teacher instructs the auctioneer on how to increase the prices) ascending auctions.12 We also show that item-price ascending auctions and iterative auctions that are limited to a polynomial number of queries (of any kind, not necessarily ascending) are incomparable in their power: ascending auctions, with small enough increments, can elicit the preferences in cases where any polynomial number of queries cannot. Motivated by several recent papers that studied the relation between eliciting and fully-eliciting the preferences in combinatorial auctions (e.g., [7, 24]), we explore the difference between these problems in the context of ascending auctions. We show that although a single ascending auction can determine the optimal allocation among any number of bidders with substitutes valuations, it cannot fully-elicit such a valuation even for a single bidder. While it was shown in [25] that the set of substitutes valuations has measure zero in the space of general valuations, its dimension is not known, and in particular it is still open whether a polynomial amount of information suffices to describe a substitutes valuation. While our result may be a small step in that direction (a polynomial full elicitation may still be possible with other communication protocols), we note that our impossibility result also holds for valuations in the class OXS defined by [25], valuations that we are able to show have a compact representation. We also give several results separating the power of different models for ascending combinatorial auctions that use item-prices: we prove, not surprisingly, that adaptive ascending auctions are more powerful than oblivious ascending auctions and that non-deterministic ascending auctions are more powerful than deterministic ascending auctions. We also compare different kinds of non-anonymous auctions (e.g., simultaneous or sequential), and observe that anonymous bundle-price auctions and non-anonymous item-price auctions are incomparable in their power. Finally, motivated by Dutch auctions, we consider descending auctions, and how they compare to ascending ones; we show classes of valuations that can be elicited by ascending item-price auctions but not by descending item-price auctions, and vice versa. Ascending bundle-price auctions: All known ascending bundle-price auctions that are able to find the optimal allocation between general valuations (with free disposal) use non-anonymous prices. Anonymous ascending-price auctions (e.g., [42, 21, 37]) are only known to be able to find the optimal allocation among superadditive valuations or few other simple classes ([36]). We show that this is no mistake: Theorem: No ascending auction with anonymous prices can find the optimal allocation between general valuations. 12 Non-deterministic computation is widely used in CS and also in economics (e.g, a Walrasian equilibrium or [38]). In some settings, deterministic and non-deterministic models have equal power (e.g., computation with finite automata). This bound is regardless of the running time, and it also holds for descending auctions and non-deterministic auctions. We strengthen this result significantly by showing that anonymous ascending auctions cannot produce a better than O( √ m) approximation - the approximation ratio that can be achieved with a polynomial number of queries ([26, 32]) and, as mentioned, with a polynomial number of item-price demand queries. The same lower bound clearly holds for anonymous item-price ascending auctions since such auctions can be simulated by anonymous bundle-price ascending auctions. We currently do not have any lower bound on the approximation achievable by non-anonymous item-price ascending auctions. Finally, we study the performance of the existing computationally-efficient ascending auctions. These protocols ([37, 3]) require exponential time in the worst case, and this is unavoidable as shown by [32]. However, we also observe that these auctions, as well as the whole class of similar ascending bundle-price auctions, require an exponential time even for simple additive valuations. This is avoidable and indeed the ascending item-price auctions of [22] can find the optimal allocation for these simple valuations with polynomial communication. 3. THE MODEL 3.1 Discrete Auctions for Continuous Values Our model aims to capture iterative auctions that operate on real-valued valuations. There is a slight technical difficulty here in bridging the gap between the discrete nature of an iterative auction, and the continuous nature of the valuations. This is exactly the same problem as in modeling a simple English auction. There are three standard formal ways to model it: 1. Model the auction as a continuous process and study its trajectory in time. For example, the so-called Japanese auction is basically a continuous model of an English model.13 2. Model the auction as discrete and the valuations as continuously valued. In this case we introduce a parameter and usually require the auction to produce results that are -close to optimal. 3. Model the valuations as discrete. In this case we will assume that all valuations are integer multiples of some small fixed quantity δ, e.g., 1 penny. All communication in this case is then naturally finite. In this paper we use the latter formulation and assume that all values are multiples of some δ. Thus, in some parts of the paper we assume without loss of generality that δ = 1, hence all valuations are integral. Almost all (if not all) of our results can be translated to the other two models with little effort. 3.2 Valuations A single auctioneer is selling m indivisible non-homogeneous items in a single auction, and let M be the set of these 13 Another similar model is the moving knives model in the cake-cutting literature. 34 items and N be the set of bidders. Each one of the n bidders in the auction has a valuation function vi : 2m → {0, δ, 2δ, ..., L}, where for every bundle of items S ⊆ M, vi(S) denotes the value of bidder i for the bundle S and is a multiple of δ in the range 0...L. We will sometimes denote the number of bits needed to represent such values in the range 0...L by t = log L. We assume free disposal, i.e., S ⊆ T implies vi(S) ≤ vi(T) and that vi(∅) = 0 for all bidders. We will mention the following classes of valuations: • A valuation is called sub-modular if for all sets of items A and B we have that v(A ∪ B) + v(A ∩ B) ≤ v(A) + v(B). • A valuation is called super-additive if for all disjoint sets of items A and B we have that v(A∪B) ≥ v(A)+ v(B). • A valuation is called a k-bundle XOR if it can be represented as a XOR combination of at most k atomic bids [30], i.e., if there are at most k bundles Si and prices pi such that for all S, v(S) = maxi|S⊇Si pi. Such valuations will be denoted by v = (S1 : p1) ⊕ (S2 : p2) ⊕ . . . ⊕ (Sk : pk).14 3.3 Iterative Auctions The auctioneer sets up a protocol (equivalently an algorithm), where at each stage of the protocol some information q - termed the query - is sent to some bidder i, and then bidder i replies with some reply that depends on the query as well as on his own valuation. In this paper, we assume that we have complete control over the bidders behavior, and thus the protocol also defines a reply function ri(q, vi) that specifies bidder is reply to query q. The protocol may be adaptive: the query value as well as the queried bidder may depend on the replies received for past queries. At the end of the protocol, an allocation S1...Sn must be declared, where Si ∩ Sj = ∅ for i = j. We say that the auction finds an optimal allocation if it finds the allocation that maximizes the social welfareP i vi(Si). We say that it finds a c-approximation if P i vi(Si) ≥ P i vi(Ti)/c where T1...Tn is an optimal allocation. The running time of the auction on a given instance of the bidders valuations is the total number of queries made on this instance. The running time of a protocol is the worst case cost over all instances. Note that we impose no computational limitations on the protocol or on the players.15 This of course only strengthens our hardness results. Yet, our positive results will not use this power and will be efficient also in the usual computational sense. Our goal will be to design computationally-efficient protocols. We will deem a protocol computationally-efficient if its cost is polynomial in the relevant parameters: the number of bidders n, the number of items m, and t = log L, where L is the largest possible value of a bundle. However, when we discuss ascending-price auctions and their variants, a computationally-efficient protocol will be required to be 14 For example, v = (abcd : 5) ⊕ (ab : 3) ⊕ (c : 4) denotes the XOR valuation with the terms abcd, ab, c and prices 5, 3, 4 respectively. For this valuation, v(abcd) = 5, v(abd) = 3, v(abc) = 4. 15 The running time really measures communication costs and not computational running time. pseudo-polynomial, i.e., it should ask a number of queries which is polynomial in m, n and L δ . This is because that ascending auctions can usually not achieve such running times (consider even the English auction on a single item).16 Note that all of our results give concrete bounds, where the dependence on the parameters is given explicitly; we use the standard big-Oh notation just as a shorthand. We say than an auction elicits some class V of valuations, if it determines the optimal allocation for any profile of valuations drawn from V ; We say that an auction fully elicits some class of valuations V , if it can fully learn any single valuation v ∈ V (i.e., learn v(S) for every S). 3.4 Demand Queries and Ascending Auctions Most of the paper will be concerned with a common special case of iterative auctions that we term demand auctions. In such auctions, the queries that are sent to bidders are demand queries: the query specifies a price p(S) ∈ + for each bundle S. The reply of bidder i is simply the set most desired - demanded - under these prices. Formally, a set S that maximizes vi(S) − p(S). It may happen that more than one set S maximizes this value. In which case, ties are broken according to some fixed tie-breaking rule, e.g., the lexicographically first such set is returned. All of our results hold for any fixed tie-breaking rule. Ascending auctions are iterative auctions with non-decreasing prices: Definition 1. In an ascending auction, the prices in the queries to the same bidder can only increase in time. Formally, let p be a query made for bidder i, and q be a query made for bidder i at a later stage in the protocol. Then for all sets S, q(S) ≥ p(S). A similar variant, which we also study and that is also common in real life, is descending auctions, in which prices can only decrease in time. Note that the term ascending auction refers to an auction with a single ascending trajectory of prices. It may be useful to define multi-trajectory ascending auctions, in which the prices maybe reset to zero a number of times (see, e.g., [4]). We consider two main restrictions on the types of allowed demand queries: Definition 2. Item Prices: The prices in each query are given by prices pj for each item j. The price of a set S is additive: p(S) = P j∈S pj. Definition 3. Anonymous prices: The prices seen by the bidders at any stage in the auction are the same, i.e. whenever a query is made to some bidder, the same query is also made to all other bidders (with the prices unchanged). In auctions with non-anonymous (discriminatory) prices, each bidder i has personalized prices denoted by pi (S).17 In this paper, all auctions are anonymous unless otherwise specified. Note that even though in our model valuations are integral (or multiples of some δ), we allow the demand query to 16 Most of the auctions we present may be adapted to run in time polynomial in log L, using a binary-search-like procedure, losing their ascending nature. 17 Note that a non-anonymous auction can clearly be simulated by n parallel anonymous auctions. 35 use arbitrary real numbers in +. That is, we assume that the increment we use in the ascending auctions may be significantly smaller than δ. All our hardness results hold for any , even for continuous price increments. A practical issue here is how will the query be specified: in the general case, an exponential number of prices needs to be sent in a single query. Formally, this is not a problem as the model does not limit the length of queries in any way - the protocol must simply define what the prices are in terms of the replies received for previous queries. We look into this issue further in Section 4.3. 4. THE POWER OF DEMAND QUERIES In this section, we study the power of iterative auctions that use demand queries (not necessarily ascending). We start by comapring demand queries to other types of queries. Then, we discuss how well can one approximate the optimal welfare using a polynomial number of demand queries. We also initiate the study of the representation of bundle-price demand queries, and finally, we show how demand queries help solving the linear-programming relaxation of combinatorial auctions in polynomial time. 4.1 The Power of Different Types of Queries In this section we compare the power of the various types of queries defined in Section 2. We will present computationally -efficient simulations of these query types using item-price demand queries. In Section 5.1 we show that these simulations can also be done using item-price ascending auctions. Lemma 4.1. A value query can be simulated by m marginalvalue queries. A marginal-value query can be simulated by two value queries. Lemma 4.2. A value query can be simulated by mt demand queries (where t = log L is the number of bits needed to represent a single bundle value).18 As a direct corollary we get that demand auctions can always fully elicit the bidders valuations by simulating all possible 2m − 1 queries and thus elicit enough information for determining the optimal allocation. Note, however, that this elicitation may be computationally inefficient. The next lemma shows that demand queries can be exponentially more powerful than value queries. Lemma 4.3. An exponential number of value queries may be required for simulating a single demand query. Indirect utility queries are, however, equivalent in power to demand queries: Lemma 4.4. An indirect-utility query can be simulated by mt + 1 demand queries. A demand query can be simulated by m + 1 indirect-utility queries. Demand queries can also simulate relative-demand queries:19 18 Note that t bundle-price demand queries can easily simulate a value query by setting the prices of all the bundles except S (the bundle with the unknown value) to be L, and performing a binary search on the price of S. 19 Note: although in our model values are integral (our multiples of δ), we allow the query prices to be arbitrary real numV MV D IU RD V 1 2 exp exp exp MV m 1 exp exp exp D mt poly 1 mt+1 poly IU 1 2 m+1 1 poly RD - - - - 1 Figure 4: Each entry in the table specifies how many queries of this row are needed to simulate a query from the relevant column. Abbreviations: V (value query), MV (marginal-value query), D (demand query), IU (Indirect-utility query), RD (relative demand query). Lemma 4.5. Relative-demand queries can be simulated by a polynomial number of demand queries. According to our definition of relative-demand queries, they clearly cannot simulate even value queries. Figure 4 summarizes the relations between these query types. 4.2 Approximating the Social Welfare with Value and Demand Queries We know from [32] that iterative combinatorial auctions that only use a polynomial number of queries can not find an optimal allocation among general valuations and in fact can not even approximate it to within a factor better than min{n, m1/2− }. In this section we ask how well can this approximation be done using demand queries with item prices, or using the weaker value queries. We show that, using demand queries, the lower bound can be matched, while value queries can only do much worse. Figure 5 describes a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a min(n, O( √ m)) approximation ratio. This algorithm greedily picks the bundles that maximize the bidders per-item value (using relative-demand queries, see Section 4.1). As a final step, it allocates all the items to a single bidder if it improves the social welfare (this can be checked using value queries). Since both value queries and relative-demand queries can be simulated by a polynomial number of demand queries with item prices (Lemmas 4.2 and 4.5), this algorithm can be implemented by a polynomial number of demand queries with item prices.20 Theorem 4.6. The auction described in Figure 5 can be implemented by a polynomial number of demand queries and achieves a min{n, 4 √ m}-approximation for the social welfare. We now ask how well can the optimal welfare be approximated by a polynomial number of value queries. First we note that value queries are not completely powerless: In [19] it is shown that if the m items are split into k fixed bundles of size m/k each, and these fixed bundles are auctioned as though each was indivisible, then the social welfare bers, thus we may have bundles with arbitrarily close relative demands. In this sense the simulation above is only up to any given (and the number of queries is O(log L+log 1 )). When the relative-demand query prices are given as rational numbers, exact simulation is implied when log is linear in the input length. 20 In the full paper [8], we observe that this algorithm can be implemented by two descending item-price auctions (where we allow removing items along the auction). 36 generated by such an auction is at least m√ k -approximation of that possible in the original auction. Notice that such an auction can be implemented by 2k − 1 value queries to each bidder - querying the value of each bundle of the fixed bundles. Thus, if we choose k = log m bundles we get an m√ log m -approximation while still using a polynomial number of queries. The following lemma shows that not much more is possible using value queries: Lemma 4.7. Any iterative auction that uses only value queries and distinguishes between k-tuples of 0/1 valuations where the optimal allocation has value 1, and those where the optimal allocation has value k requires at least 2 m k queries. Proof. Consider the following family of valuations: for every S, such that |S| > m/2, v(S) = 1, and there exists a single set T, such that for |S| ≤ m/2, v(S) = 1 iff T ⊆ S and v(S) = 0 otherwise. Now look at the behavior of the protocol when all valuations vi have T = {1...m}. Clearly in this case the value of the best allocation is 1 since no set of size m 2 or lower has non-zero value for any player. Fix the sequence of queries and answers received on this k-tuple of valuations. Now consider the k-tuple of valuations chosen at random as follows: a partition of the m items into k sets T1...Tk each of size m k each is chosen uniformly at random among all such partitions. Now consider the k-tuple of valuations from our family that correspond to this partition - clearly Ti can be allocated to i, for each i, getting a total value of k. Now look at the protocol when running on these valuations and compare its behavior to the original case. Note that the answer to a query S to player i differs between the case of Ti and the original case of T = {1...m} only if |S| ≤ m 2 and Ti ⊆ S. Since Ti is distributed uniformly among all sets of size exactly m k , we have that for any fixed query S to player i, where |S| ≤ m 2 , Pr[Ti ⊆ S] ≤ „ |S| m «|Ti| ≤ 2− m k Using the union-bound, if the original sequence of queries was of length less than 2 m k , then with positive probability none of the queries in the sequence would receive a different answer than for the original input tuple. This is forbidden since the protocol must distinguish between this case and the original case - which cannot happen if all queries receive the same answer. Hence there must have been at least 2 m k queries for the original tuple of valuations. We conclude that a polynomial time protocol that uses only value queries cannot obtain a better than O( m log m ) approximation of the welfare: Theorem 4.8. An iterative auction that uses a polynomial number of value queries cannot achieve better than O( m log m )-approximation for the social welfare. Proof. Immediate from Lemma 4.7: achieving any approximation ratio k which is asymptotically greater than m log m needs an exponential number of value queries. An Approximation Algorithm: Initialization: Let T ← M be the current items for sale. Let K ← N be the currently participating bidders. Let S∗ 1 ← ∅, ..., S∗ n ← ∅ be the provisional allocation. Repeat until T = ∅ or K = ∅: Ask each bidder i in K for the bundle Si that maximizes her per-item value, i.e., Si ∈ argmaxS⊆T vi(S) |S| . Let i be the bidder with the maximal per-item value, i.e., i ∈ argmaxi∈K vi(Si) |Si| . Set: s∗ i = si, K = K \\ i, M = M \\ Si Finally: Ask the bidders for their values vi(M) for the grand bundle. If allocating all the items to some bidder i improves the social welfare achieved so far (i.e., ∃i ∈ N such that vi(M) > P i∈N vi(S∗ i )), then allocate all items to this bidder i. Figure 5: This algorithm achieves a min{n, 4 √ m}approximation for the social welfare, which is asymptotically the best worst-case approximation possible with polynomial communication. This algorithm can be implemented with a polynomial number of demand queries. 4.3 The Representation of Bundle Prices In this section we explicitly fix the language in which bundle prices are presented to the bidders in bundle-price auctions. This language requires the algorithm to explicitly list the price of every bundle with a non-trivial price. Trivial in this context is a price that is equal to that of one of its proper subsets (which was listed explicitly). This representation is equivalent to the XOR-language for expressing valuations. Formally, each query q is given by an expression: q = (S1 : p1) ⊕ (S2 : p2) ⊕ ... ⊕ (Sl : pl). In this representation, the price demanded for every set S is simply p(S) = max{k=1...l|Sk⊆S}pk. Definition 4. The length of the query q = (S1 : p1) ⊕ (S2 : p2) ⊕ ... ⊕ (Sl : pl) is l. The cost of an algorithm is the sum of the lengths of the queries asked during the operation of the algorithm on the worst case input. Note that under this definition, bundle-price auctions are not necessarily stronger than item-price auctions. An itemprice query that prices each item for 1, is translated to an exponentially long bundle-price query that needs to specify the price |S| for each bundle S. But perhaps bundle-price auctions can still find optimal allocations whenever itemprice auction can, without directly simulating such queries? We show that this is not the case: indeed, when the representation length is taken into account, bundle price auctions are sometimes seriously inferior to item price auctions. Consider the following family of valuations: Each item is valued at 3, except that for some single set S, its value is a bit more: 3|S| + b, where b ∈ {0, 1, 2}. Note that an item price auction can easily find the optimal allocation between any two such valuations: Set the prices of each item to 3+ ; if the demand sets of the two players are both empty, then b = 0 for both valuations, and an arbitrary allocation is fine. If one of them is empty and the other non-empty, allocate the non-empty demand set to its bidder, and the rest to the other. If both demand sets are non-empty then, unless they form an exact partition, we need to see which b is larger, which we can do by increasing the price of a single item in each demand set. 37 We will show that any bundle-price auction that uses only the XOR-language to describe bundle prices requires an exponential cost (which includes the sum of all description lengths of prices) to find an optimal allocation between any two such valuations. Lemma 4.9. Every bundle-price auction that uses XORexpressions to denote bundle prices requires 2Ω( √ m) cost in order to find the optimal allocation among two valuations from the above family. The complication in the proof stems from the fact that using XOR-expressions, the length of the price description depends on the number of bundles whose price is strictly larger than each of their subsets - this may be significantly smaller than the number of bundles that have a non-zero price. (The proof becomes easy if we require the protocol to explicitly name every bundle with non-zero price.) We do not know of any elementary proof for this lemma (although we believe that one can be found). Instead we reduce the problem to a well known lower bound in boolean circuit complexity [18] stating that boolean circuits of depth 3 that compute the majority function on m variables require 2Ω( √ m) size. 4.4 Demand Queries and Linear Programming Consider the following linear-programming relaxation for the generalized winner-determination problem in combinatorial auctions (the primal program): Maximize X i∈N,S⊆M wi xi,S vi(S) s.t. X i∈N, S|j∈S xi,S ≤ qj ∀j ∈ M X S⊆M xi,S ≤ di ∀i ∈ N xi,S ≥ 0 ∀i ∈ N, S ⊆ M Note that the primal program has an exponential number of variables. Yet, we will be able to solve it in polynomial time using demand queries to the bidders. The solution will have a polynomial size support (non-zero values for xi,S), and thus we will be able to describe it in polynomial time. Here is its dual: Minimize X j∈M qjpj + X i∈N diui s.t. ui + X j∈S pj ≥ wivi(S) ∀i ∈ N, S ⊆ M pi ≥ 0, uj ≥ 0 ∀i ∈ M, j ∈ N Notice that the dual problem has exactly n + m variables but an exponential number of constraints. Thus, the dual can be solved using the Ellipsoid method in polynomial time - if a separation oracle can be implemented in polynomial time. Recall that a separation oracle, when given a possible solution, either confirms that it is a feasible solution, or responds with a constraint that is violated by the possible solution. We construct a separation oracle for solving the dual program, using a single demand query to each of the bidders. Consider a possible solution (u, p) for the dual program. We can re-write the constraints of the dual program as: ui/wi ≥ vi(S) − X j∈S pj/wi Now a demand query to bidder i with prices pj/wi reveals exactly the set S that maximizes the RHS of the previous inequality. Thus, in order to check whether (u, p) is feasible it suffices to (1) query each bidder i for his demand Di under the prices pj/wi; (2) check only the n constraints ui + P j∈Di pj ≥ wivi(Di) (where vi(Di) can be simulated using a polynomial sequence of demand queries as shown in Lemma 4.2). If none of these is violated then we are assured that (u, p) is feasible; otherwise we get a violated constraint. What is left to be shown is how the primal program can be solved. (Recall that the primal program has an exponential number of variables.) Since the Ellipsoid algorithm runs in polynomial time, it encounters only a polynomial number of constraints during its operation. Clearly, if all other constraints were removed from the dual program, it would still have the same solution (adding constraints can only decrease the space of feasible solutions). Now take the reduced dual where only the constraints encountered exist, and look at its dual. It will have the same solution as the original dual and hence of the original primal. However, look at the form of this dual of the reduced dual. It is just a version of the primal program with a polynomial number of variables - those corresponding to constraints that remained in the reduced dual. Thus, it can be solved in polynomial time, and this solution clearly solves the original primal program, setting all other variables to zero. 5. ITEM-PRICE ASCENDING AUCTIONS In this section we characterize the power of ascending item-price auctions. We first show that this power is not trivial: such auctions can in general elicit an exponential amount of information. On the other hand, we show that the optimal allocation cannot always be determined by a single ascending auction, and in some cases, nor by an exponential number of ascending-price trajectories. Finally, we separate the power of different models of ascending auctions. 5.1 The Power of Item-Price Ascending Auctions We first show that if small enough increments are allowed, a single ascending trajectory of item-prices can elicit preferences that cannot be elicited with polynomial communication. As mentioned, all our hardness results hold for any increment, even infinitesimal. Theorem 5.1. Some classes of valuations can be elicited by item-price ascending auctions, but cannot be elicited by a polynomial number of queries of any kind. Proof. (sketch) Consider two bidders with v(S) = 1 if |S| > n 2 , v(S) = 0 if |S| < n 2 and every S such that |S| = n 2 has an unknown value from {0, 1}. Due to [32], determining the optimal allocation here requires exponential communication in the worst case. Nevertheless, we show (see [9]) that an item-price ascending auction can do it, as long as it can use exponentially small increments. We now describe another positive result for the power of item-price ascending auctions. In section 4.1, we showed 38 v(ab) v(a) v(b) Bidder 1 2 α ∈ (0, 1) β ∈ (0, 1) Bidder 2 2 2 2 Figure 6: No item-price ascending auctions can determine the optimal allocation for this class of valuations. that a value query can be simulated with a (truly) polynomial number of item-price demand queries. Here, we show that every value query can be simulated by a (pseudo) polynomial number of ascending item-price demand queries. (In the next subsection, we show that we cannot always simulate even a pair of value queries using a single item-price ascending auction.) In the full paper (part II,[9]), we show that we can simulate other types of queries using item-price ascending auctions. Proposition 5.2. A value query can be simulated by an item-price ascending auction. This simulation requires a polynomial number of queries. Actually, the proof for Proposition 5.2 proves a stronger useful result regarding the information elicited by iterative auctions. It says that in any iterative auction in which the changes of prices are small enough in each stage (pseudocontinuous auctions), the value of all bundles demanded during the auction can be computed. The basic idea is that when the bidder moves from demanding some bundle Ti to demanding another bundle Ti+1, there is a point in which she is indifferent between these two bundles. Thus, knowing the value of some demanded bundle (e.g., the empty set) enables computing the values of all other demanded bundles. We say that an auction is pseudo-continuous, if it only uses demand queries, and in each step, the price of at most one item is changed by (for some ∈ (0, δ]) with respect to the previous query. Proposition 5.3. Consider any pseudo-continuous auction (not necessarily ascending), in which bidder i demands the empty set at least once along the auction. Then, the value of every bundle demanded by bidder i throughout the auction can be calculated at the end of the auction. 5.2 Limitations of Item-Price Ascending Auctions Although we observed that demand queries can solve any combinatorial auction problem, when the queries are restricted to be ascending, some classes of valuations cannot be elicited nor fully-elicited. An example for such class of valuations is given in Figure 6. Theorem 5.4. There are classes of valuations that cannot be elicited nor fully elicited by any item-price ascending auction. Proof. Let bidder 1 have the valuation described in the first row of Figure 6, where α and β are unknown values in (0, 1). First, we prove that this class cannot be fully elicited by a single ascending auction. Specifically, an ascending auction cannot reveal the values of both α and β. As long as pa and pb are both below 1, the bidder will always demand the whole bundle ab: her utility from ab is strictly greater than the utility from either a or b separately. For example, we show that u1(ab) > u1(a): u1(ab) = 2 − (pa + pb) = 1 − pa + 1 − pb > vA(a) − pa + 1 − pb > u1(a) Thus, in order to gain any information about α or β, the price of one of the items should become at least 1, w.l.o.g. pa ≥ 1. But then, the bundle a will not be demanded by bidder 1 throughout the auction, thus no information at all will be gained about α. Now, assume that bidder 2 is known to have the valuation described in the second row of Figure 6. The optimal allocation depends on whether α is greater than β (in bidder 1s valuation), and we proved that an ascending auction cannot determine this. The proof of the theorem above shows that for an unknown value to be revealed, the price of one item should be greater than 1, and the other price should be smaller than 1. Therefore, in a price-monotonic trajectory of prices, only one of these values can be revealed. An immediate conclusion is that this impossibility result also holds for item-price descending auctions. Since no such trajectory exists, then the same conclusion even holds for non-deterministic itemprice auctions (in which exogenous data tells us how to increase the prices). Also note that since the hardness stems from the impossibility to fully-elicit a valuation of a single bidder, this result also holds for non-anonymous ascending item-price auctions. 5.3 Limitations of Multi-Trajectory Ascending Auctions According to Theorem 5.4, no ascending item-price auction can always elicit the preferences (we prove a similar result for bundle prices in section 6). But can two ascending trajectories do the job? Or a polynomial number of ascending trajectories? We give negative answers for such suggestions. We define a k-trajectory ascending auction as a demandquery iterative auction in which the demand queries can be partitioned to k sets of queries, where the prices published in each set only increase in time. Note that we use a general definition; It allows the trajectories to run in parallel or sequentially, and to use information elicited in some trajectories for determining the future queries in other trajectories. The power of multiple-trajectory auctions can be demonstrated by the negative result of Gul and Stacchetti [17] who showed that even for an auction among substitutes valuations, an anonymous ascending item-price auction cannot compute VCG prices for all players.21 Ausubel [4] overcame this impossibility result and designed auctions that do compute VCG prices by organizing the auction as a sequence of n + 1 ascending auctions. Here, we prove that one cannot elicit XOR valuations with k terms by less than k − 1 ascending trajectories. On the other hand, we show that an XOR formula can be fully elicited by k−1 non-deterministic ascending auctions (or by k−1 deterministic ascending auctions if the auctioneer knows the atomic bundles).22 21 A recent unpublished paper by Mishra and Parkes extends this result, and shows that non-anonymous prices with bundle-prices are necessary in order that an ascending auction will end up with a universal-competitive-equilibrium (that leads to VCG payments). 22 This result actually separates the power of deterministic 39 Proposition 5.5. XOR valuations with k terms cannot be elicited (or fully elicited) by any (k-2)-trajectory itemprice ascending auction, even when the atomic bundles are known to the elicitor. However, these valuations can be elicited (and fully elicited) by (k-1)-trajectory non-deterministic non-anonymous item-price ascending auctions. Moreover, an exponential number of trajectories is required for eliciting some classes of valuations: Proposition 5.6. Elicitation and full-elicitation of some classes of valuations cannot be done by any k-trajectory itemprice ascending auction, where k = o(2m ). Proof. (sketch) Consider the following class of valuations: For |S| < m 2 , v(S) = 0 and for |S| > m 2 , v(S) = 2; every bundle S of size m 2 has some unknown value in (0, 1). We show ([9]) that a single item-price ascending auction can reveal the value of at most one bundle of size n 2 , and therefore an exponential number of ascending trajectories is needed in order to elicit such valuations. We observe that the algorithm we presented in Section 4.2 can be implemented by a polynomial number of ascending auctions (each item-price demand query can be considered as a separate ascending auction), and therefore a min(n, 4 √ m)-approximation can be achieved by a polynomial number of ascending auctions. We do not currently have a better upper bound or any lower bound. 5.4 Separating the Various Models of Ascending Auctions Various models for ascending auctions have been suggested in the literature. In this section, we compare the power of the different models. As mentioned, all auctions are considered anonymous and deterministic, unless specified otherwise. Ascending vs. Descending Auctions: We begin the discussion of the relation between ascending auctions and descending auctions with an example. The algorithm by Lehmann, Lehmann and Nisan [25] can be implemented by a simple item-price descending auction (see the full paper for details [9]). This algorithm guarantees at least half of the optimal efficiency for submodular valuations. However, we are not familiar with any ascending auction that guarantees a similar fraction of the efficiency. This raises a more general question: can ascending auctions solve any combinatorialauction problem that is solvable using a descending auction (and vice versa)? We give negative answers to these questions. The idea behind the proofs is that the information that the auctioneer can get for free at the beginning of each type of auction is different.23 and non-deterministic iterative auctions: our proof shows that a non-deterministic iterative auction can elicit the kterm XOR valuations with a polynomial number of demand queries, and [7] show that this elicitation must take an exponential number of demand queries. 23 In ascending auctions, the auctioneer can reveal the most valuable bundle (besides M) before she starts raising the prices, thus she can use this information for adaptively choose the subsequent queries. In descending auctions, one can easily find the bundle with the highest average per-item price, keeping all other bundles with non-positive utilities, and use this information in the adaptive price change. Proposition 5.7. There are classes that cannot be elicited (fully elicited) by ascending item-price auctions, but can be elicited (resp. fully elicited) with a descending item-price auction. Proposition 5.8. There are classes that cannot be elicited (fully elicited) by item-price descending auctions, but can be elicited (resp. fully elicited) by item-price ascending auctions. Deterministic vs. Non-Deterministic Auctions: Nondeterministic ascending auctions can be viewed as auctions where some benevolent teacher that has complete information guides the auctioneer on how she should raise the prices. That is, preference elicitation can be done by a non-deterministic ascending auction, if there is some ascending trajectory that elicits enough information for determining the optimal allocation (and verifying that it is indeed optimal). We show that non-deterministic ascending auctions are more powerful than deterministic ascending auctions: Proposition 5.9. Some classes can be elicited (fully elicited) by an item-price non-deterministic ascending auction, but cannot be elicited (resp. fully elicited) by item-price deterministic ascending auctions. Anonymous vs. Non-Anonymous Auctions: As will be shown in Section 6, the power of anonymous and nonanonymous bundle-price ascending auctions differs significantly. Here, we show that a difference also exists for itemprice ascending auctions. Proposition 5.10. Some classes cannot be elicited by anonymous item-price ascending auctions, but can be elicited by a non-anonymous item-price ascending auction. Sequential vs. Simultaneous Auctions: A non-anonymous auction is called simultaneous if at each stage, the price of some item is raised by for every bidder. The auctioneer can use the information gathered until each stage, in all the personalized trajectories, to determine the next queries. A non-anonymous auction is called sequential if the auctioneer performs an auction for each bidder separately, in sequential order. The auctioneer can determine the next query based on the information gathered in the trajectories completed so far and on the history of the current trajectory. Proposition 5.11. There are classes that cannot be elicited by simultaneous non-anonymous item-price ascending auctions, but can be elicited by a sequential non-anonymous item-price ascending auction. Adaptive vs. Oblivious Auctions: If the auctioneer determines the queries regardless of the bidders responses (i.e., the queries are predefined) we say that the auction is oblivious. Otherwise, the auction is adaptive. We prove that an adaptive behaviour of the auctioneer may be beneficial. Proposition 5.12. There are classes that cannot be elicited (fully elicited) using oblivious item-price ascending auctions, but can be elicited (resp. fully elicited) by an adaptive item-price ascending auction. 40 5.5 Preference Elicitation vs. Full Elicitation Preference elicitation and full elicitation are closely related problems. If full elicitation is easy (e.g., in polynomial time) then clearly elicitation is also easy (by a nonanonymous auction, simply by learning all the valuations separately24 ). On the other hand, there are examples where preference elicitation is considered easy but learning is hard (typically, elicitation requires smaller amount of information; some examples can be found in [7]). The tatonnement algorithms by [22, 12, 16] end up with the optimal allocation for substitutes valuations.25 We prove that we cannot fully elicit substitutes valuations (or even their sub-class of OXS valuations defined in [25]), even for a single bidder, by an item-price ascending auction (although the optimal allocation can be found by an ascending auction for any number of bidders!). Theorem 5.13. Substitute valuations cannot be fully elicited by ascending item-price auctions. Moreover, they cannot be fully elicited by any m 2 ascending trajectories (m > 3). Whether substitutes valuations have a compact representation (i.e., polynomial in the number of goods) is an important open question. As a step in this direction, we show that its sub-class of OXS valuations does have a compact representation: every OXS valuation can be represented by at most m2 values.26 Lemma 5.14. Any OXS valuation can be represented by no more than m2 values. 6. BUNDLE-PRICE ASCENDING AUCTIONS All the ascending auctions in the literature that are proved to find the optimal allocation for unrestricted valuations are non-anonymous bundle-price auctions (iBundle(3) by Parkes and Ungar [37] and the Proxy Auction by Ausubel and Milgrom [3]). Yet, several anonymous ascending auctions have been suggested (e.g., AkBA [42], [21] and iBundle(2) [37]). In this section, we prove that anonymous bundle-price ascending auctions achieve poor results in the worst-case. We also show that the family of non-anonymous bundleprice ascending auctions can run exponentially slower than simple item-price ascending auctions. 6.1 Limitations of Anonymous Bundle-Price Ascending Auctions We present a class of valuations that cannot be elicited by anonymous bundle-price ascending auctions. These valuations are described in Figure 7. The basic idea: for determining some unknown value of one bidder we must raise 24 Note that an anonymous ascending auction cannot necessarily elicit a class that can be fully elicited by an ascending auction. 25 Substitute valuations are defined, e.g., in [16]. Roughly speaking, a bidder with a substitute valuation will continue demand a certain item after the price of some other items was increased. For completeness, we present in the full paper [9] a proof for the efficiency of such auctions for substitutes valuations. 26 A unit-demand valuation is an XOR valuation in which all the atomic bundles are singletons. OXS valuations can be interpreted as an aggregation (OR) of any number of unit-demand bidders. Bid. 1 v1(ac) = 2 v1(bd) = 2 v1(cd) = α ∈ (0, 1) Bid. 2 v2(ab) = 2 v2(cd) = 2 v2(bd) = β ∈ (0, 1) Figure 7: Anonymous ascending bundle-price auctions cannot determine the optimal allocation for this class of valuations. a price of a bundle that should be demanded by the other bidder in the future. Theorem 6.1. Some classes of valuations cannot be elicited by anonymous bundle-price ascending auctions. Proof. Consider a pair of XOR valuations as described in Figure 7. For finding the optimal allocation we must know which value is greater between α and β.27 However, we cannot learn the value of both α and β by a single ascending trajectory: assume w.l.o.g. that bidder 1 demands cd before bidder 2 demands bd (no information will be elicited if none of these happens). In this case, the price for bd must be greater than 1 (otherwise, bidder 1 prefers bd to cd). Thus, bidder 2 will never demand the bundle bd, and no information will be elicited about β. The valuations described in the proof of Theorem 6.1 can be easily elicited by a non-anonymous item-price ascending auction. On the other hand, the valuations in Figure 6 can be easily elicited by an anonymous bundle-price ascending auction. We conclude that the power of these two families of ascending auctions is incomparable. We strengthen the impossibility result above by showing that anonymous bundle-price auctions cannot even achieve better than a min{O(n), O( √ m)}-approximation for the social welfare. This approximation ratio can be achieved with polynomial communication, and specifically with a polynomial number of item-price demand queries.28 Theorem 6.2. An anonymous bundle-price ascending auction cannot guarantee better than a min{ n 2 , √ m 2 } approximation for the optimal welfare. Proof. (Sketch) Assume we have n bidders and n2 items for sale, and that n is prime. We construct n2 distinct bundles with the following properties: for each bidder, we define a partition Si = (Si 1, ..., Si n) of the n2 items to n bundles, such that any two bundles from different partitions intersect. In the full paper, part II [9] we show an explicit construction using the properties of linear functions over finite fields. The rest of the proof is independent of the specific construction. Using these n2 bundles we construct a hard-to-elicit class. Every bidder has an atomic bid, in his XOR valuation, for each of these n2 bundles. A bidder i has a value of 2 for any bundle Si j in his partition. For all bundles in the other partitions, he has a value of either 0 or of 1 − δ, and these values are unknown to the auctioneer. Since every pair of bundles from different partitions intersect, only one bidder can receive a bundle with a value of 2. 27 If α > β, the optimal allocation will allocate cd to bidder 1 and ab to bidder 2. Otherwise, we give bd to bidder 2 and ac to bidder 1. Note that both bidders cannot gain a value of 2 in the same allocation, due to the intersections of the high-valued bundles. 28 Note that bundle-price queries may use exponential communication, thus the lower bound of [32] does not hold. 41 Non-anonymous Bundle-Price Economically-Efficient Ascending Auctions: Initialization: All prices are initialized to zero (non-anonymous bundle prices). Repeat: - Each bidder submits a bundle that maximizes his utility under his current personalized prices. - The auctioneer calculates a provisional allocation that maximizes his revenue under the current prices. - The prices of bundles that were demanded by losing bidders are increased by . Finally: Terminate when the provisional allocation assigns to each bidder the bundle he demanded. Figure 8: Auctions from this family (denoted by NBEA auctions) are known to achieve the optimal welfare. No bidder will demand a low-valued bundle, as long as the price of one of his high-valued bundles is below 1 (and thus gain him a utility greater than 1). Therefore, for eliciting any information about the low-valued bundles, the auctioneer should first arbitrarily choose a bidder (w.l.o.g bidder 1) and raise the prices of all the bundles (S1 1 , ..., S1 n) to be greater than 1. Since the prices cannot decrease, the other bidders will clearly never demand these bundles in future stages. An adversary may choose the values such that the low values of all the bidders for the bundles not in bidder 1s partition are zero (i.e., vi(S1 j ) = 0 for every i = 1 and every j), however, allocating each bidder a different bundle from bidder 1s partition, might achieve a welfare of n+1−(n−1)δ (bidder 1s valuation is 2, and 1 − δ for all other bidders); If these bundles were wrongly allocated, only a welfare of 2 might be achieved (2 for bidder 1s high-valued bundle, 0 for all other bidders). At this point, the auctioneer cannot have any information about the identity of the bundles with the non-zero values. Therefore, an adversary can choose the values of the bundles received by bidders 2, ..., n in the final allocation to be zero. We conclude that anonymous bundleprice auctions cannot guarantee a welfare greater than 2 for this class, where the optimal welfare can be arbitrarily close to n + 1. 6.2 Bundle Prices vs. Item Prices The core of the auctions in [37, 3] is the scheme described in Figure 8 (in the spirit of [35]) for auctions with nonanonymous bundle prices. Auctions from this scheme end up with the optimal allocation for any class of valuations. We denote this family of ascending auctions as NBEA auctions29 . NBEA auctions can elicit k-term XOR valuations by a polynomial (in k) number of steps , although the elicitation of such valuations may require an exponential number of item-price queries ([7]), and item-price ascending auctions cannot do it at all (Theorem 5.4). Nevertheless, we show that NBEA auctions (and in particular, iBundle(3) and the proxy auction) are sometimes inferior to simple item-price demand auctions. This may justify the use of hybrid auctions that use both linear and non-linear prices (e.g., the clock-proxy auction [10]). We show that auctions from this 29 Non-anonymous Bundle-price economically Efficient Ascending auctions. For completeness, we give in the full paper [9] a simple proof for the efficiency (up to an ) of auctions of this scheme . family may use an exponential number of queries even for determining the optimal allocation among two bidders with additive valuations30 , where such valuations can be elicited by a simple item-price ascending auction. We actually prove this property for a wider class of auctions we call conservative auctions. We also observe that in conservative auctions, allowing the bidders to submit all the bundles in their demand sets ensures that the auction runs a polynomial number of steps - if L is not too high (but with exponential communication, of course). An ascending auction is called conservative if it is nonanonymous, uses bundle prices initialized to zero and at every stage the auctioneer can only raise prices of bundles demanded by the bidders until this stage. In addition, each bidder can only receive bundles he demanded during the auction. Note that NBEA auctions are by definition conservative. Proposition 6.3. If every bidder demands a single bundle in each step of the auction, conservative auctions may run for an exponential number of steps even for additive valuations. If the bidders are allowed to submit all the bundles in their demand sets in each step, then conservative auctions can run in a polynomial number of steps for any profile of valuations, as long as the maximal valuation L is polynomial in m, n and 1 δ .

Introducción Las subastas combinatorias han recibido recientemente mucha atención. En una subasta combinatoria, un conjunto de artículos no idénticos se vende en una sola subasta a N postores competidores. Los postores tienen preferencias con respecto a los paquetes de artículos que pueden recibir. Las preferencias del postor i se especifican mediante una función de valoración VI: 2m → R+, donde vi (s) denota el valor que el postor que adjunta a ganar el paquete de elementos S. Asumimos la eliminación gratuita, es decir, que los vises son monótonos no monótonos-decreciente. El objetivo habitual del subastador es optimizar el bienestar social P i vi (Si), donde la asignación S1 ... Sn debe ser una partición de los artículos. Las aplicaciones incluyen muchos problemas de asignación de recursos complejos y, de hecho, las subastas combinatorias pueden verse como la abstracción común de muchos problemas complejos de asignación de recursos. Las subastas combinatorias enfrentan dificultades económicas y computacionales y son un problema central en la frontera recientemente activa de la teoría económica y la informática. Un próximo libro [11] aborda muchos de los problemas involucrados en el diseño e implementación de subastas combinatorias. El diseño de una subasta combinatoria implica muchas consideraciones. En este artículo nos centramos en un solo tema central: la comunicación entre los postores y el mecanismo de asignación: la obtención de preferencias. La transferencia de toda la información sobre las preferencias de los licitantes requiere una cantidad de comunicación involuntaria (exponencial en M). Por lo tanto, las subastas directas de revelación en las que los postores simplemente declaran sus preferencias al mecanismo solo son prácticas para tamaños de subasta muy pequeños o para familias muy limitadas de preferencias de postor. Por lo tanto, hemos visto una multitud de subastas iterativas sugeridas en las que el protocolo de subastas interactúa repetidamente con los diferentes postores, con el objetivo de obtener suficiente información sobre las preferencias de los licitantes para poder encontrar una asignación buena (óptima o cercana a óptima). La mayoría de las subastas iterativas sugeridas continúan manteniendo precios temporales para los paquetes de artículos y consultando repetidamente a los postores en cuanto a sus preferencias entre los paquetes bajo el conjunto actual de precios, y luego actualizando el conjunto de precios de paquetes de acuerdo con las respuestas recibidas (p. Ej., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]). Efectivamente, una subasta iterativa accede a las preferencias de los licitadores al hacer repetidamente el siguiente tipo de consulta de demanda a los postores: consulta al postor i: un vector de precios de paquete p = {p (s)} s⊆m;Respuesta: Un paquete de artículos s ⊆ m que maximiza VI (S) - P (S). Estos tipos de consultas son muy naturales en un entorno económico, ya que capturan las preferencias reveladas de los postores. Algunas subastas, llamadas subastas de precio de artículo o precio lineal, especifican un precio PI para cada artículo, y el precio de cualquier paquete dado es siempre lineal, p (s) = p i∈S pi. Otras subastas, llamadas subastas de precio de paquete, permiten especificar precios arbitrarios (no lineales) P (s) para paquetes. Otra diferenciación importante entre los modelos de subastas iterativas es 29 basada en si usan precios anónimos o no anónimos: en algunas subastas, los precios que se presentan a los licitadores son siempre los mismos (precios anónimos). En otras subastas (no anónimas), los diferentes postores pueden enfrentar diferentes vectores (discriminatorios) de los precios. En las subastas de precio ascendente, obligar a los precios a ser anónimos puede ser una restricción significativa. En este artículo, nos embarcamos en un análisis sistemático del poder computacional de las subastas iterativas que se basan en las consultas de la demanda. No tenemos como objetivo presentar subastas para uso práctico, sino comprender las limitaciones y posibilidades de este tipo de subastas. En la primera parte de este documento, nuestra pregunta principal es ¿qué se puede hacer utilizando un número polinomial de estos tipos de consultas? Es decir, polinomio en los parámetros principales del problema: N, M y el número de bits T necesarios para representar un solo valor VI (s). Tenga en cuenta que desde un punto de vista algorítmico estamos hablando de algoritmos de tiempo sublineales: el tamaño de entrada aquí es realmente n (2m - 1) números: las descripciones de las funciones de valoración de todos los postores. Hay dos aspectos de la eficiencia computacional en estos entornos: el primero es la comunicación con los postores, es decir, el número de consultas realizadas, y la segunda es la tractabilidad computacional habitual. Nuestros límites inferiores dependerán solo del número de consultas y se mantendrán independientemente de cualquier suposición computacional como P = NP. Nuestros límites superiores siempre serán computacionalmente eficientes tanto en términos del número de consultas como en términos de cálculo regular. Como se mencionó, este documento se concentra en el aspecto único de la obtención de preferencias y en sus consecuencias computacionales y no aborda los problemas de los incentivos. Esto fortalece nuestros límites inferiores, pero significa que los límites superiores requieren evaluación desde esta perspectiva también antes de ser utilizados en cualquier subasta combinatoria real.1 La segunda parte de este documento estudia el poder de las subastas de precio ascendente. Las subastas ascendentes son subastas iterativas donde los precios publicados no pueden disminuir en el tiempo. En este trabajo, tratamos de analizar sistemáticamente qué significan las diferencias entre varios modelos de subastas ascendentes. Intentamos responder a las siguientes preguntas: (i) ¿Qué modelos de subastas ascendentes pueden encontrar la asignación óptima y para qué clases de valoraciones?(ii) En los casos en que la asignación óptima no se puede determinar mediante subastas ascendentes, ¿qué tan bien pueden tales subastas aproximar el bienestar social?(iii) ¿Cómo se comparan los diferentes modelos para subastas ascendentes? ¿Algunos modelos son computacionalmente más fuertes que otros? Las subastas ascendentes se han estudiado ampliamente en la literatura (ver la encuesta reciente de Parkes [35]). La mayor parte de este trabajo presentó límites superiores, es decir, mecanismos propuestos con precios ascendentes y analizó sus propiedades. Un resultado que está más cercano en espíritu para el nuestro, es de Gul y Stacchetti [17], quien demostró que ninguna subasta ascendente de precio de artículos siempre puede determinar los precios de VCG, incluso para las valoraciones de los sustitutos.2 Nuestro marco es más general que la línea tradicional de la línea tradicionalSin embargo, de la investigación que se concentra en la asignación final y 1 observamos que una propiedad de incentivos débiles se produce de forma gratuita en subastas de demanda, ya que los jugadores miopes responderán todas las consultas de demanda con sinceridad. También observamos que en algunos casos (¡pero no siempre!) Los problemas de incentivos se pueden manejar ortogonalmente a los problemas de obtención de preferencias, por ejemplo, mediante el uso de precios de Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) (por ejemplo, [4, 34]).2 Discutimos más este resultado en la Sección 5.3. Subastas iterativas Subastas de demanda Subastas de precios de artículos anónimos Subastas de precios ascendentes 1 2 3 4 5 6 97 8 10 Figura 1: El diagrama clasifica las siguientes subastas de acuerdo con sus propiedades: (1) La adaptación [12] para Kelso & Crawfords [22 [22] subasta.(2) La subasta proxy [3] por Ausubel y Milgrom.(3) Ibundle (3) por Parkes & Ungar [34].(4) Ibundle (2) por Parkes y Ungar [37].(5) Nuestra adaptación descendente para la acroximación de 2 para valoraciones submodulares por [25] (ver subsección 5.4).(6) Ausubels [4] Subasta para valoraciones de sustitutos.(7) La adaptación de Nisan y Segal [32] de la aproximación O (√ m) por [26].(8) La subasta de ítems duplicada por [5].(9) Subasta para fórmulas de lectura por [43].(10) La subasta AKBA de Wurman & Wellman [42].Pagos y en particular, al alcanzar los equilibrios de la nerasiana o los equilibrios competitivos. Se sabe que un equilibrio de Walrasian3 existe en el caso de las valoraciones de los sustitutos, y se sabe que es imposible para cualquier clase más amplia de valoraciones [16]. Esto no descarta otras asignaciones mediante subastas ascendentes: en este documento vemos las subastas como un proceso computacional donde el resultado, tanto la asignación como los pagos, se puede determinar de acuerdo con todos los datos provocados a lo largo de la subasta;Este marco general fortalece nuestros resultados negativos.4 Encontramos el estudio de las subastas ascendentes que atraen por varias razones. Primero, las subastas ascendentes se usan ampliamente en muchos entornos de la vida real desde las subastas del espectro FCC [15] hasta casi cualquier sitio web de comercio electrónico (por ejemplo, [2, 1]). En realidad, esta es quizás la forma más directa de vender artículos: pregúntele a los postores qué les gustaría comprar bajo ciertos precios y aumentar los precios de los bienes demasiado demandados. Las subastas ascendentes también se consideran más intuitivas para muchos postores, y se cree que aumentan la confianza de los postores en el subastador, ya que ven el resultado que emerge gradualmente de las respuestas de los licitantes. Las subastas ascendentes también tienen otras propiedades económicas deseadas, por ejemplo, incurren en una revelación de información más pequeña (considere, por ejemplo, subastas en inglés versus subastas de ofertas selladas de segundo precio).1.1 Trabajo existente Muchos mecanismos de subasta combinatoria iterativa dependen de las consultas de demanda (ver la encuesta en [35]). Figura 1 Summa3 Un equilibrio de Walrasian es un vector de precios de artículos para los que se venden todos los artículos cuando cada postor recibe un paquete en su conjunto de demanda.4 En pocos diseños de subastas recientes (por ejemplo, [4, 28]) los pagos no son necesariamente los precios finales de las subastas.30 Valoración Familia Referencia superior de referencia de referencia inferior de referencia inferior (N, o (√ m)) [26], sección 4.2 min (n, m1/2-) [32] sustituye 1 [32] submodular 2 [25], 1+ 1 2m, 1-1 E (*) [32], [23] Subadditivo O (Logm) [13] 2 [13] K-Duplicados O (M1/K+ 1) [14] O (M1/K+1) [14] Adquisición Ln M [32] (log m)/2 [29, 32] Figura 2: Los mejores factores de aproximación actualmente logrables por subastas combinatorias computacionalmente eficientes, para varias clases de valoraciones. Todos los límites inferiores en la tabla se aplican a todas las subastas iterativas (excepto la marcada por *);Todos los límites superiores en la tabla se logran con consultas de demanda de precio de elemento.Riza las clases básicas de subastas implicadas por combinaciones de las propiedades anteriores y clasifica algunas de las subastas propuestas en la literatura de acuerdo con esta clasificación. Para nuestros propósitos, dos familias de estas subastas sirven como los principales puntos de partida motivadores: el primero son las subastas ascendentes de precios de elementos de [22, 17] que con eficiencia computacional encuentran una asignación óptima entre las valoraciones (brutas) y la segunda¿Son las subastas ascendentes de compra de bundle de [37, 3] que encuentran una asignación óptima entre las valoraciones generales, pero no necesariamente con la eficiencia computacional? El principal límite inferior en esta área, debido a [32], establece que, de hecho, debido a los requisitos de comunicación inherentes, no es posible que ninguna subasta iterativa encuentre la asignación óptima entre las valoraciones generales con subexplicialmente muchas consultas. Se mostró un límite inferior exponencial similar en [32] también para aproximar incluso la asignación óptima dentro de un factor de M1/2−. Varios límites inferiores y límites superiores para la aproximación son conocidos por algunas clases naturales de valoraciones; estos se resumen en la Figura 2. En [32], también se muestra la generalidad universal de las consultas de demanda: cualquier protocolo de comunicación no determinista para encontrar una asignación que optimice el bienestar social se puede convertir en una que solo use consultas de demanda (con precios de paquete). En [41] esto se generalizó también a protocolos no deterministas para encontrar asignaciones que satisfagan otros tipos naturales de requisitos económicos (por ejemplo, eficiencia social aproximada, envidia de envidia). Sin embargo, en [33] se demostró que esta integridad de las consultas de demanda se mantiene solo en el entorno no determinista, mientras que en el entorno determinista habitual, las consultas de demanda (incluso con los precios del paquete) pueden ser exponencialmente más débiles que la comunicación general. Las subastas de precio de paquete son una generalización de las subastas (más naturales e intuitivas) de precios de elementos. Se sabe que, de hecho, las subastas de precio de ítems pueden ser exponencialmente más débiles: un buen ejemplo es el caso de las valoraciones que son un XOR de K Bundles5, donde K es pequeño (por ejemplo, polinomio). Lahaie y Parkes [24] muestran una subasta económicamente eficiente en el precio que utiliza un número polinomial de consultas cada vez que K es polinomio. Por el contrario, [7] muestran que existen valoraciones que son XORS de K = √ m paquetes de tal manera que cualquier subasta de precio de artículo que encuentre una asignación óptima entre ellos requiere exponencialmente muchas consultas. Estos resultados son parte de una línea de investigación reciente ([7, 43, 24, 40]) que estudian el problema de obtención de preferencias en las subastas combinatorias y su relación con el problema de obtención total (es decir, aprender 5 son las valoraciones en las que los postores tienen valores parak paquetes específicos, y el valor de cada paquete es el valor máximo de uno de estos paquetes que contiene. Estos documentos adaptan los métodos de la teoría de aprendizaje automático hasta el entorno de evaluación combinatoria. El problema de obtención de preferencias y el problema de obtención total se relacionan con un problema bien estudiado en microeconomía conocido como el problema de integrabilidad (ver, por ejemplo, [27]). Este problema estudia si uno puede derivar la función de utilidad de un consumidor de su función de demanda. Organización en papel: debido a la cantidad relativamente grande de resultados que presentamos, comenzamos con una encuesta de nuestros nuevos resultados en la Sección 2. Después de describir nuestro modelo formal en la Sección 3, presentamos nuestros resultados sobre el poder de las consultas de demanda en la Sección 4. Luego, describimos el poder de las subastas ascendentes de precio de ítems (Sección 5) y subastas ascendentes a precio de paquete (Sección 6). Los lectores que están principalmente interesados en la discusión autónoma de las subastas ascendentes pueden omitir la Sección 4. Las pruebas faltantes de la Sección 4 se pueden encontrar en la Parte I del documento completo ([8]). Las pruebas faltantes de las secciones 5 y 6 se pueden encontrar en la Parte II del documento completo ([9]).2. Una encuesta de nuestros resultados, nuestro análisis sistemático se compone de la combinación de una cantidad bastante grande de resultados que caracterizan el poder y las limitaciones de varias clases de subastas. En esta sección, presentaremos una exposición que describe nuestros nuevos resultados. Primero discutimos el poder de las subastas iterativas de la demanda para que, y luego dirigimos nuestra atención a las subastas ascendentes. La Figura 3 resume algunos de nuestros principales resultados.2.1 Comparación de consultas de demanda de tipos de consulta. Primero preguntamos qué otros tipos naturales de consultas podríamos imaginar subastas iterativas usando. Aquí hay una lista de tales consultas que son naturales, se han utilizado en la literatura o que encontramos útiles.1. Consulta de valor: el subastador presenta un paquete, el postor informa su valor V (s) para este paquete.2. Consulta de valor marginal: el subastador presenta un paquete A y un artículo J, el postor informa cuánto está dispuesto a pagar por J, dado que ya posee A, es decir, V (j | a) = V (A ∪ {J}) - V (a).3. Consulta de demanda (con precios de artículos): el subastador presenta un vector de precios de artículos P1 ... PM;El postor informa su demanda bajo estos precios, es decir, algunos conjuntos que maximizan V (S) - P i∈S PI.6 6 Se debe especificar una regla de ruptura de corbata. ¿Todos nuestros resultados 31 La restricción de comunicación puede encontrar una asignación óptima?

Abreviaturas: Poly.(Número/tamaño polinomio), AA (subastas ascendentes).- Significa que no se conoce actualmente nada excepto soluciones triviales.4. Consulta de utilidad indirecta: el subastador presenta un conjunto de precios de artículos P1 ... PM, y el postor responde con su utilidad indirecta bajo estos precios, es decir, la utilidad más alta que puede lograr de un paquete bajo estos precios: maxs⊆M (v (s) - p i∈S pi) .7 5. Consulta de demanda relativa: el subastador presenta un conjunto de precios no cerosos P1 ... PM, y el postor informa el paquete que maximiza su valor por unidad de dinero, es decir, algún conjunto que maximiza V (s) P i∈SPI .8 Teorema: Cada una de estas consultas puede ser eficientemente (es decir, en tiempo polinomial en n, m, y el número de bits de precisión t necesarios para representar un valor único vi (s)) simulado por una secuencia de consultas de demanda conprecios de los artículos. En particular, esto muestra que las consultas de demanda pueden provocar toda la información sobre una valoración simulando todas las consultas de valor 2M -1. También observamos que las consultas de valor y las consultas de valor marginal pueden simularse entre sí en tiempo polinomial y que las consultas de demanda y las consultas de utilidad indirecta también pueden simularse entre sí en tiempo polinomial. Probamos que pueden ser necesarias muchas consultas de valor para simular una consulta de demanda única. Es interesante observar que para la clase restringida de valoraciones de sustitutos, las consultas de demanda pueden simularse por el número polinomial de consultas de valor [6]. Aproximación de bienestar La siguiente pregunta que hacemos es ¿qué tan bien puede una subasta computacionalmente eficiente que usa solo consultas de demanda aproximar la asignación óptima? Se conocen dos obstáculos separados: en [32], se demostró un límite inferior de min (n, m1/2-), para cualquier> 0 fijo, para el factor de aproximación aplicado para cualquier regla de ruptura de corbata fija.7 Esta es exactamente la utilidad lograda por el paquete que se devolvería en una consulta de demanda con los mismos precios. Esta noción se relaciona con la función de utilidad indirecta estudiada en la literatura microeconómica (ver, por ejemplo, [27]).8 Tenga en cuenta que cuando todos los precios son 1, el postor realmente informa el paquete con el precio más alto por ítem. Encontramos este tipo de consulta útil, por ejemplo, en el diseño del algoritmo de aproximación descrito en la Figura 5 en la Sección 4.2.obtenido utilizando cualquier cantidad polinomial de comunicación. Un límite computacional con el mismo valor se aplica incluso para el caso de los postores resueltos, pero bajo la suposición de NP = ZPP [39]. Como se señaló en [32], el algoritmo codicioso de eficiencia computacional de [26] puede adaptarse para convertirse en una subasta iterativa de tiempo polinomial que logra un factor de aproximación casi coincidente de min (N, o (√ m)). Esta subasta iterativa puede implementarse con consultas de demanda de precios de paquete pero, hasta donde vemos, no como una con los precios de los artículos. Dado que en una sola consulta de demanda de precio de paquete se puede presentar un número exponencial de precios, este algoritmo puede tener un costo de comunicación exponencial. En la Sección 4.2, describimos una subasta de precio de ítem diferente que logra el mismo factor de aproximación con un número polinomial de consultas (y por lo tanto con una comunicación polinomial). Teorema: existe una subasta iterativa computacionalmente eficiente con consultas de demanda de precio de elemento que encuentra una asignación que se aproxima al bienestar óptimo entre las valoraciones arbitrarias dentro de un factor de min (n, o (√ m)). Luego, uno puede intentar obtener dicho factor de aproximación utilizando subastas iterativas que usan solo las consultas de valor más débiles. Sin embargo, mostramos que esto es imposible: el teorema: cualquier subasta iterativa que use un polinomio (en n y m) el número de consultas de valor no puede lograr un factor de aproximación que sea mejor que o (m log m) .9 Nota.Con solo las consultas de valor no son completamente triviales de poder: las subastas agrupadas de Holzman et al.[19] se puede implementar fácilmente mediante un número polinomial de consultas de valor y puede lograr un factor de aproximación de O (M√ log m) utilizando paquetes de tamaño Equi de O (log m). No sabemos cómo cerrar la brecha (pequeña) entre este límite superior y nuestro límite inferior. Representando los precios de los paquetes, tratamos con un problema crítico con subastas de precio de paquete que fue robado por nuestro modelo, así como por todos los trabajos anteriores que usaron subastas de precios de paquete: ¿cómo son 9 esto también fue demostrado independientemente por Shahar Dobzinski?y Michael Schapira.32 ¿Los precios del paquete representados? Para las subastas de precios de artículos, esto no es un problema, ya que una consulta solo necesita especificar un pequeño número, M, de precios. En las subastas de precios de paquete, esa situación es más difícil, ya que hay exponencialmente muchos paquetes que requieren precios. Nuestro modelo básico (como todos los trabajos anteriores que usaron precios de paquetes, por ejemplo, [37, 34, 3]), ignora este problema y solo requiere que los precios se determinen, de alguna manera, por el protocolo. Un modelo más fino arreglaría un lenguaje específico para denotar los precios del paquete, obligaría al protocolo a representar los precios de los paquetes en este idioma y requerirá que las representaciones de los precios de los paquetes también sean polinomiosos. ¿Cómo podría ser un idioma así para denotar los precios de todos los paquetes? Primero tenga en cuenta que especificar un precio para cada paquete es equivalente a especificar una valoración. En segundo lugar, como se señaló en [31], la mayoría de los idiomas de licitación propuestos son realmente solo idiomas para representar valoraciones, es decir, una representación sintáctica de las valoraciones, por lo que podríamos usar cualquiera de ellas. Este punto de vista abre el tema general del que debe usarse el lenguaje en las subastas de precio de los paquetes y cuáles son las implicaciones de esta elección. Aquí iniciamos esta línea de investigación. Consideramos subastas de precio de paquete donde los precios deben administrarse como un trasero XOR, es decir, el protocolo debe indicar explícitamente el precio de cada paquete cuyo valor es diferente al de todos sus subconjuntos adecuados. Tenga en cuenta que todas las subastas de precio de paquete que no especifican explícitamente un lenguaje de licitación deben usar implícitamente este idioma o una más débil, ya que sin un idioma específico necesitaría enumerar los precios para todos los paquetes, tal vez excepto los triviales (aquellos con valor 0, o más generalmente, aquellos con un valor determinado por uno de sus subconjuntos adecuados). Mostramos que una vez que se tiene en cuenta la duración de la representación de los precios del paquete (usando el lenguaje XOR), las subastas de precios de paquete no son más estrictamente más fuertes que las subastas de precio de artículos. Defina el costo de una subasta iterativa como la longitud total de las consultas y las respuestas utilizadas durante la subasta (en el peor de los casos). Teorema: para alguna clase de valoraciones, las subastas de precios del paquete que usan el idioma XOR requieren un costo exponencial para encontrar la asignación óptima. Por el contrario, las subastas de precios de artículos pueden encontrar la asignación óptima para esta clase dentro del costo polinomial.10 Esto pone dudas sobre la aplicabilidad de las subastas de precios de paquete como [3, 37], y puede justificar el uso de métodos de precios híbridos comoSubasta de Ausubel, Cramton y Milgroms Clock-Proxy ([10]). Consultas de demanda y programas lineales El problema de determinación del ganador en las subastas combinatorias puede formularse como un programa entero. En muchos casos, la resolución de la relajación del programa lineal de este programa entero es útil: para algunas clases restringidas de valoraciones, encuentra el óptimo del programa entero (por ejemplo, valoraciones sustitutivas [22, 17]) o ayuda a aproximar el óptimo (por ejemplo, porredondeo aleatorio [13, 14]). Sin embargo, el programa lineal tiene un número exponencial de variables. Nisan y Segal [32] observaron el hecho sorprendente de que a pesar del ex10 nuestra prueba se basa en los sofisticados límites inferiores conocidos para circuitos de profundidad constantes. No pudimos encontrar una prueba elemental.Número ponencial de variables, este programa lineal puede resolverse dentro de la comunicación polinomial. La idea básica es resolver el programa dual utilizando el método elipsoide (ver, por ejemplo, [20]). El programa dual tiene un número polinomial de variables, pero un número exponencial de restricciones. El algoritmo elipsoide se ejecuta en tiempo polinomial incluso en dichos programas, siempre que se proporcione un oráculo de separación para el conjunto de restricciones. Sorprendentemente, tal oráculo de separación se puede implementar utilizando una consulta de demanda única (con precios de artículos) a cada uno de los postores. El tratamiento de [32] fue algo ad-hoc para el problema en cuestión (el caso de valoraciones sustitutivas). Aquí damos una forma algo más general de esta importante observación. Llamemos a la siguiente clase de programas lineales de reducción de ganador generalizado (GWDR) LPS: Maximizar x i∈N, S⊆M WI XI, S VI (S) S.T. X i∈N, s | j∈S xi, s ≤ qj ∀j ∈ M x s⊆m xi, s ≤ di ∀i ∈ N xi, s ≥ 0 ∀i ∈ N, s ⊆ m el caso donde wi = 1, 1,Di = 1, QJ = 1 (para cada i, j) es la relajación lineal habitual del problema de determinación del ganador. En términos más generales, WI puede verse como el peso dado al postor es el bienestar, el control de calidad puede verse como la cantidad de unidades de buena j, y DI puede verse como la duplicidad del número de licitadores del tipo I.Teorema: Cualquier programa lineal GWDR puede resolverse en el tiempo polinomial (en N, M, y el número de bits de precisión t) utilizando solo consultas de demanda con los precios de los artículos.11 2.2 Subastas ascendentes Subastas de precios ascendentes: es bien sabido queLas subastas ascendentes de precio de artículos de Kelso y Crawford [22] y sus variantes [12, 16] encuentran la asignación óptima siempre que todas las valoraciones de los jugadores tengan la propiedad de sustitutos. La pregunta obvia es si la asignación óptima se puede encontrar para una clase más grande de valoraciones. Nuestro resultado principal aquí es un fuerte resultado negativo: Teorema: hay un problema de 2 jugadores de 2 ítems en el que ninguna subasta de precio ascendente puede encontrar la asignación óptima. Esto contrasta tanto con el poder de las subastas ascendentes a precios de haz como con el poder de las consultas de demanda de precio general general (ver arriba), las cuales siempre pueden encontrar la asignación óptima y, de hecho, incluso proporcionar una obtención de preferencia completa. La misma prueba demuestra un resultado de imposibilidad similar para otros tipos de subastas (por ejemplo, subastas descendentes, subastas no anónimas). Más extensión de este resultado: • Poner algunas clases de valoraciones requiere un número exponencial de trayectorias de precio de elemento ascendente.11 La solución óptima producida tendrá soporte polinómico y, por lo tanto, se puede enumerar completamente.33 • Al menos K-1 Se necesitan trayectorias de precio de ítem ascendentes para provocar fórmulas XOR con K términos. Este resultado tiene cierto sentido, ya que mostramos que cualquier fórmula XOR K-término puede ser completamente provocada por K-1 no determinista (es decir, cuando algún maestro exógeno instruye al subastador sobre cómo aumentar los precios) subastas ascendentes.Demuestre que las subastas ascendentes de precio de ítems y las subastas iterativas que se limitan a un número polinómico de consultas (de cualquier tipo, no necesariamente ascendentes) son incomparables en su poder: las subastas ascendentes, con incrementos lo suficientemente pequeños, pueden provocar las preferencias en los casos donde cualquiera deEl número polinomial de consultas no puede. Motivado por varios artículos recientes que estudiaron la relación entre provocar y eliminar completamente las preferencias en las subastas combinatorias (por ejemplo, [7, 24]), exploramos la diferencia entre estos problemas en el contexto de las subastas ascendentes. Mostramos que aunque una sola subasta ascendente puede determinar la asignación óptima entre cualquier número de licitadores con valoraciones de sustitutos, no puede eliminar completamente dicha valoración incluso para un solo postor. Si bien se demostró en [25] que el conjunto de valoraciones de sustitutos tiene mide cero en el espacio de valoraciones generales, su dimensión no se conoce, y en particular todavía está abierta si una cantidad polinómica de información es suficiente para describir una valoración de sustitutos. Si bien nuestro resultado puede ser un pequeño paso en esa dirección (una obtención completa de polinomio puede ser posible con otros protocolos de comunicación), observamos que nuestro resultado de imposibilidad también es válido para las valoraciones en la clase de bueyes definidos por [25], las valoraciones que somoscapaz de mostrar tener una representación compacta. También damos varios resultados que separan el poder de los diferentes modelos para subastas combinatorias ascendentes que usan los precios de los elementos: demostramos, como sorprendente, que las subastas ascendentes adaptativas son más poderosas que las subastas ascendentes ajenas y que las subastas ascendentes no deterministas son más poderosas que las deterministas que las deterministasSubastas ascendentes. También comparamos diferentes tipos de subastas no anónimas (por ejemplo, simultáneas o secuenciales), y observamos que las subastas anónimas de precios de paquete y las subastas no anónimas de precios de artículos son incomparables en su poder. Finalmente, motivados por subastas holandesas, consideramos subastas descendentes y cómo se comparan con las ascendentes;Mostramos clases de valoraciones que pueden ser provocadas por subastas ascendentes de precio de artículos, pero no por subastas de precio de artículo descendientes, y viceversa. Subastas ascendentes de precios de paquete: todas las subastas de precios ascendentes conocidas que pueden encontrar la asignación óptima entre las valoraciones generales (con eliminación gratuita) usan precios no anónimos. Las subastas anónimas de precio ascendente (por ejemplo, [42, 21, 37]) solo se sabe que pueden encontrar la asignación óptima entre valoraciones superaditivas u pocas otras clases simples ([36]). Mostramos que esto no es un error: Teorema: ninguna subasta ascendente con precios anónimos puede encontrar la asignación óptima entre las valoraciones generales.12 El cálculo no determinista se usa ampliamente en CS y también en economía (por ejemplo, un equilibrio de Walrasian o [38]). En algunos entornos, los modelos deterministas y no deterministas tienen la misma potencia (por ejemplo, cálculo con autómatas finitos). Este límite es independientemente del tiempo de ejecución, y también es válido para subastas descendentes y subastas no deterministas. Fortalecemos este resultado significativamente al demostrar que las subastas ascendentes anónimas no pueden producir una aproximación mejor que O (√ m): la relación de aproximación que se puede lograr con un número polinomial de consultas ([26, 32]) y, como se menciona, con unaNúmero polinómico de consultas de demanda de precio de artículo. El mismo límite inferior se mantiene claramente para subastas ascendentes anónimas de precio de artículos, ya que tales subastas pueden simularse mediante subastas ascendentes anónimas de precio de paquete. Actualmente no tenemos ningún límite inferior en la aproximación que se puede lograr con subastas ascendentes de precio no anónimo. Finalmente, estudiamos el rendimiento de las subastas ascendentes de eficiencia computacionales existentes. Estos protocolos ([37, 3]) requieren un tiempo exponencial en el peor de los casos, y esto es inevitable como se muestra por [32]. Sin embargo, también observamos que estas subastas, así como toda la clase de subastas de precio ascendentes similares, requieren un tiempo exponencial incluso para valoraciones aditivas simples. Esto es evitable y, de hecho, las subastas ascendentes de precios de elementos de [22] pueden encontrar la asignación óptima para estas valoraciones simples con la comunicación polinomial.3. El Modelo 3.1 Subastas discretas para valores continuos Nuestro modelo tiene como objetivo capturar subastas iterativas que operan en valoraciones de valor real. Aquí hay una ligera dificultad técnica al cerrar la brecha entre la naturaleza discreta de una subasta iterativa y la naturaleza continua de las valoraciones. Este es exactamente el mismo problema que en el modelado de una subasta simple en inglés. Hay tres formas formales estándar de modelarlo: 1. Modele la subasta como un proceso continuo y estudie su trayectoria en el tiempo. Por ejemplo, la llamada subasta japonesa es básicamente un modelo continuo de un modelo inglés. 13 2. Modele la subasta como discreta y las valoraciones como valoradas continuamente. En este caso, presentamos un parámetro y generalmente requerimos la subasta para producir resultados que sean óptimos.3. Modele las valoraciones como discretas. En este caso, asumiremos que todas las valoraciones son múltiplos enteros de una pequeña cantidad fija δ, por ejemplo, 1 centavo. Toda la comunicación en este caso es naturalmente finita. En este artículo usamos la última formulación y suponemos que todos los valores son múltiplos de algunos δ. Por lo tanto, en algunas partes del documento suponemos sin pérdida de generalidad que δ = 1, por lo tanto, todas las valoraciones son integrales. Casi todos (si no todos) de nuestros resultados se pueden traducir a los otros dos modelos con poco esfuerzo.3.2 valoraciones Un solo subastador está vendiendo m artículos no homogéneos indivisibles en una sola subasta, y sea el conjunto de estos 13 Otro modelo similar es el modelo de cuchillos en movimiento en la literatura de corte de pastel.34 ítems y n ser el conjunto de postores. Cada uno de los N postores en la subasta tiene una función de valoración VI: 2m → {0, Δ, 2Δ, ..., l}, donde para cada paquete de elementos s ⊆ m, vi (s) denota el valor del postorI para el paquete S y es un múltiplo de δ en el rango 0 ... l.A veces denotaremos el número de bits necesarios para representar dichos valores en el rango 0 ... l por t = log L. Asumimos la eliminación libre, es decir, S ⊆ t implica vi (s) ≤ vi (t) y que vi(∅) = 0 para todos los postores. Mencionaremos las siguientes clases de valoraciones: • Una valoración se llama submodular si para todos los conjuntos de elementos A y B tenemos que V (A ∪ B) + V (A ∩ B) ≤ V (A) + V (B).• Una valoración se llama súper aditiva si para todos los conjuntos de elementos disjuntos de los elementos A y B tenemos esa V (A∪B) ≥ V (A)+ V (B).• Una valoración se llama un Kor K-Bundle si se puede representar como una combinación XOR en la mayoría de las ofertas atómicas de K [30], es decir, si hay en la mayoría de K Bundles SI y Precios Pi tal que para todos S, V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V (V ((S) = maxi | s⊇si pi. Dichas valoraciones serán denotadas por V = (S1: P1) ⊕ (S2: P2) ⊕...⊕ (SK: PK) .14 3.3 Subastas iterativas El subastador establece un protocolo (de manera equivalente un algoritmo), donde en cada etapa del protocolo alguna información q - denominado consulta - se envía a algún postor i, y luego el postor i respondecon alguna respuesta que depende de la consulta, así como de su propia valoración. En este documento, suponemos que tenemos un control completo sobre el comportamiento de los licitadores y, por lo tanto, el protocolo también define una función de respuesta RI (Q, VI) que especifica que el oferente es respuesta a la consulta q. El protocolo puede ser adaptativo: el valor de la consulta y el postor consultado pueden depender de las respuestas recibidas para consultas anteriores. Al final del protocolo, se debe declarar una asignación S1 ... Sn, donde Si ∩ Sj = ∅ para i = j. Decimos que la subasta encuentra una asignación óptima si encuentra la asignación que maximiza el bienestar social I vi (Si). Decimos que encuentra una acercamiento C si P I VI (Si) ≥ P I VI (TI)/C donde T1 ... TN es una asignación óptima. El tiempo de ejecución de la subasta en una instancia determinada de las valoraciones de los licitantes es el número total de consultas realizadas en este caso. El tiempo de ejecución de un protocolo es el costo del peor de los casos en todas las instancias. Tenga en cuenta que no imponemos limitaciones computacionales en el protocolo o en los jugadores.15 Esto, por supuesto, solo fortalece nuestros resultados de dureza. Sin embargo, nuestros resultados positivos no utilizarán esta potencia y serán eficientes también en el sentido computacional habitual. Nuestro objetivo será diseñar protocolos computacionalmente eficientes. Consideraremos un protocolo computacionalmente eficiente si su costo es polinomial en los parámetros relevantes: el número de postores n, el número de elementos m y t = log l, donde l es el valor más grande posible de un paquete. Sin embargo, cuando discutimos las subastas de precio ascendente y sus variantes, se requerirá un protocolo computacionalmente eficiente para ser 14, por ejemplo, V = (ABCD: 5) ⊕ (AB: 3) ⊕ (C: 4) denota la valoración XORcon los términos ABCD, AB, C y precios 5, 3, 4 respectivamente. Para esta valoración, V (ABCD) = 5, V (ABD) = 3, V (ABC) = 4. 15 El tiempo de ejecución realmente mide los costos de comunicación y no el tiempo de ejecución computacional.Pseudo-polinomio, es decir, debe solicitar una serie de consultas que es polinomial en M, N y L δ. Esto se debe a que las subastas ascendentes generalmente no pueden alcanzar tales tiempos de ejecución (considere incluso la subasta en inglés en un solo elemento) .16 Tenga en cuenta que todos nuestros resultados dan límites concretos, donde la dependencia de los parámetros se da explícitamente;Utilizamos la notación estándar de Big-OH como una taquigrafía. Decimos que una subasta provoca una clase V de valoraciones, si determina la asignación óptima para cualquier perfil de valoraciones extraídas de V;Decimos que una subasta provoca completamente una clase de valoraciones V, si puede aprender completamente cualquier valoración v ∈ V (es decir, aprender V (s) para cada s).3.4 Consultas de demanda y subastas ascendentes La mayor parte del documento se preocupará por un caso especial de subastas iterativas comunes que calificamos las subastas de demanda. En tales subastas, las consultas que se envían a los licitadores son consultas de demanda: la consulta especifica un precio P (s) ∈ + para cada paquete S. La respuesta del postor I es simplemente el conjunto más deseado, exigido, bajo estos precios. Formalmente, un conjunto S que maximiza VI (S) - P (S). Puede suceder que más de un conjunto maximice este valor. En cuyo caso, los lazos se rompen de acuerdo con una regla fija de rato de vínculo, por ejemplo, se devuelve el primer conjunto lexicográfico. Todos nuestros resultados se mantienen para cualquier regla fija que rompa la corbata. Las subastas ascendentes son subastas iterativas con precios que no dan decreciente: Definición 1. En una subasta ascendente, los precios en las consultas para el mismo postor solo pueden aumentar en el tiempo. Formalmente, Sea P una consulta hecha para el postor i, y Q sea una consulta hecha para el postor i en una etapa posterior en el protocolo. Luego, para todos los conjuntos S, Q (s) ≥ P (s). Una variante similar, que también estudiamos y que también es común en la vida real, son las subastas descendentes, en las que los precios solo pueden disminuir en el tiempo. Tenga en cuenta que el término subasta ascendente se refiere a una subasta con una sola trayectoria ascendente de precios. Puede ser útil definir subastas ascendentes de múltiples trayectoria, en las que los precios pueden reiniciar a cero varias veces (ver, por ejemplo, [4]). Consideramos dos restricciones principales en los tipos de consultas de demanda permitidas: Definición 2. Precios del artículo: Los precios en cada consulta están dados por precios PJ para cada artículo j. El precio de un conjunto es aditivo: p (s) = p j∈S PJ. Precios anónimos: los precios vistos por los postores en cualquier etapa de la subasta son los mismos, es decir, cada vez que se realiza una consulta a algún postor, la misma consulta también se realiza a todos los demás postores (con los precios sin cambios). En subastas con precios no anónimos (discriminatorios), cada postor i ha personalizado los precios denotados por PI (S) .17 En este documento, todas las subastas son anónimas a menos que se especifique lo contrario. Tenga en cuenta que aunque en nuestro modelo las valoraciones son integrales (o múltiplos de algunos δ), permitimos la consulta de demanda a 16 La mayoría de las subastas que presentamos puede adaptarse para ejecutar en el tiempo polinomio en log L, utilizando una búsqueda binaria similar a una búsqueda binariaprocedimiento, perder su naturaleza ascendente.17 Tenga en cuenta que una subasta no anónima puede simularse claramente por n subastas anónimas paralelas.35 Use números reales arbitrarios en +. Es decir, suponemos que el incremento que usamos en las subastas ascendentes puede ser significativamente menor que δ. Todos nuestros resultados de dureza se mantienen para cualquiera, incluso para incrementos continuos de precios. Un problema práctico aquí es cómo se especificará la consulta: en el caso general, se debe enviar un número exponencial de precios en una sola consulta. Formalmente, este no es un problema ya que el modelo no limita la duración de las consultas de ninguna manera: el protocolo simplemente debe definir cuáles son los precios en términos de las respuestas recibidas para consultas anteriores. Analizamos este problema más en la Sección 4.3.4. El poder de las consultas de demanda En esta sección, estudiamos el poder de las subastas iterativas que utilizan consultas de demanda (no necesariamente ascendentes). Comenzamos comparando consultas de demanda con otros tipos de consultas. Luego, discutimos qué tan bien se puede aproximar el bienestar óptimo utilizando un número polinomial de consultas de demanda. También iniciamos el estudio de la representación de consultas de demanda de precios de paquete, y finalmente mostramos cómo las consultas de demanda ayudan a resolver la relajación de programación lineal de las subastas combinatorias en el tiempo polinomial.4.1 El poder de los diferentes tipos de consultas en esta sección comparamos el poder de los diversos tipos de consultas definidas en la Sección 2. Presentaremos simulaciones computacionalmente eficientes de estos tipos de consultas utilizando consultas de demanda de precio de elemento. En la Sección 5.1 mostramos que estas simulaciones también se pueden realizar utilizando subastas ascendentes de precio de elemento. Una consulta de valor puede ser simulada mediante consultas de valor marginal. Una consulta de valor marginal puede simularse mediante dos consultas de valor. Se puede simular una consulta de valor mediante consultas de demanda MT (donde t = log L es el número de bits necesarios para representar un solo valor de paquete) .18 Como corolario directo obtenemos que las subastas de demanda siempre pueden provocar completamente las valoraciones de los licitadores simulando a todosPosibles consultas 2m - 1 y, por lo tanto, provocar suficiente información para determinar la asignación óptima. Tenga en cuenta, sin embargo, que esta obtención puede ser computacionalmente ineficiente. El siguiente lema muestra que las consultas de demanda pueden ser exponencialmente más poderosas que las consultas de valor. Se puede requerir un número exponencial de consultas de valor para simular una sola consulta de demanda. Sin embargo, las consultas de utilidad indirecta son equivalentes en el poder de las consultas de demanda: Lemma 4.4. Una consulta de utilidad indirecta puede simularse mediante consultas de demanda MT + 1. Una consulta de demanda puede simularse mediante consultas de utilidad indirecta M + 1. Las consultas de demanda también pueden simular consultas de demanda parecida parecida: 19 18 Tenga en cuenta que las consultas de demanda de precio de T pueden simular fácilmente una consulta de valor estableciendo los precios de todos los paquetes, excepto S (el paquete con el valor desconocido) para ser L, y realizar lUna búsqueda binaria sobre el precio de S. 19 NOTA: Aunque en nuestro modelo los valores son integrales (nuestros múltiplos de δ), permitimos que los precios de la consulta sean arbitrarios reales mv d iu rd v 1 2 expp exp mv m 1 exp mv 1 exppExp exp d mt poly 1 mt+1 poly iu 1 2 m+1 1 poly rd - - - 1 Figura 4: Cada entrada en la tabla especifica cuántas consultas de esta fila se necesitan para simular una consulta de la columna relevante. Abreviaturas: V (consulta de valor), MV (consulta de valor marginal), D (consulta de demanda), IU (consulta de utilidad indirecta), RD (consulta de demanda relativa). Las consultas de demanda relativa se pueden simular mediante un número polinomial de consultas de demanda. De acuerdo con nuestra definición de consultas de demanda relativa, claramente no pueden simular consultas de valor uniformes. La Figura 4 resume las relaciones entre estos tipos de consultas.4.2 Aproximación del bienestar social con consultas de valor y demanda Sabemos de [32] que las subastas combinatorias iterativas que solo usan un número polinomial de consultas no pueden encontrar una asignación óptima entre las valoraciones generales y de hecho ni siquiera pueden aproximarlo dentro de un factor mejor.que min {n, m1/2−}. En esta sección, preguntamos qué tan bien se puede hacer esta aproximación utilizando consultas de demanda con los precios del artículo o utilizando las consultas de valor más débiles. Mostramos que, utilizando consultas de demanda, el límite inferior puede coincidir, mientras que las consultas de valor solo pueden funcionar mucho. La Figura 5 describe un algoritmo de tiempo polinomial que logra una relación de aproximación min (N, O (√ m)). Este algoritmo elige con avidez los paquetes que maximizan el valor de los licitadores por ítem (utilizando consultas de demanda relativa, consulte la Sección 4.1). Como paso final, asigna todos los elementos a un solo postor si mejora el bienestar social (esto se puede verificar utilizando consultas de valor). Dado que tanto las consultas de valor como las consultas de demanda relativa pueden simularse mediante un número polinómico de consultas de demanda con los precios de los artículos (Lemmas 4.2 y 4.5), este algoritmo puede implementarse mediante un número polinomial de consultas de demanda con precios de artículos.20 Teorema 4.6. La subasta descrita en la Figura 5 puede implementarse mediante un número polinomial de consultas de demanda y logra una matriz {N, 4 √ m} -Proximación para el bienestar social. Ahora preguntamos qué tan bien se puede aproximar el bienestar óptimo por un número polinomial de consultas de valor. Primero observamos que las consultas de valor no son completamente impotentes: en [19] se muestra que si los elementos m se dividen en k paquetes fijos de tamaño m/k cada uno, y estos paquetes fijos se subastan como si cada uno fuera indivisible, entonces elEl bienestar social bers, por lo tanto, podemos tener paquetes con demandas relativas arbitrariamente cercanas. En este sentido, la simulación anterior es solo hasta cualquier dada (y el número de consultas es O (log L+log 1)). Cuando los precios de consulta de demanda relativa se dan como números racionales, la simulación exacta se implica cuando el registro es lineal en la longitud de entrada.20 En el documento completo [8], observamos que este algoritmo puede ser implementado por dos subastas descendentes de precios de elementos (donde permitimos eliminar elementos a lo largo de la subasta).36 Generado por dicha subasta es al menos una oproximación de m√ k de la posible en la subasta original. Observe que dicha subasta puede implementarse mediante consultas de valor 2K - 1 a cada postor, consultando el valor de cada paquete de los paquetes fijos. Por lo tanto, si elegimos K = log M bundles obtenemos una matrícula M√ log m mientras todavía usamos un número polinómico de consultas. El siguiente lema muestra que no es mucho más posible utilizando consultas de valor: Lemma 4.7. Cualquier subasta iterativa que use solo consultas de valor y distinga entre k-tuplas de valoraciones 0/1 donde la asignación óptima tiene valor 1, y aquellos en los que la asignación óptima tiene valor k requiere al menos 2 m k consultas. Considere la siguiente familia de valoraciones: para cada S, de modo que | S |> M/2, V (S) = 1, y existe un solo conjunto T, de modo que para | S |≤ M/2, V (S) = 1 IFF T ⊆ S y V (S) = 0 de lo contrario. Ahora mire el comportamiento del protocolo cuando todas las valoraciones vi tienen t = {1 ... m}. Claramente, en este caso, el valor de la mejor asignación es 1 ya que ningún conjunto de tamaño M 2 o inferior tiene un valor distinto de cero para cualquier jugador. Arregle la secuencia de consultas y respuestas recibidas en esta K-Tuple de valoraciones. Ahora considere la K-Tuple de las valoraciones elegidas al azar de la siguiente manera: una partición de los elementos m en k conjuntos t1 ... tk cada uno de tamaño m k cada uno se elige uniformemente al azar entre todas estas particiones. Ahora considere la K -Tuple de las valoraciones de nuestra familia que corresponden a esta partición, claramente se puede asignar a I, para cada i, obteniendo un valor total de k.Ahora mire el protocolo cuando se ejecute en estas valoraciones y compare su comportamiento con el caso original. Tenga en cuenta que la respuesta a una consulta al jugador i difiere entre el caso de ti y el caso original de t = {1 ... m} solo si | s |≤ M 2 y Ti ⊆ S. Dado que Ti se distribuye uniformemente entre todos los conjuntos de tamaño exactamente M K, tenemos eso para cualquier consulta fija al Jugador I, donde | S |≤ M 2, PR [Ti ⊆ S] ≤ „| S |m «| ti |≤ 2-m k usando el unión a la unión, si la secuencia original de consultas era de una longitud inferior a 2 m k, entonces con una probabilidad positiva, ninguna de las consultas en la secuencia recibiría una respuesta diferente a la tupla de entrada original. Esto está prohibido ya que el protocolo debe distinguir entre este caso y el caso original, que no puede suceder si todas las consultas reciben la misma respuesta. Por lo tanto, debe haber habido al menos 2 m K consultas para la tupla original de valoraciones. Concluimos que un protocolo de tiempo polinomial que usa solo consultas de valor no puede obtener una aproximación mejor que o (M log m) del bienestar: Teorema 4.8. Una subasta iterativa que utiliza un número polinómico de consultas de valor no puede lograr mejor que la aproximación O (M log m) para el bienestar social. Inmediato de Lema 4.7: Lograr cualquier relación de aproximación k que sea asintóticamente mayor que M log M necesita un número exponencial de consultas de valor. Un algoritmo de aproximación: Inicialización: Sea t ← m los artículos actuales para la venta. Deje que K ← N sea los postores actualmente participantes. Sea s ∗ 1 ← ∅, ..., s ∗ n ← ∅ la asignación provisional. Repita hasta que t = ∅ o k = ∅: pídale a cada postor i en k para el paquete si que maximice su valor por ítem, es decir, si ∈ Argmaxs⊆t vi (s) | S |. Sea yo el postor con el valor máximo por ítem, es decir, i ∈ ArgMaxi∈K vi (Si) | Si |. Establecer: S ∗ I = Si, K = K \\ i, M = M \\ Si Finalmente: solicite a los postores sus valores VI (m) para el gran paquete. Si asigna todos los elementos a algún postor, mejora el bienestar social logrado hasta ahora (es decir, ∃i ∈ N tal que vi (m)> p i∈N vi (s ∗ i)), luego asigne todos los elementos a este postor i i. Figura 5: Este algoritmo logra una aproximación min {n, 4 √ m} para el bienestar social, que es asintóticamente la mejor aproximación de peor, posible con comunicación polinómica. Este algoritmo se puede implementar con un número polinomial de consultas de demanda.4.3 La representación de los precios del paquete En esta sección solucionamos explícitamente el idioma en el que los precios del paquete se presentan a los postores en subastas de precios de paquete. Este idioma requiere que el algoritmo enumere explícitamente el precio de cada paquete con un precio no trivial. Trivial en este contexto es un precio igual al de uno de sus subconjuntos adecuados (que se enumeró explícitamente). Esta representación es equivalente al lenguaje XOR para expresar valoraciones. Formalmente, cada consulta Q viene dada por una expresión: Q = (S1: P1) ⊕ (S2: P2) ⊕ ... ⊕ (SL: PL). En esta representación, el precio exigido para cada conjunto s es simplemente p (s) = max {k = 1 ... l | sk⊆s} pk. La longitud de la consulta q = (S1: P1) ⊕ (S2: P2) ⊕ ... ⊕ (SL: PL) es l.El costo de un algoritmo es la suma de las longitudes de las consultas solicitadas durante la operación del algoritmo en la entrada del peor de los casos. Tenga en cuenta que bajo esta definición, las subastas de precios de paquete no son necesariamente más fuertes que las subastas de precio de elementos. Una consulta de Price de items que precios de cada artículo para 1 se traduce a una consulta exponencialmente larga de precios que necesita especificar el precio | S |Para cada paquete S. Pero quizás las subastas de precios de paquete aún pueden encontrar asignaciones óptimas cada vez que la subasta de dispositivos de artículos puede, sin simular directamente tales consultas? Mostramos que este no es el caso: de hecho, cuando se tiene en cuenta la duración de la representación, las subastas de precios del paquete a veces son muy inferiores a las subastas de precios de los artículos. Considere la siguiente familia de valoraciones: cada elemento se valora en 3, excepto que para algún conjunto único, su valor es un poco más: 3 | S |+ b, donde b ∈ {0, 1, 2}. Tenga en cuenta que una subasta de precios del artículo puede encontrar fácilmente la asignación óptima entre dos de esas valoraciones: establezca los precios de cada artículo en 3+;Si los conjuntos de demanda de los dos jugadores están vacíos, entonces B = 0 para ambas valoraciones, y una asignación arbitraria está bien. Si uno de ellos está vacío y el otro no vacío, asigne la demanda no vacía establecida a su postor y el resto al otro. Si ambos conjuntos de demanda no son vacíos, a menos que formen una partición exacta, necesitamos ver qué B es más grande, lo que podemos hacer aumentando el precio de un solo artículo en cada conjunto de demanda.37 Mostraremos que cualquier subasta de precio de paquete que use solo el idioma XOR para describir los precios del paquete requiere un costo exponencial (que incluye la suma de todas las longitudes de descripción de los precios) para encontrar una asignación óptima entre dos de dichas valoraciones. Cada subasta de precio de paquete que utiliza Xorexpressions para denotar los precios del paquete requiere un costo de 2Ω (√ m) para encontrar la asignación óptima entre dos valoraciones de la familia anterior. La complicación en la prueba proviene del hecho de que el uso de XOR -Expresiones, la longitud de la descripción del precio depende de la cantidad de paquetes cuyo precio es estrictamente mayor que cada uno de sus subconjuntos; esto puede ser significativamente menor que el número de paquetes que tienenun precio distinto de cero.(La prueba se vuelve fácil si requerimos que el protocolo nombre explícitamente cada paquete con precio distinto de cero). No conocemos ninguna prueba elemental para este lema (aunque creemos que se puede encontrar). En su lugar, reducimos el problema a un límite inferior bien conocido en la complejidad del circuito booleano [18] que indica que los circuitos booleanos de profundidad 3 que calculan la función mayoritaria en las variables M requieren 2Ω (√ m) de tamaño.4.4 Consultas de demanda y programación lineal Considere la siguiente relajación de programación lineal para el problema generalizado de determinación del ganador en las subastas combinatorias (el programa primario): Maximice x i∈N, S⊆M Wi XI, S VI (S) S.T. X i∈N, s | j∈S xi, s ≤ qj ∀j ∈ M x s⊆m xi, s ≤ di ∀i ∈ N xi, s ≥ 0 ∀i ∈ N, s ⊆ m Tenga en cuenta que el programa primario tiene unNúmero exponencial de variables. Sin embargo, podremos resolverlo en el tiempo polinomial utilizando consultas de demanda para los postores. La solución tendrá un soporte de tamaño polinomial (valores distintos de cero para Xi, S), y por lo tanto podremos describirlo en tiempo polinomial. Aquí está su doble: minimizar x j∈M qjpj + x i∈N diui s.t.ui + x j∈S pj ≥ wivi (s) ∀i ∈ N, s ⊆ m pi ≥ 0, uJ ≥ 0 ∀i ∈ M, j ∈ N Observe que el problema dual tiene exactamente n + m variables pero un número exponencialde restricciones. Por lo tanto, el dual se puede resolver utilizando el método elipsoide en el tiempo polinomial: si se puede implementar un oráculo de separación en el tiempo polinomial. Recuerde que un oráculo de separación, cuando se le da una posible solución, confirma que es una solución factible o responde con una restricción que es violada por la posible solución. Construimos un oráculo de separación para resolver el programa dual, utilizando una consulta de demanda única para cada uno de los postores. Considere una posible solución (U, P) para el programa dual. Podemos reescribir las restricciones del programa dual como: UI/WI ≥ VI (S)-x j fueronde la desigualdad previa. Por lo tanto, para verificar si (u, p) es factible, es suficiente para (1) consulta a cada postor que por su demanda di bajo los precios PJ/WI;(2) Verifique solo las N restricciones ui + p j∈Di pj ≥ wivi (di) (donde vi (di) puede simularse utilizando una secuencia polinomial de consultas de demanda como se muestra en Lemma 4.2). Si no se viola nada de estos, entonces estamos seguros de que (u, p) es factible;De lo contrario, obtenemos una restricción violada. Lo que queda por mostrar es cómo se puede resolver el programa Primal.(Recuerde que el programa Primal tiene un número exponencial de variables). Dado que el algoritmo elipsoide se ejecuta en tiempo polinomial, solo encuentra un número polinomial de restricciones durante su operación. Claramente, si todas las demás restricciones se eliminaran del programa dual, aún tendría la misma solución (agregar restricciones solo puede disminuir el espacio de soluciones factibles). Ahora tome el doble reducido donde solo existen las limitaciones encontradas, y mire su doble. Tendrá la misma solución que la dual original y, por lo tanto, del Primal original. Sin embargo, mire la forma de este dual del doble reducido. Es solo una versión del programa Primal con un número polinomial de variables, aquellas que corresponden a restricciones que permanecieron en el Dual reducido. Por lo tanto, se puede resolver en el tiempo polinomial, y esta solución resuelve claramente el programa primario original, estableciendo todas las demás variables en cero.5. Subastas ascendentes de precio de ítem En esta sección Caracterizamos el poder de las subastas ascendentes de precio de artículo. Primero mostramos que este poder no es trivial: tales subastas pueden en general provocar una cantidad exponencial de información. Por otro lado, mostramos que la asignación óptima no siempre puede ser determinada por una sola subasta ascendente, y en algunos casos, ni por un número exponencial de trayectorias de precio ascendente. Finalmente, separamos el poder de diferentes modelos de subastas ascendentes.5.1 El poder de las subastas ascendentes de precio de elementos primero mostramos que si se permiten incrementos lo suficientemente pequeños, una sola trayectoria ascendente de los precios de los elementos puede provocar preferencias que no pueden provocarse con la comunicación polinomial. Como se mencionó, todos nuestros resultados de dureza se mantienen para cualquier incremento, incluso infinitesimal. Algunas clases de valoraciones pueden ser provocadas por subastas ascendentes de precio de artículos, pero no pueden ser provocadas por un número polinomial de consultas de ningún tipo. Prueba.(Sketch) Considere dos postores con V (S) = 1 si | S |> n 2, v (s) = 0 if | s |<n 2 y cada uno s tal que | s |= n 2 tiene un valor desconocido de {0, 1}. Debido a [32], determinar la asignación óptima aquí requiere una comunicación exponencial en el peor de los casos. Sin embargo, mostramos (ver [9]) que una subasta ascendente de precio de ítems puede hacerlo, siempre que pueda usar incrementos exponencialmente pequeños. Ahora describimos otro resultado positivo para el poder de las subastas ascendentes a precio de ítems. En la Sección 4.1, mostramos 38 V (AB) V (A) V (B) Licitante 1 2 α ∈ (0, 1) β ∈ (0, 1) Licitante 2 2 2 2 Figura 6: No hay subastas ascendentes de precio de elementospuede determinar la asignación óptima para esta clase de valoraciones.que una consulta de valor se puede simular con un número polinomial (verdaderamente) de consultas de demanda de precio de elemento. Aquí, mostramos que cada consulta de valor puede ser simulada por un número polinomial (pseudo) de consultas de demanda de precio ascendente.(En la siguiente subsección, mostramos que no siempre podemos simular ni un par de consultas de valor utilizando una sola subasta ascendente de precio de elemento). En el documento completo (Parte II, [9]), mostramos que podemos simular otros tipos de consultas utilizando subastas ascendentes de precio de elemento. Una consulta de valor puede ser simulada por una subasta ascendente de precio de artículo. Esta simulación requiere un número polinomial de consultas. En realidad, la prueba de la Proposición 5.2 demuestra un resultado útil más fuerte con respecto a la información provocada por las subastas iterativas. Dice que en cualquier subasta iterativa en la que los cambios de los precios son lo suficientemente pequeños en cada etapa (subastas pseudocontinuas), se puede calcular el valor de todos los paquetes exigidos durante la subasta. La idea básica es que cuando el postor pasa de exigir algún paquete TI a exigir otro paquete Ti+1, hay un punto en el que es indiferente entre estos dos paquetes. Por lo tanto, conocer el valor de algún paquete demandado (por ejemplo, el conjunto vacío) permite calcular los valores de todos los demás paquetes exigidos. Decimos que una subasta es pseudocontinua, si solo usa consultas de demanda, y en cada paso, el precio de la mayoría de un elemento cambia por (para algunos ∈ (0, δ]) con respecto a la consulta anterior. Considere cualquier subasta pseudocontinua (no necesariamente ascendente), en la que el postor exige el conjunto vacío al menos una vez a lo largo de la subasta. Luego, el valor de cada paquete exigido por el postor I durante toda la subasta se puede calcular al final de la subasta.5.2 Limitaciones de las subastas ascendentes de precio de ítem Aunque observamos que las consultas de demanda pueden resolver cualquier problema de subastas combinatorias, cuando las consultas están restringidas a ascender, algunas clases de valoraciones no pueden provocarse ni ser totalmente aceleradas. Un ejemplo para dicha clase de valoraciones se da en la Figura 6. Hay clases de valoraciones que no pueden ser provocadas ni completamente provocadas por ninguna subasta ascendente de precio de elementos. Deje que el postor 1 tenga la valoración descrita en la primera fila de la Figura 6, donde α y β son valores desconocidos en (0, 1). Primero, demostramos que esta clase no puede ser completamente provocada por una sola subasta ascendente. Específicamente, una subasta ascendente no puede revelar los valores de α y β. Mientras PA y PB estén por debajo de 1, el postor siempre exigirá todo el paquete AB: su utilidad de AB es estrictamente mayor que la utilidad de A o B por separado. Por ejemplo, mostramos que u1 (ab)> u1 (a): u1 (ab) = 2 - (pa + pb) = 1 - pa + 1 - pb> va (a) - pa + 1 - pb> u1 (a) Por lo tanto, para obtener información sobre α o β, el precio de uno de los artículos debe convertirse en al menos 1, w.l.o.g.PA ≥ 1. Pero entonces, el Bundle A no será exigido por el Licitante 1 a lo largo de la subasta, por lo que no se obtendrá información sobre α. Ahora, suponga que se sabe que Bidder 2 tiene la valoración descrita en la segunda fila de la Figura 6. La asignación óptima depende de si α es mayor que β (en la valoración de los postres 1), y demostramos que una subasta ascendente no puede determinar esto. La prueba del teorema anterior muestra que para que se revele un valor desconocido, el precio de un artículo debe ser mayor que 1, y el otro precio debe ser menor que 1. Por lo tanto, en una trayectoria de precios monotónicas de precios, solo se puede revelar uno de estos valores. Una conclusión inmediata es que este resultado de imposibilidad también es válido para las subastas descendentes de precio de ítems. Dado que no existe tal trayectoria, entonces la misma conclusión incluso se mantiene para las subastas no deterministas de los precios (en las que los datos exógenos nos dicen cómo aumentar los precios). También tenga en cuenta que, dado que la dureza proviene de la imposibilidad a la valoración de una valoración de un solo postor, este resultado también es válido para las subastas de precio de artículo ascendentes no anónimos.5.3 Limitaciones de las subastas ascendentes de múltiples trayectoria Según el Teorema 5.4, ninguna subasta ascendente de precios de artículos siempre puede provocar las preferencias (demostramos un resultado similar para los precios del paquete en la Sección 6). ¿Pero pueden dos trayectorias ascendentes hacer el trabajo? ¿O un número polinómico de trayectorias ascendentes? Damos respuestas negativas para tales sugerencias. Definimos una subasta ascendente de K-trayectoria como una subasta iterativa de demanda en la que las consultas de demanda pueden dividirse a k conjuntos de consultas, donde los precios publicados en cada conjunto solo aumentan en el tiempo. Tenga en cuenta que usamos una definición general;Permite que las trayectorias se ejecuten en paralelo o secuencialmente, y usen información provocada en algunas trayectorias para determinar las consultas futuras en otras trayectorias. El poder de las subastas de trayectoria múltiple se puede demostrar por el resultado negativo de Gul y Stacchetti [17] que demostró que incluso para una subasta entre las valoraciones de los sustitutos, una subasta anónima de precio ascendente no puede calcular los precios de VCG para todos los jugadores.21 Ausubel [[4] Superó este resultado de imposibilidad y las subastas diseñadas que calculan los precios de VCG organizando la subasta como una secuencia de subastas ascendentes n + 1. Aquí, demostramos que uno no puede provocar valoraciones con términos K por menos de K - 1 trayectorias ascendentes. Por otro lado, mostramos que una fórmula XOR puede ser completamente provocada por subastas ascendentes no deterministas K-1 (o subastas ascendentes deterministas K-1 si el subastador conoce los bundles atómicos) .22 21 Un artículo no publicado reciente de Mishray Parkes extiende este resultado, y muestra que los precios no anónimos con precios son necesarios para que una subasta ascendente termine con un equilibrio universal-competitivo (que conduce a pagos de VCG).22 Este resultado en realidad separa el poder de la proposición determinista 39 5.5. Las valoraciones de XOR con términos K no pueden ser provocados (o completamente provocados) por ninguna subasta de ascendente de comprice de artículos (k-2), incluso cuando los paquetes atómicos son conocidos por el impulsor. Sin embargo, estas valoraciones pueden ser provocadas (y completamente provocadas) por subastas ascendentes no anónimas no anónimas no anónimas de (K-1). Además, se requiere un número exponencial de trayectorias para provocar algunas clases de valoraciones: Proposición 5.6. La obtención y la anicización completa de algunas clases de valoraciones no pueden ser realizadas mediante ninguna subasta ascendente de comprice de artículos k-trayectoria, donde k = o (2m). Prueba.(Sketch) Considere la siguiente clase de valoraciones: para | S |<m 2, v (s) = 0 y para | s |> m 2, v (s) = 2;Cada paquete de tamaño M 2 tiene algún valor desconocido en (0, 1). Mostramos ([9]) que una subasta ascendente de precio único puede revelar el valor de como máximo un paquete de tamaño n 2 y, por lo tanto, se necesita un número exponencial de trayectorias ascendentes para obtener tales valoraciones. Observamos que el algoritmo que presentamos en la Sección 4.2 puede implementarse mediante un número polinomial de subastas ascendentes (cada consulta de demanda de precio de ítems puede considerarse como una subasta ascendente separada) y, por lo tanto, un min (n, 4 √ m) -alculaciónse puede lograr mediante un número polinomial de subastas ascendentes. Actualmente no tenemos un mejor límite superior o ningún límite inferior.5.4 Separar los diversos modelos de subastas ascendentes Se han sugerido varios modelos para subastas ascendentes en la literatura. En esta sección, comparamos el poder de los diferentes modelos. Como se mencionó, todas las subastas se consideran anónimas y deterministas, a menos que se especifique lo contrario. Subastas descendentes: comenzamos la discusión de la relación entre subastas ascendentes y subastas descendentes con un ejemplo. El algoritmo de Lehmann, Lehmann y Nisan [25] puede implementarse mediante una simple subasta descendente de precio de elemento (ver el documento completo para obtener detalles [9]). Este algoritmo garantiza al menos la mitad de la eficiencia óptima para las valoraciones submodulares. Sin embargo, no estamos familiarizados con ninguna subasta ascendente que garantice una fracción similar de la eficiencia. Esto plantea una pregunta más general: ¿pueden las subastas ascendentes resolver cualquier problema de evaluación combinatoria que se pueda solucionar usando una subasta descendente (y viceversa)? Damos respuestas negativas a estas preguntas. La idea detrás de las pruebas es que la información que el subastador puede obtener de forma gratuita al comienzo de cada tipo de subasta es diferente.23 y subastas iterativas no deterministas: nuestra prueba muestra que una subasta iterativa no determinista puede provocar el kterm xor xorLas valoraciones con un número polinomial de consultas de demanda, y [7] muestran que esta obtención debe tomar un número exponencial de consultas de demanda.23 En subastas ascendentes, el subastador puede revelar el paquete más valioso (además de M) antes de comenzar a aumentar los precios, por lo que puede usar esta información para elegir adaptativamente las consultas posteriores. En las subastas descendentes, uno puede encontrar fácilmente el paquete con el precio promedio más alto por ítem, manteniendo todos los demás paquetes con servicios públicos no positivos y usar esta información en el cambio de precio adaptativo. Hay clases que no se pueden provocar (totalmente provocadas) mediante subastas ascendentes de precios de elementos, pero se pueden obtener (resp. Totalmente provocados) con una subasta descendente de precios de elementos. Hay clases que no se pueden provocar (totalmente provocadas) por subastas descendentes de precio de artículos, pero que pueden ser provocados (resp. Totalmente provocados) por subastas ascendentes de precio de artículos. Subastas deterministas versus no deterministas: las subastas ascendentes no deterministas pueden verse como subastas donde algún maestro benevolente que tiene información completa guía al subastador de cómo debe aumentar los precios. Es decir, la obtención de preferencias se puede hacer mediante una subasta ascendente no determinista, si hay alguna trayectoria ascendente que provoca suficiente información para determinar la asignación óptima (y verificar que es realmente óptima). Mostramos que las subastas ascendentes no deterministas son más poderosas que las subastas ascendentes deterministas: Proposición 5.9. Algunas clases pueden ser provocadas (totalmente obtenidas) por una subasta ascendente no determinista de artículos de artículos, pero no se puede provocar (respectivamente, totalmente obtenida) por subastas ascendentes deterministas de precios de artículos de ítems. Subastas anónimas versus no anónimas: como se mostrará en la Sección 6, el poder de las subastas ascendentes anónimas y no anónimas de precios de paquete difiere significativamente. Aquí, mostramos que también existe una diferencia para las subastas ascendentes de artículos de artículos. Algunas clases no pueden ser provocadas por subastas ascendentes anónimas de precio de artículos, pero pueden ser provocadas por una subasta ascendente de precio de artículo no anónimo. Subastas simultáneas: una subasta no anónima se llama simultánea si en cada etapa, el precio de algún artículo es elevado por cada licitador. El subastador puede usar la información recopilada hasta que cada etapa, en todas las trayectorias personalizadas, para determinar las siguientes consultas. Una subasta no anónima se llama secuencial si el subastador realiza una subasta para cada postor por separado, en orden secuencial. El subastador puede determinar la siguiente consulta basada en la información recopilada en las trayectorias completadas hasta ahora y en la historia de la trayectoria actual. Hay clases que no pueden ser provocadas por subastas ascendentes simultáneas no anónimas de precios de artículos, pero pueden ser provocadas por una subasta ascendente de precio de elemento no anónimo secuencial. Subastas ajenas: si el subastador determina las consultas, independientemente de las respuestas de los licitantes (es decir, las consultas están predefinidas), decimos que la subasta es ajena. De lo contrario, la subasta es adaptativa. Probamos que un comportamiento adaptativo del subastador puede ser beneficioso. Hay clases que no se pueden provocar (totalmente provocadas) utilizando subastas de ascenso de precio de elemento ajeno, pero que pueden ser provocados (resp. Totalmente provocados) mediante una subasta ascendente adaptativa de precio de elemento.40 5.5 PREVISIÓN DE PREFERENCIA versus (obtención completa La obtención de preferencia y la obtención completa son problemas estrechamente relacionados. Si la obtención completa es fácil (por ejemplo, en el tiempo polinomial), entonces la obtención claramente también es fácil (por una subasta no anónima, simplemente aprendiendo todas las valoraciones por separado24). Por otro lado, hay ejemplos en los que la obtención de preferencias se considera fácil, pero el aprendizaje es difícil (por lo general, la obtención requiere una menor cantidad de información; algunos ejemplos se pueden encontrar en [7]). Los algoritmos de tatonnement por [22, 12, 16] terminan con la asignación óptima para las valoraciones de sustitutos.25 Probamos que no podemos provocar completamente las valoraciones de los sustitutos (o incluso sus valoraciones de subclase de bueyes definidas en [25]), incluso paraUn solo postor, por una subasta ascendente de precio de ítems (¡aunque la asignación óptima se puede encontrar mediante una subasta ascendente para cualquier número de licitadores!). Las valoraciones sustitutivas no pueden ser totalmente provocadas por subastas ascendentes de precios de elementos. Además, no pueden ser completamente provocados por ninguna trayectorias ascendentes M 2 (M> 3). Si las valoraciones de los sustitutos tienen una representación compacta (es decir, polinomio en el número de bienes) es una pregunta abierta importante. Como un paso en esta dirección, mostramos que su subclase de valoraciones de bueyes tiene una representación compacta: cada valoración de bueyes puede representarse en la mayoría de los valores M2.26 Lemma 5.14. Cualquier valoración de bueyes puede estar representada por no más de los valores de M2.6. Las subastas ascendentes de precio de paquete Todas las subastas ascendentes en la literatura que se demuestran que encuentran la asignación óptima para las valoraciones sin restricciones son subastas de precio no anónimo (Ibundle (3) por Parkes y Ungar [37] y la subasta proxy por ausúbala y ausúbala y ausúbala y ausúmasMilgrom [3]). Sin embargo, se han sugerido varias subastas ascendentes anónimas (por ejemplo, Akba [42], [21] e Ibundle (2) [37]). En esta sección, demostramos que las subastas ascendentes anónimas de precio de paquete logran malos resultados en el peor de los casos. También mostramos que la familia de subastas ascendentes no anónimas de bundleprice puede funcionar exponencialmente más lenta que las simples subastas ascendentes a precios de artículos.6.1 Limitaciones de subastas ascendentes anónimas de precio de paquete Presentamos una clase de valoraciones que no pueden ser provocadas por subastas ascendentes anónimas de precio de paquete. Estas valoraciones se describen en la Figura 7. La idea básica: para determinar algún valor desconocido de un postor, debemos recaudar 24, nota que una subasta ascendente anónima no necesariamente no puede provocar una clase que pueda ser completamente provocada por una subasta ascendente.25 Las valoraciones sustitutivas se definen, por ejemplo, en [16]. En términos generales, un postor con una valoración sustituta continuará exigiendo un cierto artículo después de que aumentara el precio de otros artículos. Para completar, presentamos en el documento completo [9] una prueba de la eficiencia de tales subastas para valoraciones de sustitutos.26 Una valoración de la unidad-demanda es una valoración XOR en la que todos los paquetes atómicos son singletons. Las valoraciones de OXS pueden interpretarse como una agregación (OR) de cualquier número de postores de demanda unitaria. Licitación.1 v1 (ac) = 2 v1 (bd) = 2 v1 (cd) = α ∈ (0, 1) oferta.2 V2 (AB) = 2 V2 (CD) = 2 V2 (BD) = β ∈ (0, 1) Figura 7: Las subastas anónimas de precio ascendente no pueden determinar la asignación óptima para esta clase de valoraciones.Un precio de un paquete que el otro postor debe exigir en el futuro. Algunas clases de valoraciones no pueden ser provocadas por subastas ascendentes anónimas de precio. Considere un par de valoraciones XOR como se describe en la Figura 7. Para encontrar la asignación óptima debemos saber qué valor es mayor entre α y β.27 Sin embargo, no podemos aprender el valor de α y β mediante una sola trayectoria ascendente: suponga W.L.O.G.Ese postor 1 exige CD antes de que el postor 2 demanda BD (no se obtendrá información si no sucede nada de esto). En este caso, el precio de BD debe ser mayor que 1 (de lo contrario, el postor 1 prefiere BD a CD). Por lo tanto, Bidder 2 nunca exigirá el paquete BD, y no se obtendrá ninguna información sobre β. Las valoraciones descritas en la prueba del teorema 6.1 pueden ser fácilmente provocadas por una subasta ascendente de precio no anónimo. Por otro lado, las valoraciones en la Figura 6 pueden ser fácilmente provocadas por una subasta ascendente anónima de precio. Concluimos que el poder de estas dos familias de subastas ascendentes es incomparable. Fortalecemos el resultado de imposibilidad anterior al mostrar que las subastas anónimas de precio de paquete ni siquiera pueden lograr algo mejor que un min {o (n), o (√ m)}-aproximación para el bienestar social. Esta relación de aproximación se puede lograr con comunicación polinomial, y específicamente con un número polinomial de consultas de demanda de precio de elemento.28 Teorema 6.2. Una subasta ascendente anónima de precio de paquete no puede garantizar mejor que una aproximación min {n 2, √ m 2} para el bienestar óptimo. Prueba.(Sketch) Suponga que tenemos n licitadores y artículos N2 a la venta, y que n es primo. Construimos paquetes n2 distintos con las siguientes propiedades: para cada postor, definimos una partición si = (si 1, ..., si n) de los elementos N2 a los paquetes de n, de modo que cualquier dos paquetes de diferentes particiones se cruzan. En el documento completo, la Parte II [9] mostramos una construcción explícita utilizando las propiedades de las funciones lineales sobre los campos finitos. El resto de la prueba es independiente de la construcción específica. Usando estos paquetes N2, construimos una clase difícil de obtener. Cada postor tiene una oferta atómica, en su valoración XOR, para cada uno de estos paquetes N2. Un postor tengo un valor de 2 para cualquier paquete si j en su partición. Para todos los paquetes en las otras particiones, tiene un valor de 0 o de 1 - δ, y estos valores son desconocidos para el subastador. Dado que cada par de paquetes de diferentes particiones se cruzan, solo un postor puede recibir un paquete con un valor de 2. 27 Si α> β, la asignación óptima asignará CD al postor 1 y AB a Bidder 2. De lo contrario, le damos BD al Bidder 2 y AC a Bidder 1. Tenga en cuenta que ambos postores no pueden obtener un valor de 2 en la misma asignación, debido a las intersecciones de los paquetes de alto valor.28 Tenga en cuenta que las consultas de precio de paquete pueden usar comunicación exponencial, por lo que el límite inferior de [32] no se mantiene.41 Subastas ascendentes económicamente eficientes no anónimos: Inicialización: todos los precios se inicializan a cero (precios no anónimos del paquete). Repita: - Cada postor presenta un paquete que maximiza su utilidad bajo sus precios personalizados actuales.- El subastador calcula una asignación provisional que maximiza sus ingresos bajo los precios actuales.- Los precios de los paquetes que fueron exigidos por los postores perdidos se incrementan. Finalmente: Terminar cuando la asignación provisional asigna a cada postor el paquete que exigió. Figura 8: Se sabe que las subastas de esta familia (denotadas por subastas NBEA) logran el bienestar óptimo. Ningún postor exigirá un paquete de bajo valor, siempre que el precio de uno de sus paquetes de alto valor sea inferior a 1 (y así le gane una utilidad mayor que 1). Por lo tanto, para obtener información sobre los paquetes de bajo valor, el subastador primero debe elegir arbitrariamente a un postor (W.L.O.G Licitante 1) y elevar los precios de todos los paquetes (S1 1, ..., S1 n) que sea mayor que 1. Dado que los precios no pueden disminuir, los otros postores claramente nunca exigirán estos paquetes en etapas futuras. Un adversario puede elegir los valores de tal manera que los valores bajos de todos los licitadores para los paquetes que no están en la partición de los postres 1s son cero (es decir, vi (S1 j) = 0 por cada i = 1 y cada j), sin embargo, asignando a cada licitadorUn paquete diferente de la partición de los postres 1 podría lograr un bienestar de n+1− (n - 1) δ (la valoración de los postor 1s es 2 y 1 - δ para todos los demás postores);Si estos paquetes se asignaron erróneamente, solo se podría lograr un bienestar de 2 (2 para el paquete de alto valor de los postres, 0 para todos los demás postores). En este punto, el subastador no puede tener ninguna información sobre la identidad de los paquetes con los valores distintos de cero. Por lo tanto, un adversario puede elegir los valores de los paquetes recibidos por los postores 2, ..., n en la asignación final para ser cero. Llegamos a la conclusión de que las subastas anónimas de bundleprice no pueden garantizar un bienestar superior a 2 para esta clase, donde el bienestar óptimo puede ser arbitrariamente cerca de N + 1. 6.2 Precios del paquete vs. Precios del artículo El núcleo de las subastas en [37, 3] es el esquema descrito en la Figura 8 (en el espíritu de [35]) para subastas con precios no anónimos. Las subastas de este esquema terminan con la asignación óptima para cualquier clase de valoraciones. Denotamos a esta familia de subastas ascendentes como subastas NBEA29. Las subastas de NBEA pueden provocar valoraciones XOR a término mediante un número polinomio (en k) de pasos, aunque la obtención de tales valoraciones puede requerir un número exponencial de consultas de precio de elemento ([7]), y las subastas ascendentes a precios de elementos no pueden haceres en absoluto (Teorema 5.4). Sin embargo, mostramos que las subastas NBEA (y en particular, Ibundle (3) y la subasta de poder) a veces son inferiores a las simples subastas de demanda de precios de artículos. Esto puede justificar el uso de subastas híbridas que usan precios lineales y no lineales (por ejemplo, la subasta de reloj de reloj [10]). Mostramos que las subastas de estas 29 subastas ascendentes económicamente eficientes económicamente eficientes. Para completar, damos en el documento completo [9] una prueba simple de la eficiencia (hasta una) de subastas de este esquema.La familia puede usar un número exponencial de consultas incluso para determinar la asignación óptima entre dos postores con valoraciones aditivas30, donde tales valoraciones pueden ser provocadas por una subasta ascendente simple de precio de artículos. De hecho, demostramos esta propiedad para una clase más amplia de subastas que llamamos subastas conservadoras. También observamos que en subastas conservadoras, permitir que los postores presenten todos los paquetes en sus conjuntos de demanda aseguran que la subasta ejecute un número polinómico de pasos, si L no es demasiado alto (pero con una comunicación exponencial, por supuesto). Una subasta ascendente se llama conservadora si no es anónimo, utiliza precios de paquete inicializados a cero y en cada etapa el subastador solo puede aumentar los precios de los paquetes exigidos por los postores hasta esta etapa. Además, cada postor solo puede recibir paquetes que exigió durante la subasta. Tenga en cuenta que las subastas NBEA son, por definición, conservadoras. Si cada postor exige un solo paquete en cada paso de la subasta, las subastas conservadoras pueden funcionar para un número exponencial de pasos incluso para valoraciones aditivas. Si los postores pueden enviar todos los paquetes en sus conjuntos de demanda en cada paso, entonces las subastas conservadoras pueden funcionar en un número polinómico de pasos para cualquier perfil de valoraciones, siempre que la valoración máxima l sea polinomial en M, N y 1δ.

        "Most existing iterative combinatorial auctions are based on repeatedly suggesting prices for bundles of items, and querying the bidders for their demand under these prices.",
        "We prove a large number of results showing the boundaries of what can be achieved by auctions of this kind.",
        "We first focus on auctions that use a polynomial number of demand queries, and then we analyze the power of different kinds of ascending-price auctions.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors F.2 [Theory of Computation]: Analysis of Algorithms and Problem Complexity; J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Economics, Theory 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Combinatorial auctions have recently received a lot of attention.",
        "In a combinatorial auction, a set M of m nonidentical items are sold in a single auction to n competing bidders.",
        "The bidders have preferences regarding the bundles of items that they may receive.",
        "The preferences of bidder i are specified by a valuation function vi : 2M → R+ , where vi(S) denotes the value that bidder i attaches to winning the bundle of items S. We assume free disposal, i.e., that the vis are monotone non-decreasing.",
        "The usual goal of the auctioneer is to optimize the social welfare P i vi(Si), where the allocation S1...Sn must be a partition of the items.",
        "Applications include many complex resource allocation problems and, in fact, combinatorial auctions may be viewed as the common abstraction of many complex resource allocation problems.",
        "Combinatorial auctions face both economic and computational difficulties and are a central problem in the recently active border of economic theory and computer science.",
        "A forthcoming book [11] addresses many of the issues involved in the design and implementation of combinatorial auctions.",
        "The design of a combinatorial auction involves many considerations.",
        "In this paper we focus on just one central issue: the communication between bidders and the allocation mechanism - preference elicitation.",
        "Transferring all information about bidders preferences requires an infeasible (exponential in m) amount of communication.",
        "Thus, direct revelation auctions in which bidders simply declare their preferences to the mechanism are only practical for very small auction sizes or for very limited families of bidder preferences.",
        "We have therefore seen a multitude of suggested iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly interacts with the different bidders, aiming to adaptively elicit enough information about the bidders preferences as to be able to find a good (optimal or close to optimal) allocation.",
        "Most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the bundles under the current set of prices, and then updating the set of bundle prices according to the replies received (e.g., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]).",
        "Effectively, such an iterative auction accesses the bidders preferences by repeatedly making the following type of demand query to bidders: Query to bidder i: a vector of bundle prices p = {p(S)}S⊆M ; Answer: a bundle of items S ⊆ M that maximizes vi(S) − p(S)..",
        "These types of queries are very natural in an economic setting as they capture the revealed preferences of the bidders.",
        "Some auctions, called item-price or linear-price auctions, specify a price pi for each item, and the price of any given bundle S is always linear, p(S) = P i∈S pi.",
        "Other auctions, called bundle-price auctions, allow specifying arbitrary (non-linear) prices p(S) for bundles.",
        "Another important differentiation between models of iterative auctions is 29 based on whether they use anonymous or non-anonymous prices: In some auctions the prices that are presented to the bidders are always the same (anonymous prices).",
        "In other auctions (non-anonymous), different bidders may face different (discriminatory) vectors of prices.",
        "In ascending-price auctions, forcing prices to be anonymous may be a significant restriction.",
        "In this paper, we embark on a systematic analysis of the computational power of iterative auctions that are based on demand queries.",
        "We do not aim to present auctions for practical use but rather to understand the limitations and possibilities of these kinds of auctions.",
        "In the first part of this paper, our main question is what can be done using a polynomial number of these types of queries?",
        "That is, polynomial in the main parameters of the problem: n, m and the number of bits t needed for representing a single value vi(S).",
        "Note that from an algorithmic point of view we are talking about sub-linear time algorithms: the input size here is really n(2m − 1) numbers - the descriptions of the valuation functions of all bidders.",
        "There are two aspects to computational efficiency in these settings: the first is the communication with the bidders, i.e., the number of queries made, and the second is the usual computational tractability.",
        "Our lower bounds will depend only on the number of queriesand hold independently of any computational assumptions like P = NP.",
        "Our upper bounds will always be computationally efficient both in terms of the number of queries and in terms of regular computation.",
        "As mentioned, this paper concentrates on the single aspect of preference elicitation and on its computational consequences and does not address issues of incentives.",
        "This strengthens our lower bounds, but means that the upper bounds require evaluation from this perspective also before being used in any real combinatorial auction.1 The second part of this paper studies the power of ascending -price auctions.",
        "Ascending auctions are iterative auctions where the published prices cannot decrease in time.",
        "In this work, we try to systematically analyze what do the differences between various models of ascending auctions mean.",
        "We try to answer the following questions: (i) Which models of ascending auctions can find the optimal allocation, and for which classes of valuations? (ii) In cases where the optimal allocation cannot be determined by ascending auctions, how well can such auctions approximate the social welfare? (iii) How do the different models for ascending auctions compare?",
        "Are some models computationally stronger than others?",
        "Ascending auctions have been extensively studied in the literature (see the recent survey by Parkes [35]).",
        "Most of this work presented upper bounds, i.e., proposed mechanisms with ascending prices and analyzed their properties.",
        "A result which is closer in spirit to ours, is by Gul and Stacchetti [17], who showed that no item-price ascending auction can always determine the VCG prices, even for substitutes valuations.2 Our framework is more general than the traditional line of research that concentrates on the final allocation and 1 We do observe however that some weak incentive property comes for free in demand-query auctions since myopic players will answer all demand queries truthfully.",
        "We also note that in some cases (but not always!) the incentives issues can be handled orthogonally to the preference elicitation issues, e.g., by using Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) prices (e.g., [4, 34]). 2 We further discuss this result in Section 5.3.",

        "A Walrasian equilibrium3 is known to exist in the case of Substitutes valuations, and is known to be impossible for any wider class of valuations [16].",
        "This does not rule out other allocations by ascending auctions: in this paper we view the auctions as a computational process where the outcome - both the allocation and the payments - can be determined according to all the data elicited throughout the auction; This general framework strengthens our negative results.4 We find the study of ascending auctions appealing for various reasons.",
        "First, ascending auctions are widely used in many real-life settings from the FCC spectrum auctions [15] to almost any e-commerce website (e.g., [2, 1]).",
        "Actually, this is maybe the most straightforward way to sell items: ask the bidders what would they like to buy under certain prices, and increase the prices of over-demanded goods.",
        "Ascending auctions are also considered more intuitive for many bidders, and are believed to increase the trust of the bidders in the auctioneer, as they see the result gradually emerging from the bidders responses.",
        "Ascending auctions also have other desired economic properties, e.g., they incur smaller information revelation (consider, for example, English auctions vs. second-price sealed bid auctions). 1.1 Extant Work Many iterative combinatorial auction mechanisms rely on demand queries (see the survey in [35]).",
        "Figure 1 summa3 A Walrasian equilibrium is vector of item prices for which all the items are sold when each bidder receives a bundle in his demand set. 4 In few recent auction designs (e.g., [4, 28]) the payments are not necessarily the final prices of the auctions. 30 Valuation family Upper bound Reference Lower bound Reference General min(n, O( √ m)) [26], Section 4.2 min(n, m1/2− ) [32] Substitutes 1 [32] Submodular 2 [25], 1+ 1 2m , 1-1 e (*) [32],[23] Subadditive O(logm) [13] 2 [13] k-duplicates O(m1/k+1 ) [14] O(m1/k+1 ) [14] Procurement ln m [32] (log m)/2 [29, 32] Figure 2: The best approximation factors currently achievable by computationally-efficient combinatorial auctions, for several classes of valuations.",

        "For our purposes, two families of these auctions serve as the main motivating starting points: the first is the ascending item-price auctions of [22, 17] that with computational efficiency find an optimal allocation among (gross) substitutes valuations, and the second is the ascending bundleprice auctions of [37, 3] that find an optimal allocation among general valuations - but not necessarily with computational efficiency.",
        "The main lower bound in this area, due to [32], states that indeed, due to inherent communication requirements, it is not possible for any iterative auction to find the optimal allocation among general valuations with sub-exponentially many queries.",
        "A similar exponential lower bound was shown in [32] also for even approximating the optimal allocation to within a factor of m1/2− .",
        "Several lower bounds and upper bounds for approximation are known for some natural classes of valuations - these are summarized in Figure 2.",
        "In [32], the universal generality of demand queries is also shown: any non-deterministic communication protocol for finding an allocation that optimizes the social welfare can be converted into one that only uses demand queries (with bundle prices).",
        "In [41] this was generalized also to nondeterministic protocols for finding allocations that satisfy other natural types of economic requirements (e.g., approximate social efficiency, envy-freeness).",
        "However, in [33] it was demonstrated that this completeness of demand queries holds only in the nondeterministic setting, while in the usual deterministic setting, demand queries (even with bundle prices) may be exponentially weaker than general communication.",
        "Bundle-price auctions are a generalization of (the more natural and intuitive) item-price auctions.",
        "It is known that indeed item-price auctions may be exponentially weaker: a nice example is the case of valuations that are a XOR of k bundles5 , where k is small (say, polynomial).",
        "Lahaie and Parkes [24] show an economically-efficient bundle-price auction that uses a polynomial number of queries whenever k is polynomial.",
        "In contrast, [7] show that there exist valuations that are XORs of k = √ m bundles such that any item-price auction that finds an optimal allocation between them requires exponentially many queries.",
        "These results are part of a recent line of research ([7, 43, 24, 40]) that study the preference elicitation problem in combinatorial auctions and its relation to the full elicitation problem (i.e., learn5 These are valuations where bidders have values for k specific packages, and the value of each bundle is the maximal value of one of these packages that it contains. ing the exact valuations of the bidders).",
        "These papers adapt methods from machine-learning theory to the combinatorialauction setting.",
        "The preference elicitation problem and the full elicitation problem relate to a well studied problem in microeconomics known as the integrability problem (see, e.g., [27]).",
        "This problem studies if and when one can derive the utility function of a consumer from her demand function.",
        "Paper organization: Due to the relatively large number of results we present, we start with a survey of our new results in Section 2.",
        "After describing our formal model in Section 3, we present our results concerning the power of demand queries in Section 4.",

        "In particular this shows that demand queries can elicit all information about a valuation by simulating all 2m −1 value queries.",

        "This algorithm can be implemented with a polynomial number of demand queries. 4.3 The Representation of Bundle Prices In this section we explicitly fix the language in which bundle prices are presented to the bidders in bundle-price auctions.",
        "This language requires the algorithm to explicitly list the price of every bundle with a non-trivial price.",
        "Trivial in this context is a price that is equal to that of one of its proper subsets (which was listed explicitly).",
        "This representation is equivalent to the XOR-language for expressing valuations.",
        "Formally, each query q is given by an expression: q = (S1 : p1) ⊕ (S2 : p2) ⊕ ... ⊕ (Sl : pl).",
        "In this representation, the price demanded for every set S is simply p(S) = max{k=1...l|Sk⊆S}pk.",
        "Definition 4.",
        "The length of the query q = (S1 : p1) ⊕ (S2 : p2) ⊕ ... ⊕ (Sl : pl) is l. The cost of an algorithm is the sum of the lengths of the queries asked during the operation of the algorithm on the worst case input.",
        "Note that under this definition, bundle-price auctions are not necessarily stronger than item-price auctions.",
        "An itemprice query that prices each item for 1, is translated to an exponentially long bundle-price query that needs to specify the price |S| for each bundle S. But perhaps bundle-price auctions can still find optimal allocations whenever itemprice auction can, without directly simulating such queries?",
        "We show that this is not the case: indeed, when the representation length is taken into account, bundle price auctions are sometimes seriously inferior to item price auctions.",
        "Consider the following family of valuations: Each item is valued at 3, except that for some single set S, its value is a bit more: 3|S| + b, where b ∈ {0, 1, 2}.",
        "Note that an item price auction can easily find the optimal allocation between any two such valuations: Set the prices of each item to 3+ ; if the demand sets of the two players are both empty, then b = 0 for both valuations, and an arbitrary allocation is fine.",
        "If one of them is empty and the other non-empty, allocate the non-empty demand set to its bidder, and the rest to the other.",
        "If both demand sets are non-empty then, unless they form an exact partition, we need to see which b is larger, which we can do by increasing the price of a single item in each demand set. 37 We will show that any bundle-price auction that uses only the XOR-language to describe bundle prices requires an exponential cost (which includes the sum of all description lengths of prices) to find an optimal allocation between any two such valuations.",
        "Lemma 4.9.",
        "Every bundle-price auction that uses XORexpressions to denote bundle prices requires 2Ω( √ m) cost in order to find the optimal allocation among two valuations from the above family.",
        "The complication in the proof stems from the fact that using XOR-expressions, the length of the price description depends on the number of bundles whose price is strictly larger than each of their subsets - this may be significantly smaller than the number of bundles that have a non-zero price. (The proof becomes easy if we require the protocol to explicitly name every bundle with non-zero price.)",
        "We do not know of any elementary proof for this lemma (although we believe that one can be found).",
        "Instead we reduce the problem to a well known lower bound in boolean circuit complexity [18] stating that boolean circuits of depth 3 that compute the majority function on m variables require 2Ω( √ m) size. 4.4 Demand Queries and Linear Programming Consider the following linear-programming relaxation for the generalized winner-determination problem in combinatorial auctions (the primal program): Maximize X i∈N,S⊆M wi xi,S vi(S) s.t.",

        "Thus, the dual can be solved using the Ellipsoid method in polynomial time - if a separation oracle can be implemented in polynomial time.",
        "Recall that a separation oracle, when given a possible solution, either confirms that it is a feasible solution, or responds with a constraint that is violated by the possible solution.",
        "We construct a separation oracle for solving the dual program, using a single demand query to each of the bidders.",
        "Consider a possible solution (u, p) for the dual program.",
        "We can re-write the constraints of the dual program as: ui/wi ≥ vi(S) − X j∈S pj/wi Now a demand query to bidder i with prices pj/wi reveals exactly the set S that maximizes the RHS of the previous inequality.",
        "Thus, in order to check whether (u, p) is feasible it suffices to (1) query each bidder i for his demand Di under the prices pj/wi; (2) check only the n constraints ui + P j∈Di pj ≥ wivi(Di) (where vi(Di) can be simulated using a polynomial sequence of demand queries as shown in Lemma 4.2).",
        "If none of these is violated then we are assured that (u, p) is feasible; otherwise we get a violated constraint.",
        "What is left to be shown is how the primal program can be solved. (Recall that the primal program has an exponential number of variables.)",
        "Since the Ellipsoid algorithm runs in polynomial time, it encounters only a polynomial number of constraints during its operation.",
        "Clearly, if all other constraints were removed from the dual program, it would still have the same solution (adding constraints can only decrease the space of feasible solutions).",
        "Now take the reduced dual where only the constraints encountered exist, and look at its dual.",
        "It will have the same solution as the original dual and hence of the original primal.",
        "However, look at the form of this dual of the reduced dual.",
        "It is just a version of the primal program with a polynomial number of variables - those corresponding to constraints that remained in the reduced dual.",
        "Thus, it can be solved in polynomial time, and this solution clearly solves the original primal program, setting all other variables to zero. 5.",

        "It says that in any iterative auction in which the changes of prices are small enough in each stage (pseudocontinuous auctions), the value of all bundles demanded during the auction can be computed.",
        "The basic idea is that when the bidder moves from demanding some bundle Ti to demanding another bundle Ti+1, there is a point in which she is indifferent between these two bundles.",
        "Thus, knowing the value of some demanded bundle (e.g., the empty set) enables computing the values of all other demanded bundles.",

        "Specifically, an ascending auction cannot reveal the values of both α and β.",
        "As long as pa and pb are both below 1, the bidder will always demand the whole bundle ab: her utility from ab is strictly greater than the utility from either a or b separately.",
        "For example, we show that u1(ab) > u1(a): u1(ab) = 2 − (pa + pb) = 1 − pa + 1 − pb > vA(a) − pa + 1 − pb > u1(a) Thus, in order to gain any information about α or β, the price of one of the items should become at least 1, w.l.o.g. pa ≥ 1.",
        "But then, the bundle a will not be demanded by bidder 1 throughout the auction, thus no information at all will be gained about α.",
        "Now, assume that bidder 2 is known to have the valuation described in the second row of Figure 6.",
        "The optimal allocation depends on whether α is greater than β (in bidder 1s valuation), and we proved that an ascending auction cannot determine this.",

        "Therefore, in a price-monotonic trajectory of prices, only one of these values can be revealed.",
        "An immediate conclusion is that this impossibility result also holds for item-price descending auctions.",
        "Since no such trajectory exists, then the same conclusion even holds for non-deterministic itemprice auctions (in which exogenous data tells us how to increase the prices).",
        "Also note that since the hardness stems from the impossibility to fully-elicit a valuation of a single bidder, this result also holds for non-anonymous ascending item-price auctions. 5.3 Limitations of Multi-Trajectory Ascending Auctions According to Theorem 5.4, no ascending item-price auction can always elicit the preferences (we prove a similar result for bundle prices in section 6).",

        "Therefore, for eliciting any information about the low-valued bundles, the auctioneer should first arbitrarily choose a bidder (w.l.o.g bidder 1) and raise the prices of all the bundles (S1 1 , ..., S1 n) to be greater than 1.",
        "Since the prices cannot decrease, the other bidders will clearly never demand these bundles in future stages.",
        "An adversary may choose the values such that the low values of all the bidders for the bundles not in bidder 1s partition are zero (i.e., vi(S1 j ) = 0 for every i = 1 and every j), however, allocating each bidder a different bundle from bidder 1s partition, might achieve a welfare of n+1−(n−1)δ (bidder 1s valuation is 2, and 1 − δ for all other bidders); If these bundles were wrongly allocated, only a welfare of 2 might be achieved (2 for bidder 1s high-valued bundle, 0 for all other bidders).",
        "At this point, the auctioneer cannot have any information about the identity of the bundles with the non-zero values.",

        "NBEA auctions can elicit k-term XOR valuations by a polynomial (in k) number of steps , although the elicitation of such valuations may require an exponential number of item-price queries ([7]), and item-price ascending auctions cannot do it at all (Theorem 5.4).",
        "Nevertheless, we show that NBEA auctions (and in particular, iBundle(3) and the proxy auction) are sometimes inferior to simple item-price demand auctions.",

                "Thus, direct revelation auctions in which bidders simply declare their preferences to the mechanism are only practical for very small auction sizes or for very limited families of bidder preferences.",
                "We have therefore seen a multitude of suggested iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly interacts with the different bidders, aiming to adaptively elicit enough information about the bidders preferences as to be able to find a good (optimal or close to optimal) allocation.",
                "Most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the bundles under the current set of prices, and then updating the set of bundle prices according to the replies received (e.g., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]).",
                "Effectively, such an iterative auction accesses the bidders preferences by repeatedly making the following type of demand query to bidders: Query to bidder i: a vector of bundle prices p = {p(S)}S⊆M ; Answer: a bundle of items S ⊆ M that maximizes vi(S) − p(S)..",

(ii) In cases where the optimal allocation cannot be determined by ascending auctions, how well can such auctions approximate the social welfare?

                "We also note that in some cases (but not always!) the incentives issues can be handled orthogonally to the preference elicitation issues, e.g., by using Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) prices (e.g., [4, 34]). 2 We further discuss this result in Section 5.3.",

                "Ascending auctions are also considered more intuitive for many bidders, and are believed to increase the trust of the bidders in the auctioneer, as they see the result gradually emerging from the bidders responses.",

                "The preferences of bidder i are specified by a valuation function vi : 2M → R+ , where vi(S) denotes the value that bidder i attaches to winning the bundle of items S. We assume free disposal, i.e., that the vis are monotone non-decreasing.",
                "The usual goal of the auctioneer is to optimize the social welfare P i vi(Si), where the allocation S1...Sn must be a partition of the items.",

                "The design of a combinatorial auction involves many considerations.",
                "In this paper we focus on just one central issue: the communication between bidders and the allocation mechanism - preference elicitation.",
                "Transferring all information about bidders preferences requires an infeasible (exponential in m) amount of communication.",
                "Thus, direct revelation auctions in which bidders simply declare their preferences to the mechanism are only practical for very small auction sizes or for very limited families of bidder preferences.",
                "We have therefore seen a multitude of suggested iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly interacts with the different bidders, aiming to adaptively elicit enough information about the bidders preferences as to be able to find a good (optimal or close to optimal) allocation.",
                "Most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the bundles under the current set of prices, and then updating the set of bundle prices according to the replies received (e.g., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]).",
                "Effectively, such an iterative auction accesses the bidders preferences by repeatedly making the following type of demand query to bidders: Query to bidder i: a vector of bundle prices p = {p(S)}S⊆M ; Answer: a bundle of items S ⊆ M that maximizes vi(S) − p(S)..",
                "These types of queries are very natural in an economic setting as they capture the revealed preferences of the bidders.",
                "Some auctions, called item-<br>price</br> or linear-<br>price</br> auctions, specify a price pi for each item, and the price of any given bundle S is always linear, p(S) = P i∈S pi.",
                "Other auctions, called bundle-<br>price</br> auctions, allow specifying arbitrary (non-linear) prices p(S) for bundles.",
                "Another important differentiation between models of iterative auctions is 29 based on whether they use anonymous or non-anonymous prices: In some auctions the prices that are presented to the bidders are always the same (anonymous prices).",
                "In other auctions (non-anonymous), different bidders may face different (discriminatory) vectors of prices.",
                "In ascending-<br>price</br> auctions, forcing prices to be anonymous may be a significant restriction.",
                "In this paper, we embark on a systematic analysis of the computational power of iterative auctions that are based on demand queries.",
                "We do not aim to present auctions for practical use but rather to understand the limitations and possibilities of these kinds of auctions.",
                "In the first part of this paper, our main question is what can be done using a polynomial number of these types of queries?",
                "That is, polynomial in the main parameters of the problem: n, m and the number of bits t needed for representing a single value vi(S).",
                "Note that from an algorithmic point of view we are talking about sub-linear time algorithms: the input size here is really n(2m − 1) numbers - the descriptions of the valuation functions of all bidders.",
                "There are two aspects to computational efficiency in these settings: the first is the communication with the bidders, i.e., the number of queries made, and the second is the usual computational tractability.",
                "Our lower bounds will depend only on the number of queriesand hold independently of any computational assumptions like P = NP.",
                "Our upper bounds will always be computationally efficient both in terms of the number of queries and in terms of regular computation.",
                "As mentioned, this paper concentrates on the single aspect of preference elicitation and on its computational consequences and does not address issues of incentives.",
                "This strengthens our lower bounds, but means that the upper bounds require evaluation from this perspective also before being used in any real combinatorial auction.1 The second part of this paper studies the power of ascending -<br>price</br> auctions.",
                "Ascending auctions are iterative auctions where the published prices cannot decrease in time.",
                "In this work, we try to systematically analyze what do the differences between various models of ascending auctions mean.",
                "We try to answer the following questions: (i) Which models of ascending auctions can find the optimal allocation, and for which classes of valuations? (ii) In cases where the optimal allocation cannot be determined by ascending auctions, how well can such auctions approximate the social welfare? (iii) How do the different models for ascending auctions compare?",
                "Are some models computationally stronger than others?",
                "Ascending auctions have been extensively studied in the literature (see the recent survey by Parkes [35]).",
                "Most of this work presented upper bounds, i.e., proposed mechanisms with ascending prices and analyzed their properties.",
                "A result which is closer in spirit to ours, is by Gul and Stacchetti [17], who showed that no item-<br>price</br> ascending auction can always determine the VCG prices, even for substitutes valuations.2 Our framework is more general than the traditional line of research that concentrates on the final allocation and 1 We do observe however that some weak incentive property comes for free in demand-query auctions since myopic players will answer all demand queries truthfully.",
                "We also note that in some cases (but not always!) the incentives issues can be handled orthogonally to the preference elicitation issues, e.g., by using Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) prices (e.g., [4, 34]). 2 We further discuss this result in Section 5.3.",

                "First, ascending auctions are widely used in many real-life settings from the FCC spectrum auctions [15] to almost any e-commerce website (e.g., [2, 1]).",
                "Actually, this is maybe the most straightforward way to sell items: ask the bidders what would they like to buy under certain prices, and increase the prices of over-demanded goods.",
                "Ascending auctions are also considered more intuitive for many bidders, and are believed to increase the trust of the bidders in the auctioneer, as they see the result gradually emerging from the bidders responses.",
                "Ascending auctions also have other desired economic properties, e.g., they incur smaller information revelation (consider, for example, English auctions vs. second-<br>price</br> sealed bid auctions). 1.1 Extant Work Many iterative combinatorial auction mechanisms rely on demand queries (see the survey in [35]).",

                "For our purposes, two families of these auctions serve as the main motivating starting points: the first is the ascending item-<br>price</br> auctions of [22, 17] that with computational efficiency find an optimal allocation among (gross) substitutes valuations, and the second is the ascending bundleprice auctions of [37, 3] that find an optimal allocation among general valuations - but not necessarily with computational efficiency.",
                "The main lower bound in this area, due to [32], states that indeed, due to inherent communication requirements, it is not possible for any iterative auction to find the optimal allocation among general valuations with sub-exponentially many queries.",

                "Several lower bounds and upper bounds for approximation are known for some natural classes of valuations - these are summarized in Figure 2.",
                "In [32], the universal generality of demand queries is also shown: any non-deterministic communication protocol for finding an allocation that optimizes the social welfare can be converted into one that only uses demand queries (with bundle prices).",
                "In [41] this was generalized also to nondeterministic protocols for finding allocations that satisfy other natural types of economic requirements (e.g., approximate social efficiency, envy-freeness).",
                "However, in [33] it was demonstrated that this completeness of demand queries holds only in the nondeterministic setting, while in the usual deterministic setting, demand queries (even with bundle prices) may be exponentially weaker than general communication.",

                "Transferring all information about bidders preferences requires an infeasible (exponential in m) amount of communication.",
                "Thus, direct revelation auctions in which bidders simply declare their preferences to the mechanism are only practical for very small auction sizes or for very limited families of bidder preferences.",
                "We have therefore seen a multitude of suggested iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly interacts with the different bidders, aiming to adaptively elicit enough information about the bidders preferences as to be able to find a good (optimal or close to optimal) allocation.",
                "Most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the bundles under the current set of prices, and then updating the set of bundle prices according to the replies received (e.g., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]).",
                "Effectively, such an iterative auction accesses the bidders preferences by repeatedly making the following type of demand query to bidders: Query to bidder i: a vector of bundle prices p = {p(S)}S⊆M ; Answer: a bundle of items S ⊆ M that maximizes vi(S) − p(S)..",

                "Note that from an algorithmic point of view we are talking about sub-linear time algorithms: the input size here is really n(2m − 1) numbers - the descriptions of the valuation functions of all bidders.",
                "There are two aspects to computational efficiency in these settings: the first is the communication with the bidders, i.e., the number of queries made, and the second is the usual computational tractability.",
                "Our lower bounds will depend only on the number of queriesand hold independently of any computational assumptions like P = NP.",
                "Our upper bounds will always be computationally efficient both in terms of the number of queries and in terms of regular computation.",
                "As mentioned, this paper concentrates on the single aspect of preference elicitation and on its computational consequences and does not address issues of incentives.",
                "This strengthens our lower bounds, but means that the upper bounds require evaluation from this perspective also before being used in any real combinatorial auction.1 The second part of this paper studies the power of ascending -price auctions.",

                "In this work, we try to systematically analyze what do the differences between various models of ascending auctions mean.",
                "We try to answer the following questions: (i) Which models of ascending auctions can find the optimal allocation, and for which classes of valuations? (ii) In cases where the optimal allocation cannot be determined by ascending auctions, how well can such auctions approximate the social welfare? (iii) How do the different models for ascending auctions compare?",
                "Are some models computationally stronger than others?",

                "A result which is closer in spirit to ours, is by Gul and Stacchetti [17], who showed that no item-price ascending auction can always determine the VCG prices, even for substitutes valuations.2 Our framework is more general than the traditional line of research that concentrates on the final allocation and 1 We do observe however that some weak incentive property comes for free in demand-query auctions since myopic players will answer all demand queries truthfully.",
                "We also note that in some cases (but not always!) the incentives issues can be handled orthogonally to the preference elicitation issues, e.g., by using Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) prices (e.g., [4, 34]). 2 We further discuss this result in Section 5.3.",

                "Ascending auctions are also considered more intuitive for many bidders, and are believed to increase the trust of the bidders in the auctioneer, as they see the result gradually emerging from the bidders responses.",

                "The main lower bound in this area, due to [32], states that indeed, due to inherent communication requirements, it is not possible for any iterative auction to find the optimal allocation among general valuations with sub-exponentially many queries.",

                "In [32], the universal generality of demand queries is also shown: any non-deterministic communication protocol for finding an allocation that optimizes the social welfare can be converted into one that only uses demand queries (with bundle prices).",
                "In [41] this was generalized also to nondeterministic protocols for finding allocations that satisfy other natural types of economic requirements (e.g., approximate social efficiency, envy-freeness).",
                "However, in [33] it was demonstrated that this completeness of demand queries holds only in the nondeterministic setting, while in the usual deterministic setting, demand queries (even with bundle prices) may be exponentially weaker than general communication.",

                "The design of a combinatorial auction involves many considerations.",
                "In this paper we focus on just one central issue: the communication between bidders and the allocation mechanism - preference elicitation.",
                "Transferring all information about bidders preferences requires an infeasible (exponential in m) amount of communication.",
                "Thus, direct revelation auctions in which bidders simply declare their preferences to the mechanism are only practical for very small auction sizes or for very limited families of bidder preferences.",
                "We have therefore seen a multitude of suggested iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly interacts with the different bidders, aiming to adaptively elicit enough information about the bidders preferences as to be able to find a good (optimal or close to optimal) allocation.",
                "Most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the bundles under the current set of prices, and then updating the set of bundle prices according to the replies received (e.g., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]).",
                "Effectively, such an iterative auction accesses the bidders preferences by repeatedly making the following type of demand query to bidders: Query to bidder i: a vector of bundle prices p = {p(S)}S⊆M ; Answer: a bundle of items S ⊆ M that maximizes vi(S) − p(S)..",
                "These types of queries are very natural in an economic setting as they capture the revealed preferences of the bidders.",
                "Some auctions, called item-price or linear-price auctions, specify a price pi for each item, and the price of any given bundle S is always linear, p(S) = P i∈S pi.",

                "Another important differentiation between models of iterative auctions is 29 based on whether they use anonymous or non-anonymous prices: In some auctions the prices that are presented to the bidders are always the same (anonymous prices).",
                "In other auctions (non-anonymous), different bidders may face different (discriminatory) vectors of prices.",
                "In <br>ascending-price auction</br>s, forcing prices to be anonymous may be a significant restriction.",
                "In this paper, we embark on a systematic analysis of the computational power of iterative auctions that are based on demand queries.",
                "We do not aim to present auctions for practical use but rather to understand the limitations and possibilities of these kinds of auctions.",
                "In the first part of this paper, our main question is what can be done using a polynomial number of these types of queries?",
                "That is, polynomial in the main parameters of the problem: n, m and the number of bits t needed for representing a single value vi(S).",
                "Note that from an algorithmic point of view we are talking about sub-linear time algorithms: the input size here is really n(2m − 1) numbers - the descriptions of the valuation functions of all bidders.",
                "There are two aspects to computational efficiency in these settings: the first is the communication with the bidders, i.e., the number of queries made, and the second is the usual computational tractability.",
                "Our lower bounds will depend only on the number of queriesand hold independently of any computational assumptions like P = NP.",
                "Our upper bounds will always be computationally efficient both in terms of the number of queries and in terms of regular computation.",
                "As mentioned, this paper concentrates on the single aspect of preference elicitation and on its computational consequences and does not address issues of incentives.",
                "This strengthens our lower bounds, but means that the upper bounds require evaluation from this perspective also before being used in any real combinatorial auction.1 The second part of this paper studies the power of ascending -price auctions.",
                "Ascending auctions are iterative auctions where the published prices cannot decrease in time.",
                "In this work, we try to systematically analyze what do the differences between various models of ascending auctions mean.",
                "We try to answer the following questions: (i) Which models of ascending auctions can find the optimal allocation, and for which classes of valuations? (ii) In cases where the optimal allocation cannot be determined by ascending auctions, how well can such auctions approximate the social welfare? (iii) How do the different models for ascending auctions compare?",
                "Are some models computationally stronger than others?",
                "Ascending auctions have been extensively studied in the literature (see the recent survey by Parkes [35]).",

                "A result which is closer in spirit to ours, is by Gul and Stacchetti [17], who showed that no item-price ascending auction can always determine the VCG prices, even for substitutes valuations.2 Our framework is more general than the traditional line of research that concentrates on the final allocation and 1 We do observe however that some weak incentive property comes for free in demand-query auctions since myopic players will answer all demand queries truthfully.",
                "We also note that in some cases (but not always!) the incentives issues can be handled orthogonally to the preference elicitation issues, e.g., by using Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) prices (e.g., [4, 34]). 2 We further discuss this result in Section 5.3.",

                "In [32], the universal generality of demand queries is also shown: any non-deterministic communication protocol for finding an allocation that optimizes the social welfare can be converted into one that only uses demand queries (with bundle prices).",

                "In a combinatorial auction, a set M of m nonidentical items are sold in a single auction to n competing bidders.",
                "The bidders have preferences regarding the bundles of items that they may receive.",
                "The preferences of <br>bidder</br> i are specified by a valuation function vi : 2M → R+ , where vi(S) denotes the value that <br>bidder</br> i attaches to winning the bundle of items S. We assume free disposal, i.e., that the vis are monotone non-decreasing.",
                "The usual goal of the auctioneer is to optimize the social welfare P i vi(Si), where the allocation S1...Sn must be a partition of the items.",
                "Applications include many complex resource allocation problems and, in fact, combinatorial auctions may be viewed as the common abstraction of many complex resource allocation problems.",
                "Combinatorial auctions face both economic and computational difficulties and are a central problem in the recently active border of economic theory and computer science.",
                "A forthcoming book [11] addresses many of the issues involved in the design and implementation of combinatorial auctions.",
                "The design of a combinatorial auction involves many considerations.",
                "In this paper we focus on just one central issue: the communication between bidders and the allocation mechanism - preference elicitation.",
                "Transferring all information about bidders preferences requires an infeasible (exponential in m) amount of communication.",
                "Thus, direct revelation auctions in which bidders simply declare their preferences to the mechanism are only practical for very small auction sizes or for very limited families of <br>bidder</br> preferences.",
                "We have therefore seen a multitude of suggested iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly interacts with the different bidders, aiming to adaptively elicit enough information about the bidders preferences as to be able to find a good (optimal or close to optimal) allocation.",
                "Most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the bundles under the current set of prices, and then updating the set of bundle prices according to the replies received (e.g., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]).",
                "Effectively, such an iterative auction accesses the bidders preferences by repeatedly making the following type of demand query to bidders: Query to <br>bidder</br> i: a vector of bundle prices p = {p(S)}S⊆M ; Answer: a bundle of items S ⊆ M that maximizes vi(S) − p(S)..",
                "These types of queries are very natural in an economic setting as they capture the revealed preferences of the bidders.",
                "Some auctions, called item-price or linear-price auctions, specify a price pi for each item, and the price of any given bundle S is always linear, p(S) = P i∈S pi.",
                "Other auctions, called bundle-price auctions, allow specifying arbitrary (non-linear) prices p(S) for bundles.",
                "Another important differentiation between models of iterative auctions is 29 based on whether they use anonymous or non-anonymous prices: In some auctions the prices that are presented to the bidders are always the same (anonymous prices).",
                "In other auctions (non-anonymous), different bidders may face different (discriminatory) vectors of prices.",
                "In ascending-price auctions, forcing prices to be anonymous may be a significant restriction.",
                "In this paper, we embark on a systematic analysis of the computational power of iterative auctions that are based on demand queries.",
                "We do not aim to present auctions for practical use but rather to understand the limitations and possibilities of these kinds of auctions.",
                "In the first part of this paper, our main question is what can be done using a polynomial number of these types of queries?",
                "That is, polynomial in the main parameters of the problem: n, m and the number of bits t needed for representing a single value vi(S).",
                "Note that from an algorithmic point of view we are talking about sub-linear time algorithms: the input size here is really n(2m − 1) numbers - the descriptions of the valuation functions of all bidders.",
                "There are two aspects to computational efficiency in these settings: the first is the communication with the bidders, i.e., the number of queries made, and the second is the usual computational tractability.",
                "Our lower bounds will depend only on the number of queriesand hold independently of any computational assumptions like P = NP.",
                "Our upper bounds will always be computationally efficient both in terms of the number of queries and in terms of regular computation.",
                "As mentioned, this paper concentrates on the single aspect of preference elicitation and on its computational consequences and does not address issues of incentives.",
                "This strengthens our lower bounds, but means that the upper bounds require evaluation from this perspective also before being used in any real combinatorial auction.1 The second part of this paper studies the power of ascending -price auctions.",
                "Ascending auctions are iterative auctions where the published prices cannot decrease in time.",
                "In this work, we try to systematically analyze what do the differences between various models of ascending auctions mean.",
                "We try to answer the following questions: (i) Which models of ascending auctions can find the optimal allocation, and for which classes of valuations? (ii) In cases where the optimal allocation cannot be determined by ascending auctions, how well can such auctions approximate the social welfare? (iii) How do the different models for ascending auctions compare?",
                "Are some models computationally stronger than others?",
                "Ascending auctions have been extensively studied in the literature (see the recent survey by Parkes [35]).",
                "Most of this work presented upper bounds, i.e., proposed mechanisms with ascending prices and analyzed their properties.",
                "A result which is closer in spirit to ours, is by Gul and Stacchetti [17], who showed that no item-price ascending auction can always determine the VCG prices, even for substitutes valuations.2 Our framework is more general than the traditional line of research that concentrates on the final allocation and 1 We do observe however that some weak incentive property comes for free in demand-query auctions since myopic players will answer all demand queries truthfully.",
                "We also note that in some cases (but not always!) the incentives issues can be handled orthogonally to the preference elicitation issues, e.g., by using Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) prices (e.g., [4, 34]). 2 We further discuss this result in Section 5.3.",

                "First, ascending auctions are widely used in many real-life settings from the FCC spectrum auctions [15] to almost any e-commerce website (e.g., [2, 1]).",
                "Actually, this is maybe the most straightforward way to sell items: ask the bidders what would they like to buy under certain prices, and increase the prices of over-demanded goods.",
                "Ascending auctions are also considered more intuitive for many bidders, and are believed to increase the trust of the bidders in the auctioneer, as they see the result gradually emerging from the bidders responses.",
                "Ascending auctions also have other desired economic properties, e.g., they incur smaller information revelation (consider, for example, English auctions vs. second-price sealed bid auctions). 1.1 Extant Work Many iterative combinatorial auction mechanisms rely on demand queries (see the survey in [35]).",

                "For our purposes, two families of these auctions serve as the main motivating starting points: the first is the ascending item-price auctions of [22, 17] that with computational efficiency find an optimal allocation among (gross) substitutes valuations, and the second is the ascending bundleprice auctions of [37, 3] that find an optimal allocation among general valuations - but not necessarily with computational efficiency.",
                "The main lower bound in this area, due to [32], states that indeed, due to inherent communication requirements, it is not possible for any iterative auction to find the optimal allocation among general valuations with sub-exponentially many queries.",

                "In [32], the universal generality of demand queries is also shown: any non-deterministic communication protocol for finding an allocation that optimizes the social welfare can be converted into one that only uses demand queries (with bundle prices).",
                "In [41] this was generalized also to nondeterministic protocols for finding allocations that satisfy other natural types of economic requirements (e.g., approximate social efficiency, envy-freeness).",
                "However, in [33] it was demonstrated that this completeness of demand queries holds only in the nondeterministic setting, while in the usual deterministic setting, demand queries (even with bundle prices) may be exponentially weaker than general communication.",

                "The preferences of bidder i are specified by a valuation function vi : 2M → R+ , where vi(S) denotes the value that bidder i attaches to winning the bundle of items S. We assume free disposal, i.e., that the vis are monotone non-decreasing.",
                "The usual goal of the auctioneer is to optimize the social welfare P i vi(Si), where the allocation S1...Sn must be a partition of the items.",

                "The design of a combinatorial auction involves many considerations.",
                "In this paper we focus on just one central issue: the communication between bidders and the allocation mechanism - preference elicitation.",
                "Transferring all information about bidders preferences requires an infeasible (exponential in m) amount of communication.",
                "Thus, direct revelation auctions in which bidders simply declare their preferences to the mechanism are only practical for very small auction sizes or for very limited families of bidder preferences.",
                "We have therefore seen a multitude of suggested iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly interacts with the different bidders, aiming to adaptively elicit enough information about the bidders preferences as to be able to find a good (optimal or close to optimal) allocation.",
                "Most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the bundles under the current set of prices, and then updating the set of bundle prices according to the replies received (e.g., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]).",
                "Effectively, such an iterative auction accesses the bidders preferences by repeatedly making the following type of <br>demand query</br> to bidders: Query to bidder i: a vector of bundle prices p = {p(S)}S⊆M ; Answer: a bundle of items S ⊆ M that maximizes vi(S) − p(S)..",
                "These types of queries are very natural in an economic setting as they capture the revealed preferences of the bidders.",
                "Some auctions, called item-price or linear-price auctions, specify a price pi for each item, and the price of any given bundle S is always linear, p(S) = P i∈S pi.",

                "Another important differentiation between models of iterative auctions is 29 based on whether they use anonymous or non-anonymous prices: In some auctions the prices that are presented to the bidders are always the same (anonymous prices).",
                "In other auctions (non-anonymous), different bidders may face different (discriminatory) vectors of prices.",
                "In ascending-price auctions, forcing prices to be anonymous may be a significant restriction.",

                "In the first part of this paper, our main question is what can be done using a polynomial number of these types of queries?",

                "There are two aspects to computational efficiency in these settings: the first is the communication with the bidders, i.e., the number of queries made, and the second is the usual computational tractability.",
                "Our lower bounds will depend only on the number of queriesand hold independently of any computational assumptions like P = NP.",

                "We also note that in some cases (but not always!) the incentives issues can be handled orthogonally to the preference elicitation issues, e.g., by using Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) prices (e.g., [4, 34]). 2 We further discuss this result in Section 5.3.",

                "We have therefore seen a multitude of suggested iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly interacts with the different bidders, aiming to adaptively elicit enough information about the bidders preferences as to be able to find a good (optimal or close to optimal) allocation.",
                "Most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the bundles under the current set of prices, and then updating the set of bundle prices according to the replies received (e.g., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]).",
                "Effectively, such an iterative auction accesses the bidders preferences by repeatedly making the following type of demand query to bidders: Query to bidder i: a vector of bundle prices p = {p(S)}S⊆M ; Answer: a bundle of items S ⊆ M that maximizes vi(S) − p(S)..",

                "The preferences of bidder i are specified by a valuation function vi : 2M → R+ , where vi(S) denotes the value that bidder i attaches to winning the bundle of items S. We assume free disposal, i.e., that the vis are monotone non-decreasing.",
                "The usual goal of the auctioneer is to optimize the social welfare P i vi(Si), where the allocation S1...Sn must be a partition of the items.",

                "A forthcoming book [11] addresses many of the issues involved in the design and implementation of combinatorial auctions.",
                "The design of a combinatorial auction involves many considerations.",
                "In this paper we focus on just one central issue: the communication between bidders and the allocation mechanism - preference elicitation.",
                "Transferring all information about bidders preferences requires an infeasible (exponential in m) amount of communication.",
                "Thus, direct revelation auctions in which bidders simply declare their preferences to the mechanism are only practical for very small auction sizes or for very limited families of bidder preferences.",
                "We have therefore seen a multitude of suggested iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly interacts with the different bidders, aiming to adaptively elicit enough information about the bidders preferences as to be able to find a good (optimal or close to optimal) allocation.",
                "Most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the bundles under the current set of prices, and then updating the set of bundle prices according to the replies received (e.g., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]).",
                "Effectively, such an iterative auction accesses the bidders preferences by repeatedly making the following type of demand query to bidders: Query to bidder i: a vector of bundle prices p = {p(S)}S⊆M ; Answer: a bundle of items S ⊆ M that maximizes vi(S) − p(S)..",
                "These types of queries are very natural in an economic setting as they capture the revealed preferences of the bidders.",
                "Some auctions, called item-price or linear-price auctions, specify a price pi for each item, and the price of any given bundle S is always linear, p(S) = P i∈S pi.",
                "Other auctions, called bundle-price auctions, allow specifying arbitrary (non-linear) prices p(S) for bundles.",
                "Another important differentiation between models of iterative auctions is 29 based on whether they use anonymous or non-anonymous prices: In some auctions the prices that are presented to the bidders are always the same (anonymous prices).",
                "In other auctions (non-anonymous), different bidders may face different (discriminatory) vectors of prices.",
                "In ascending-price auctions, forcing prices to be anonymous may be a significant restriction.",
                "In this paper, we embark on a systematic analysis of the computational power of iterative auctions that are based on demand queries.",
                "We do not aim to present auctions for practical use but rather to understand the limitations and possibilities of these kinds of auctions.",
                "In the first part of this paper, our main question is what can be done using a polynomial number of these types of queries?",
                "That is, polynomial in the main parameters of the problem: n, m and the number of bits t needed for representing a single value vi(S).",
                "Note that from an algorithmic point of view we are talking about sub-linear time algorithms: the input size here is really n(2m − 1) numbers - the descriptions of the valuation functions of all bidders.",
                "There are two aspects to computational efficiency in these settings: the first is the communication with the bidders, i.e., the number of queries made, and the second is the usual computational tractability.",
                "Our lower bounds will depend only on the number of queriesand hold independently of any computational assumptions like P = NP.",
                "Our upper bounds will always be computationally efficient both in terms of the number of queries and in terms of regular computation.",
                "As mentioned, this paper concentrates on the single aspect of preference elicitation and on its computational consequences and does not address issues of incentives.",
                "This strengthens our lower bounds, but means that the upper bounds require evaluation from this perspective also before being used in any real combinatorial auction.1 The second part of this paper studies the power of ascending -price auctions.",
                "Ascending auctions are iterative auctions where the published prices cannot decrease in time.",
                "In this work, we try to systematically analyze what do the differences between various models of ascending auctions mean.",
                "We try to answer the following questions: (i) Which models of ascending auctions can find the optimal allocation, and for which classes of valuations? (ii) In cases where the optimal allocation cannot be determined by ascending auctions, how well can such auctions approximate the social welfare? (iii) How do the different models for ascending auctions compare?",
                "Are some models computationally stronger than others?",
                "Ascending auctions have been extensively studied in the literature (see the recent survey by Parkes [35]).",
                "Most of this work presented upper bounds, i.e., proposed mechanisms with ascending prices and analyzed their properties.",
                "A result which is closer in spirit to ours, is by Gul and Stacchetti [17], who showed that no item-price ascending auction can always determine the VCG prices, even for substitutes valuations.2 Our framework is more general than the traditional line of research that concentrates on the final allocation and 1 We do observe however that some weak incentive property comes for free in demand-query auctions since myopic players will answer all demand queries truthfully.",

                "The design of a combinatorial auction involves many considerations.",
                "In this paper we focus on just one central issue: the communication between bidders and the allocation mechanism - preference elicitation.",
                "Transferring all information about bidders preferences requires an infeasible (exponential in m) amount of communication.",
                "Thus, direct revelation auctions in which bidders simply declare their preferences to the mechanism are only practical for very small auction sizes or for very limited families of bidder preferences.",
                "We have therefore seen a multitude of suggested iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly interacts with the different bidders, aiming to adaptively elicit enough information about the bidders preferences as to be able to find a good (optimal or close to optimal) allocation.",
                "Most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the bundles under the current set of prices, and then updating the set of bundle prices according to the replies received (e.g., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]).",
                "Effectively, such an iterative auction accesses the bidders preferences by repeatedly making the following type of demand query to bidders: Query to bidder i: a vector of bundle prices p = {p(S)}S⊆M ; Answer: a bundle of items S ⊆ M that maximizes vi(S) − p(S)..",
                "These types of queries are very natural in an economic setting as they capture the revealed preferences of the bidders.",
                "Some auctions, called item-price or linear-price auctions, specify a price pi for each item, and the price of any given bundle S is always linear, p(S) = P i∈S pi.",
                "Other auctions, called bundle-price auctions, allow specifying arbitrary (non-linear) prices p(S) for bundles.",
                "Another important differentiation between models of iterative auctions is 29 based on whether they use anonymous or non-anonymous prices: In some auctions the prices that are presented to the bidders are always the same (anonymous prices).",
                "In other auctions (non-anonymous), different bidders may face different (discriminatory) vectors of prices.",
                "In ascending-price auctions, forcing prices to be anonymous may be a significant restriction.",
                "In this paper, we embark on a systematic analysis of the computational power of iterative auctions that are based on demand queries.",
                "We do not aim to present auctions for practical use but rather to understand the limitations and possibilities of these kinds of auctions.",
                "In the first part of this paper, our main question is what can be done using a polynomial number of these types of queries?",
                "That is, polynomial in the main parameters of the problem: n, m and the number of bits t needed for representing a single value vi(S).",
                "Note that from an algorithmic point of view we are talking about sub-linear time algorithms: the input size here is really n(2m − 1) numbers - the descriptions of the valuation functions of all bidders.",
                "There are two aspects to computational efficiency in these settings: the first is the communication with the bidders, i.e., the number of queries made, and the second is the usual computational tractability.",
                "Our lower bounds will depend only on the number of queriesand hold independently of any computational assumptions like P = NP.",
                "Our upper bounds will always be computationally efficient both in terms of the number of queries and in terms of regular computation.",
                "As mentioned, this paper concentrates on the single aspect of preference elicitation and on its computational consequences and does not address issues of incentives.",
                "This strengthens our lower bounds, but means that the upper bounds require evaluation from this perspective also before being used in any real combinatorial auction.1 The second part of this paper studies the power of ascending -price auctions.",
                "Ascending auctions are iterative auctions where the published prices cannot decrease in time.",
                "In this work, we try to systematically analyze what do the differences between various models of ascending auctions mean.",
                "We try to answer the following questions: (i) Which models of ascending auctions can find the <br>optimal allocation</br>, and for which classes of valuations? (ii) In cases where the <br>optimal allocation</br> cannot be determined by ascending auctions, how well can such auctions approximate the social welfare? (iii) How do the different models for ascending auctions compare?",
                "Are some models computationally stronger than others?",
                "Ascending auctions have been extensively studied in the literature (see the recent survey by Parkes [35]).",
                "Most of this work presented upper bounds, i.e., proposed mechanisms with ascending prices and analyzed their properties.",
                "A result which is closer in spirit to ours, is by Gul and Stacchetti [17], who showed that no item-price ascending auction can always determine the VCG prices, even for substitutes valuations.2 Our framework is more general than the traditional line of research that concentrates on the final allocation and 1 We do observe however that some weak incentive property comes for free in demand-query auctions since myopic players will answer all demand queries truthfully.",
                "We also note that in some cases (but not always!) the incentives issues can be handled orthogonally to the preference elicitation issues, e.g., by using Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) prices (e.g., [4, 34]). 2 We further discuss this result in Section 5.3.",

                "First, ascending auctions are widely used in many real-life settings from the FCC spectrum auctions [15] to almost any e-commerce website (e.g., [2, 1]).",
                "Actually, this is maybe the most straightforward way to sell items: ask the bidders what would they like to buy under certain prices, and increase the prices of over-demanded goods.",
                "Ascending auctions are also considered more intuitive for many bidders, and are believed to increase the trust of the bidders in the auctioneer, as they see the result gradually emerging from the bidders responses.",
                "Ascending auctions also have other desired economic properties, e.g., they incur smaller information revelation (consider, for example, English auctions vs. second-price sealed bid auctions). 1.1 Extant Work Many iterative combinatorial auction mechanisms rely on demand queries (see the survey in [35]).",

                "The design of a combinatorial auction involves many considerations.",
                "In this paper we focus on just one central issue: the communication between bidders and the allocation mechanism - <br>preference elicitation</br>.",
                "Transferring all information about bidders preferences requires an infeasible (exponential in m) amount of communication.",
                "Thus, direct revelation auctions in which bidders simply declare their preferences to the mechanism are only practical for very small auction sizes or for very limited families of bidder preferences.",
                "We have therefore seen a multitude of suggested iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly interacts with the different bidders, aiming to adaptively elicit enough information about the bidders preferences as to be able to find a good (optimal or close to optimal) allocation.",
                "Most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the bundles under the current set of prices, and then updating the set of bundle prices according to the replies received (e.g., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]).",
                "Effectively, such an iterative auction accesses the bidders preferences by repeatedly making the following type of demand query to bidders: Query to bidder i: a vector of bundle prices p = {p(S)}S⊆M ; Answer: a bundle of items S ⊆ M that maximizes vi(S) − p(S)..",
                "These types of queries are very natural in an economic setting as they capture the revealed preferences of the bidders.",
                "Some auctions, called item-price or linear-price auctions, specify a price pi for each item, and the price of any given bundle S is always linear, p(S) = P i∈S pi.",
                "Other auctions, called bundle-price auctions, allow specifying arbitrary (non-linear) prices p(S) for bundles.",
                "Another important differentiation between models of iterative auctions is 29 based on whether they use anonymous or non-anonymous prices: In some auctions the prices that are presented to the bidders are always the same (anonymous prices).",
                "In other auctions (non-anonymous), different bidders may face different (discriminatory) vectors of prices.",
                "In ascending-price auctions, forcing prices to be anonymous may be a significant restriction.",

                "We do not aim to present auctions for practical use but rather to understand the limitations and possibilities of these kinds of auctions.",
                "In the first part of this paper, our main question is what can be done using a polynomial number of these types of queries?",
                "That is, polynomial in the main parameters of the problem: n, m and the number of bits t needed for representing a single value vi(S).",
                "Note that from an algorithmic point of view we are talking about sub-linear time algorithms: the input size here is really n(2m − 1) numbers - the descriptions of the valuation functions of all bidders.",
                "There are two aspects to computational efficiency in these settings: the first is the communication with the bidders, i.e., the number of queries made, and the second is the usual computational tractability.",
                "Our lower bounds will depend only on the number of queriesand hold independently of any computational assumptions like P = NP.",
                "Our upper bounds will always be computationally efficient both in terms of the number of queries and in terms of regular computation.",
                "As mentioned, this paper concentrates on the single aspect of <br>preference elicitation</br> and on its computational consequences and does not address issues of incentives.",
                "This strengthens our lower bounds, but means that the upper bounds require evaluation from this perspective also before being used in any real combinatorial auction.1 The second part of this paper studies the power of ascending -price auctions.",
                "Ascending auctions are iterative auctions where the published prices cannot decrease in time.",
                "In this work, we try to systematically analyze what do the differences between various models of ascending auctions mean.",
                "We try to answer the following questions: (i) Which models of ascending auctions can find the optimal allocation, and for which classes of valuations? (ii) In cases where the optimal allocation cannot be determined by ascending auctions, how well can such auctions approximate the social welfare? (iii) How do the different models for ascending auctions compare?",
                "Are some models computationally stronger than others?",
                "Ascending auctions have been extensively studied in the literature (see the recent survey by Parkes [35]).",
                "Most of this work presented upper bounds, i.e., proposed mechanisms with ascending prices and analyzed their properties.",
                "A result which is closer in spirit to ours, is by Gul and Stacchetti [17], who showed that no item-price ascending auction can always determine the VCG prices, even for substitutes valuations.2 Our framework is more general than the traditional line of research that concentrates on the final allocation and 1 We do observe however that some weak incentive property comes for free in demand-query auctions since myopic players will answer all demand queries truthfully.",
                "We also note that in some cases (but not always!) the incentives issues can be handled orthogonally to the <br>preference elicitation</br> issues, e.g., by using Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) prices (e.g., [4, 34]). 2 We further discuss this result in Section 5.3.",

                "First, ascending auctions are widely used in many real-life settings from the FCC spectrum auctions [15] to almost any e-commerce website (e.g., [2, 1]).",
                "Actually, this is maybe the most straightforward way to sell items: ask the bidders what would they like to buy under certain prices, and increase the prices of over-demanded goods.",
                "Ascending auctions are also considered more intuitive for many bidders, and are believed to increase the trust of the bidders in the auctioneer, as they see the result gradually emerging from the bidders responses.",

                "The main lower bound in this area, due to [32], states that indeed, due to inherent communication requirements, it is not possible for any iterative auction to find the optimal allocation among general valuations with sub-exponentially many queries.",

                "In [32], the universal generality of demand queries is also shown: any non-deterministic communication protocol for finding an allocation that optimizes the social welfare can be converted into one that only uses demand queries (with bundle prices).",
                "In [41] this was generalized also to nondeterministic protocols for finding allocations that satisfy other natural types of economic requirements (e.g., approximate social efficiency, envy-freeness).",
                "However, in [33] it was demonstrated that this completeness of demand queries holds only in the nondeterministic setting, while in the usual deterministic setting, demand queries (even with bundle prices) may be exponentially weaker than general communication.",

                "The usual goal of the auctioneer is to optimize the social welfare P i vi(Si), where the allocation S1...Sn must be a partition of the items.",

                "The design of a combinatorial auction involves many considerations.",
                "In this paper we focus on just one central issue: the communication between bidders and the allocation mechanism - preference elicitation.",
                "Transferring all information about bidders preferences requires an infeasible (exponential in m) amount of communication.",
                "Thus, direct revelation auctions in which bidders simply declare their preferences to the mechanism are only practical for very small auction sizes or for very limited families of bidder preferences.",
                "We have therefore seen a multitude of suggested iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly interacts with the different bidders, aiming to adaptively elicit enough information about the bidders preferences as to be able to find a good (optimal or close to optimal) allocation.",
                "Most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the bundles under the current set of prices, and then updating the set of bundle prices according to the replies received (e.g., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]).",
                "Effectively, such an iterative auction accesses the bidders preferences by repeatedly making the following type of demand query to bidders: Query to bidder i: a vector of bundle prices p = {p(S)}S⊆M ; Answer: a bundle of items S ⊆ M that maximizes vi(S) − p(S)..",
                "These types of queries are very natural in an economic setting as they capture the revealed preferences of the bidders.",
                "Some auctions, called item-price or linear-price auctions, specify a price pi for each item, and the price of any given bundle S is always linear, p(S) = P i∈S pi.",
                "Other auctions, called bundle-price auctions, allow specifying arbitrary (non-linear) prices p(S) for bundles.",
                "Another important differentiation between models of iterative auctions is 29 based on whether they use anonymous or non-anonymous prices: In some auctions the prices that are presented to the bidders are always the same (anonymous prices).",
                "In other auctions (non-anonymous), different bidders may face different (discriminatory) vectors of prices.",
                "In ascending-price auctions, forcing prices to be anonymous may be a significant restriction.",

                "In the first part of this paper, our main question is what can be done using a polynomial number of these types of queries?",
                "That is, polynomial in the main parameters of the problem: n, m and the number of bits t needed for representing a single value vi(S).",
                "Note that from an algorithmic point of view we are talking about sub-linear time algorithms: the input size here is really n(2m − 1) numbers - the descriptions of the valuation functions of all bidders.",
                "There are two aspects to computational efficiency in these settings: the first is the communication with the bidders, i.e., the number of queries made, and the second is the usual computational tractability.",
                "Our lower bounds will depend only on the number of queriesand hold independently of any computational assumptions like P = NP.",
                "Our upper bounds will always be computationally efficient both in terms of the number of queries and in terms of regular computation.",
                "As mentioned, this paper concentrates on the single aspect of preference elicitation and on its computational consequences and does not address issues of incentives.",
                "This strengthens our lower bounds, but means that the upper bounds require evaluation from this perspective also before being used in any real combinatorial auction.1 The second part of this paper studies the power of ascending -price auctions.",
                "Ascending auctions are iterative auctions where the published prices cannot decrease in time.",
                "In this work, we try to systematically analyze what do the differences between various models of ascending auctions mean.",
                "We try to answer the following questions: (i) Which models of ascending auctions can find the optimal allocation, and for which classes of valuations? (ii) In cases where the optimal allocation cannot be determined by ascending auctions, how well can such auctions approximate the social welfare? (iii) How do the different models for ascending auctions compare?",
                "Are some models computationally stronger than others?",
                "Ascending auctions have been extensively studied in the literature (see the recent survey by Parkes [35]).",
                "Most of this work presented upper bounds, i.e., proposed mechanisms with ascending prices and analyzed their properties.",
                "A result which is closer in spirit to ours, is by Gul and Stacchetti [17], who showed that no item-price ascending auction can always determine the VCG prices, even for substitutes valuations.2 Our framework is more general than the traditional line of research that concentrates on the final allocation and 1 We do observe however that some weak incentive property comes for free in demand-query auctions since myopic players will answer all demand queries truthfully.",
                "We also note that in some cases (but not always!) the incentives issues can be handled orthogonally to the preference elicitation issues, e.g., by using Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) prices (e.g., [4, 34]). 2 We further discuss this result in Section 5.3.",

                "Ascending auctions are also considered more intuitive for many bidders, and are believed to increase the trust of the bidders in the auctioneer, as they see the result gradually emerging from the bidders responses.",

                "In [32], the universal generality of demand queries is also shown: any non-deterministic communication protocol for finding an allocation that optimizes the social welfare can be converted into one that only uses demand queries (with bundle prices).",
                "In [41] this was generalized also to nondeterministic protocols for finding allocations that satisfy other natural types of economic requirements (e.g., approximate social efficiency, envy-freeness).",
                "However, in [33] it was demonstrated that this completeness of demand queries holds only in the nondeterministic setting, while in the usual deterministic setting, demand queries (even with bundle prices) may be exponentially weaker than general communication.",

                "The preferences of bidder i are specified by a valuation function vi : 2M → R+ , where vi(S) denotes the value that bidder i attaches to winning the bundle of items S. We assume free disposal, i.e., that the vis are monotone non-decreasing.",

                "The design of a combinatorial auction involves many considerations.",
                "In this paper we focus on just one central issue: the communication between bidders and the allocation mechanism - preference elicitation.",
                "Transferring all information about bidders preferences requires an infeasible (exponential in m) amount of communication.",
                "Thus, direct revelation auctions in which bidders simply declare their preferences to the mechanism are only practical for very small auction sizes or for very limited families of bidder preferences.",
                "We have therefore seen a multitude of suggested iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly interacts with the different bidders, aiming to adaptively elicit enough information about the bidders preferences as to be able to find a good (optimal or close to optimal) allocation.",
                "Most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the bundles under the current set of prices, and then updating the set of bundle prices according to the replies received (e.g., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]).",
                "Effectively, such an iterative auction accesses the bidders preferences by repeatedly making the following type of demand query to bidders: Query to bidder i: a vector of bundle prices p = {p(S)}S⊆M ; Answer: a bundle of items S ⊆ M that maximizes vi(S) − p(S)..",
                "These types of queries are very natural in an economic setting as they capture the revealed preferences of the bidders.",
                "Some auctions, called item-price or linear-price auctions, specify a price pi for each item, and the price of any given bundle S is always linear, p(S) = P i∈S pi.",
                "Other auctions, called bundle-price auctions, allow specifying arbitrary (non-linear) prices p(S) for bundles.",
                "Another important differentiation between models of iterative auctions is 29 based on whether they use anonymous or non-anonymous prices: In some auctions the prices that are presented to the bidders are always the same (anonymous prices).",
                "In other auctions (non-anonymous), different bidders may face different (discriminatory) vectors of prices.",
                "In ascending-price auctions, forcing prices to be anonymous may be a significant restriction.",
                "In this paper, we embark on a systematic analysis of the computational power of iterative auctions that are based on demand queries.",
                "We do not aim to present auctions for practical use but rather to understand the limitations and possibilities of these kinds of auctions.",
                "In the first part of this paper, our main question is what can be done using a polynomial number of these types of queries?",
                "That is, polynomial in the main parameters of the problem: n, m and the number of bits t needed for representing a single value vi(S).",
                "Note that from an algorithmic point of view we are talking about sub-linear time algorithms: the input size here is really n(2m − 1) numbers - the descriptions of the valuation functions of all bidders.",
                "There are two aspects to computational efficiency in these settings: the first is the communication with the bidders, i.e., the number of queries made, and the second is the usual computational tractability.",
                "Our lower bounds will depend only on the number of queriesand hold independently of any computational assumptions like P = NP.",
                "Our upper bounds will always be computationally efficient both in terms of the number of queries and in terms of regular computation.",
                "As mentioned, this paper concentrates on the single aspect of preference elicitation and on its computational consequences and does not address issues of incentives.",
                "This strengthens our lower bounds, but means that the upper bounds require evaluation from this perspective also before being used in any real combinatorial auction.1 The second part of this paper studies the power of ascending -price auctions.",
                "Ascending auctions are iterative auctions where the published prices cannot decrease in time.",
                "In this work, we try to systematically analyze what do the differences between various models of ascending auctions mean.",
                "We try to answer the following questions: (i) Which models of ascending auctions can find the optimal allocation, and for which classes of valuations? (ii) In cases where the optimal allocation cannot be determined by ascending auctions, how well can such auctions approximate the social welfare? (iii) How do the different models for ascending auctions compare?",
                "Are some models computationally stronger than others?",
                "Ascending auctions have been extensively studied in the literature (see the recent survey by Parkes [35]).",
                "Most of this work presented upper bounds, i.e., proposed mechanisms with ascending prices and analyzed their properties.",
                "A result which is closer in spirit to ours, is by Gul and Stacchetti [17], who showed that no item-price ascending auction can always determine the VCG prices, even for substitutes valuations.2 Our framework is more general than the traditional line of research that concentrates on the final allocation and 1 We do observe however that some weak incentive property comes for free in demand-query auctions since myopic players will answer all demand queries truthfully.",
                "We also note that in some cases (but not always!) the incentives issues can be handled orthogonally to the preference elicitation issues, e.g., by using Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) prices (e.g., [4, 34]). 2 We further discuss this result in Section 5.3.",

                "Ascending auctions are also considered more intuitive for many bidders, and are believed to increase the trust of the bidders in the auctioneer, as they see the result gradually emerging from the bidders responses.",

                "In [32], the universal generality of demand queries is also shown: any non-deterministic communication protocol for finding an allocation that optimizes the social welfare can be converted into one that only uses demand queries (with bundle prices).",
