This work has established the space in which agents are permitted to interact through dialogues. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the mechanisms agents might use to choose how to act - the rhetorical manoeuvring that they use to navigate through the space defined by the rules of the dialogue. Key in such considerations is the idea of relevance, since a usual requirement is that agents stay focussed on the subject of the dialogue and only make relevant remarks. Here we study several notions of relevance, showing how they can be related to both the rules for carrying out dialogues and to rhetorical manoeuvring.

One mechanism for achieving agreement is through the use of argumentation - where one agent tries to convince another agent of something during the course of some dialogue. Early examples of argumentation-based approaches to multiagent agreement include the work of Dignum et al. [7], Kraus [14], Parsons and Jennings [16], Reed [23], Schroeder et al. [25] and Sycara [26]. The work of Walton and Krabbe [27], popularised in the multiagent systems community by Reed [23], has been particularly influential in the field of argumentation-based dialogue. This work influenced the field in a number of ways, perhaps most deeply in framing multi-agent interactions as dialogue games in the tradition of Hamblin [13]. Viewing dialogues in this way, as in [2, 21], provides a powerful framework for analysing the formal properties of dialogues, and for identifying suitable protocols under which dialogues can be conducted [18, 20]. The dialogue game view overlaps with work on conversation policies (see, for example, [6, 10]), but differs in considering the entire dialogue rather than dialogue segments. In this paper, we extend the work of [18] by considering the role of relevance - the relationship between utterances in a dialogue. Relevance is a topic of increasing interest in argumentation-based dialogue because it relates to the scope that an agent has for applying strategic manoeuvering to obtain the outcomes that it requires [19, 22, 24]. Our work identifes the limits on such rhetorical manoeuvering, showing when it can and cannot have an effect. 2. BACKGROUND We begin by introducing the formal system of argumentation that underpins our approach, as well as the corresponding terminology and notation, all taken from [2, 8, 17]. A dialogue is a sequence of messages passed between two or more members of a set of agents A. An agent α maintains a knowledge base, Σα, containing formulas of a propositional language L and having no deductive closure. Agent α also maintains the set of its past utterances, called the commitment store, CSα. We refer to this as an agents public knowledge, since it contains information that is shared with other agents. In contrast, the contents of Σα are private to α. Note that in the description that follows, we assume that is the classical inference relation, that ≡ stands for logical equivalence, and we use Δ to denote all the information available to an agent. Thus in a dialogue between two agents α and β, Δα = Σα ∪ CSα ∪ CSβ, so the commitment store CSα can be loosely thought of as a subset of Δα consisting of the assertions that have been made public. In some dialogue games, such as those in [18] anything in CSα is either in Σα or can be derived from it. In other dialogue games, such as 1006 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS those in [2], CSα may contain things that cannot be derived from Σα. Definition 2.1. An argument A is a pair (S, p) where p is a formula of L and S a subset of Δ such that (i) S is consistent; (ii) S p; and (iii) S is minimal, so no proper subset of S satisfying both (1) and (2) exists. S is called the support of A, written S = Support(A) and p is the conclusion of A, written p = Conclusion(A). Thus we talk of p being supported by the argument (S, p). In general, since Δ may be inconsistent, arguments in A(Δ), the set of all arguments which can be made from Δ, may conflict, and we make this idea precise with the notion of undercutting: Definition 2.2. Let A1 and A2 be arguments in A(Δ). A1 undercuts A2 iff ∃¬p ∈ Support(A2) such that p ≡ Conclusion(A1). In other words, an argument is undercut if and only if there is another argument which has as its conclusion the negation of an element of the support for the first argument. To capture the fact that some beliefs are more strongly held than others, we assume that any set of beliefs has a preference order over it. We consider all information available to an agent, Δ, to be stratified into non-overlapping subsets Δ1, . . . , Δn such that beliefs in Δi are all equally preferred and are preferred over elements in Δj where i > j. The preference level of a nonempty subset S ⊂ Δ, where different elements s ∈ S may belong to different layers Δi, is valued at the highest numbered layer which has a member in S and is referred to as level(S). In other words, S is only as strong as its weakest member. Note that the strength of a belief as used in this context is a separate concept from the notion of support discussed earlier. Definition 2.3. Let A1 and A2 be arguments in A(Δ). A1 is preferred to A2 according to Pref , A1 Pref A2, iff level(Support(A1)) > level(Support(A2)). If A1 is preferred to A2, we say that A1 is stronger than A2. We can now define the argumentation system we will use: Definition 2.4. An argumentation system is a triple: A(Δ), Undercut, Pref such that: • A(Δ) is a set of the arguments built from Δ, • Undercut is a binary relation representing the defeat relationship between arguments, Undercut ⊆ A(Δ) × A(Δ), and • Pref is a pre-ordering on A(Δ) × A(Δ). The preference order makes it possible to distinguish different types of relations between arguments: Definition 2.5. Let A1, A2 be two arguments of A(Δ). • If A2 undercuts A1 then A1 defends itself against A2 iff A1 Pref A2. Otherwise, A1 does not defend itself. • A set of arguments A defends A1 iff for every A2 that undercuts A1, where A1 does not defend itself against A2, then there is some A3 ∈ A such that A3 undercuts A2 and A2 does not defend itself against A3. We write AUndercut,Pref to denote the set of all non-undercut arguments and arguments defending themselves against all their undercutting arguments. The set A(Δ) of acceptable arguments of the argumentation system A(Δ), Undercut, Pref is [1] the least fixpoint of a function F: A ⊆ A(Δ) F(A) = {(S, p) ∈ A(Δ) | (S, p) is defended by A} Definition 2.6. The set of acceptable arguments for an argumentation system A(Δ), Undercut, Pref is recursively defined as: A(Δ) = [ Fi≥0(∅) = AUndercut,Pref ∪ h[ Fi≥1(AUndercut,Pref ) i An argument is acceptable if it is a member of the acceptable set, and a proposition is acceptable if it is the conclusion of an acceptable argument. An acceptable argument is one which is, in some sense, proven since all the arguments which might undermine it are themselves undermined. Definition 2.7. If there is an acceptable argument for a proposition p, then the status of p is accepted, while if there is not an acceptable argument for p, the status of p is not accepted. Argument A is said to affect the status of another argument A if changing the status of A will change the status of A . 3. DIALOGUES Systems like those described in [2, 18], lay down sets of locutions that agents can make to put forward propositions and the arguments that support them, and protocols that define precisely which locutions can be made at which points in the dialogue. We are not concerned with such a level of detail here. Instead we are interested in the interplay between arguments that agents put forth. As a result, we will consider only that agents are allowed to put forward arguments. We do not discuss the detail of the mechanism that is used to put these arguments forward - we just assume that arguments of the form (S, p) are inserted into an agents commitment store where they are then visible to other agents. We then have a typical definition of a dialogue: Definition 3.1. A dialogue D is a sequence of moves: m1, m2, . . . , mn. A given move mi is a pair α, Ai where Ai is an argument that α places into its commitment store CSα. Moves in an argumentation-based dialogue typically attack moves that have been made previously. While, in general, a dialogue can include moves that undercut several arguments, in the remainder of this paper, we will only consider dialogues that put forward moves that undercut at most one argument. For now we place no additional constraints on the moves that make up a dialogue. Later we will see how different restrictions on moves lead to different kinds of dialogue. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1007 The sequence of arguments put forward in the dialogue is determined by the agents who are taking part in the dialogue, but they are usually not completely free to choose what arguments they make. As indicated earlier, their choice is typically limited by a protocol. If we write the sequence of n moves m1, m2, . . . , mn as mn, and denote the empty sequence as m0, then we can define a profocol in the following way: Definition 3.2. A protocol P is a function on a sequence of moves mi in a dialogue D that, for all i ≥ 0, identifies a set of possible moves Mi+1 from which the mi+1th move may be drawn: P : mi → Mi+1 In other words, for our purposes here, at every point in a dialogue, a protocol determines a set of possible moves that agents may make as part of the dialogue. If a dialogue D always picks its moves m from the set M identified by protocol P, then D is said to conform to P. Even if a dialogue conforms to a protocol, it is typically the case that the agent engaging in the dialogue has to make a choice of move - it has to choose which of the moves in M to make. This excercise of choice is what we refer to as an agents use of rhetoric (in its oratorical sense of influencing the thought and conduct of an audience). Some of our results will give a sense of how much scope an agent has to exercise rhetoric under different protocols. As arguments are placed into commitment stores, and hence become public, agents can determine the relationships between them. In general, after several moves in a dialogue, some arguments will undercut others. We will denote the set of arguments {A1, A2, . . . , Aj} asserted after moves m1, m2, . . . , mj of a dialogue to be Aj - the relationship of the arguments in Aj can be described as an argumentation graph, similar to those described in, for example, [3, 4, 9]: Definition 3.3. An argumentation graph AG over a set of arguments A is a directed graph (V, E) such that every vertex v, v ∈ V denotes one argument A ∈ A, every argument A is denoted by one vertex v, and every directed edge e ∈ E from v to v denotes that v undercuts v . We will use the term argument graph as a synonym for argumentation graph. Note that we do not require that the argumentation graph is connected. In other words the notion of an argumentation graph allows for the representation of arguments that do not relate, by undercutting or being undercut, to any other arguments (we will come back to this point very shortly). We adapt some standard graph theoretic notions in order to describe various aspects of the argumentation graph. If there is an edge e from vertex v to vertex v , then v is said to be the parent of v and v is said to be the child of v. In a reversal of the usual notion, we define a root of an argumentation graph1 as follows: Definition 3.4. A root of an argumentation graph AG = (V, E) is a node v ∈ V that has no children. Thus a root of a graph is a node to which directed edges may be connected, but from which no directed edges connect to other nodes. Thus a root is a node representing an 1 Note that we talk of a root rather than the root - as defined, an argumentation graph need not be a tree. v v Figure 1: An example argument graph argument that is undercut, but which itself does no undercutting. Similarly: Definition 3.5. A leaf of an argumentation graph AG = (V, E) is a node v ∈ V that has no parents. Thus a leaf in an argumentation graph represents an argument that undercuts another argument, but does no undercutting. Thus in Figure 1, v is a root, and v is a leaf. The reason for the reversal of the usual notions of root and leaf is that, as we shall see, we will consider dialogues to construct argumentation graphs from the roots (in our sense) to the leaves. The reversal of the terminology means that it matches the natural process of tree construction. Since, as described above, argumentation graphs are allowed to be not connected (in the usual graph theory sense), it is helpful to distinguish nodes that are connected to other nodes, in particular to the root of the tree. We say that node v is connected to node v if and only if there is a path from v to v . Since edges represent undercut relations, the notion of connectedness between nodes captures the influence that one argument may have on another: Proposition 3.1. Given an argumentation graph AG, if there is any argument A, denoted by node v that affects the status of another argument A , denoted by v , then v is connected to v . The converse does not hold. Proof. Given Definitions 2.5 and 2.6, the only ways in which A can affect the status of A is if A either undercuts A , or if A undercuts some argument A that undercuts A , or if A undercuts some A that undercuts some A that undercuts A , and so on. In all such cases, a sequence of undercut relations relates the two arguments, and if they are both in an argumentation graph, this means that they are connected. Since the notion of path ignores the direction of the directed arcs, nodes v and v are connected whether the edge between them runs from v to v or vice versa. Since A only undercuts A if the edge runs from v to v , we cannot infer that A will affect the status of A from information about whether or not they are connected. The reason that we need the concept of the argumentation graph is that the properties of the argumentation graph tell us something about the set of arguments A the graph represents. When that set of arguments is constructed through a dialogue, there is a relationship between the structure of the argumentation graph and the protocol that governs the dialogue. It is the extent of the relationship between structure and protocol that is the main subject of this paper. To study this relationship, we need to establish a correspondence between a dialogue and an argumentation graph. Given the definitions we have so far, this is simple: Definition 3.6. A dialogue D, consisting of a sequence of moves mn, and an argument graph AG = (V, E) correspond to one another iff ∀m ∈ mn, the argument Ai that 1008 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) is advanced at move mi is represented by exactly one node v ∈ V , and ∀v ∈ V , v represents exactly one argument Ai that has been advanced by a move m ∈ mn. Thus a dialogue corresponds to an argumentation graph if and only if every argument made in the dialogue corresponds to a node in the graph, and every node in the graph corresponds to an argument made in the dialogue. This one-toone correspondence allows us to consider each node v in the graph to have an index i which is the index of the move in the dialogue that put forward the argument which that node represents. Thus we can, for example, refer to the third node in the argumentation graph, meaning the node that represents the argument put forward in the third move of the dialogue. 4. RELEVANCE Most work on dialogues is concerned with what we might call coherent dialogues, that is dialogues in which the participants are, as in the work of Walton and Krabbe [27], focused on resolving some question through the dialogue2 To capture this coherence, it seems we need a notion of relevance to constrain the statements made by agents. Here we study three notions of relevance: Definition 4.1. Consider a dialogue D, consisting of a sequence of moves mi, with a corresponding argument graph AG. The move mi+1, i > 1, is said to be relevant if one or more of the following hold: R1 Making mi+1 will change the status of the argument denoted by the first node of AG. R2 Making mi+1 will add a node vi+1 that is connected to the first node of AG. R3 Making mi+1 will add a node vi+1 that is connected to the last node to be added to AG. R2-relevance is the form of relevance defined by [3] in their study of strategic and tactical reasoning3 . R1-relevance was suggested by the notion used in [15], and though it differs somewhat from that suggested there, we believe it captures the essence of its predecessor. Note that we only define relevance for the second move of the dialogue onwards because the first move is taken to identify the subject of the dialogue, that is, the central question that the dialogue is intended to answer, and hence it must be relevant to the dialogue, no matter what it is. In assuming this, we focus our attention on the same kind of dialogues as [18]. We can think of relevance as enforcing a form of parsimony on a dialogue - it prevents agents from making statements that do not bear on the current state of the dialogue. This promotes efficiency, in the sense of limiting the number of moves in the dialogue, and, as in [15], prevents agents revealing information that they might better keep hidden. Another form of parsimony is to insist that agents are not allowed to put forward arguments that will be undercut by arguments that have already been made during the dialogue. We therefore distinguish such arguments. 2 See [11, 12] for examples of dialogues where this is not the case. 3 We consider such reasoning sub-types of rhetoric. Definition 4.2. Consider a dialogue D, consisting of a sequence of moves mi, with a corresponding argument graph AG. The move mi+1 and the argument it puts forward, Ai+1, are both said to be pre-empted, if Ai+1 is undercut by some A ∈ Ai. We use the term pre-empted because if such an argument is put forward, it can seem as though another agent anticipated the argument being made, and already made an argument that would render it useless. In the rest of this paper, we will only deal with protocols that permit moves that are relevant, in any of the senses introduced above, and are not allowed to be pre-empted. We call such protocols basic protocols, and dialogues carried out under such protocols basic dialogues. The argument graph of a basic dialogue is somewhat restricted. Proposition 4.1. Consider a basic dialogue D. The argumentation graph AG that corresponds to D is a tree with a single root. Proof. Recall that Definition 3.3 requires only that AG be a directed graph. To show that it is a tree, we have to show that it is acyclic and connected. That the graph is connected follows from the construction of the graph under a protocol that enforces relevance. If the notion of relevance is R3, each move adds a node that is connected to the previous node. If the notion of relevance is R2, then every move adds a node that is connected to the root, and thus is connected to some node in the graph. If the notion of relevance is R1, then every move has to change the status of the argument denoted by the root. Proposition 3.1 tells us that to affect the status of an argument A , the node v representing the argument A that is effecting the change has to be connected to v , the node representing A , and so it follows that every new node added as a result of an R1relevant move will be connected to the argumentation graph. Thus AG is connected. Since a basic dialogue does not allow moves that are preempted, every edge that is added during construction is directed from the node that is added to one already in the graph (thus denoting that the argument A denoted by the added node, v, undercuts the argument A denoted by the node to which the connection is made, v , rather than the other way around). Since every edge that is added is directed from the new node to the rest of the graph, there can be no cycles. Thus AG is a tree. To show that AG has a single root, consider its construction from the initial node. After m1 the graph has one node, v1 that is both a root and a leaf. After m2, the graph is two nodes connected by an edge, and v1 is now a root and not a leaf. v2 is a leaf and not a root. However the third node is added, the argument earlier in this proof demonstrates that there will be a directed edge from it to some other node, making it a leaf. Thus v1 will always be the only root. The ruling out of pre-empted moves means that v1 will never cease to be a root, and so the argumentation graph will always have one root. Since every argumentation graph constructed by a basic dialogue is a tree with a single root, this means that the first node of every argumentation graph is the root. Although these results are straightforward to obtain, they allow us to show how the notions of relevance are related. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1009 Proposition 4.2. Consider a basic dialogue D, consisting of a sequence of moves mi, with a corresponding argument graph AG. 1. Every move mi+1 that is R1-relevant is R2-relevant. The converse does not hold. 2. Every move mi+1 that is R3-relevant is R2-relevant. The converse does not hold. 3. Not every move mi+1 that is R1-relevant is R3-relevant, and not every move mi+1 that is R3-relevant is R1relevant Proof. For 1, consider how move mi+1 can satisfy R1. Proposition 3.1 tells us that if Ai+1 can change the status of the argument denoted by the root v1 (which, as observed above, is the first node) of AG, then vi+1 must be connected to the root. This is precisely what is required to satisfy R2, and the relatiosnhip is proved to hold. To see that the converse does not hold, we have to consider what it takes to change the status of r (since Proposition 3.1 tells us that connectedness is not enough to ensure a change of status - if it did, R1 and R2 relevance would coincide). For mi+1 to change the status of the root, it will have to (1) make the argument A represented by r either unacceptable, if it were acceptable before the move, or (2) acceptable if it were unacceptable before the move. Given the definition of acceptability, it can achieve (1) either by directly undercutting the argument represented by r, in which case vi+1 will be directly connected to r by some edge, or by undercutting some argument A that is part of the set of non-undercut arguments defending A. In the latter case, vi+1 will be directly connected to the node representing A and by Proposition 4.1 to r. To achieve (2), vi+1 will have to undercut an argument A that is either currently undercutting A, or is undercutting an argument that would otherwise defend A. Now, further consider that mi+1 puts forward an argument Ai+1 that undercuts the argument denoted by some node v , but this latter argument defends itself against Ai+1. In such a case, the set of acceptable arguments will not change, and so the status of Ar will not change. Thus a move that is R2-relevant need not be R1-relevant. For 2, consider that mi+1 can satisfy R3 simply by adding a node that is connected to vi, the last node to be added to AG. By Proposition 4.1, it is connected to r and so is R2-relevant. To see that the converse does not hold, consider that an R2-relevant move can connect to any node in AG. The first part of 3 follows by a similar argument to that we just used - an R1-relevant move does not have to connect to vi, just to some v that is part of the graph - and the second part follows since a move that is R3-relevant may introduce an argument Ai+1 that undercuts the argument Ai put forward by the previous move (and so vi+1 is connected to vi), but finds that Ai defends itself against Ai+1, preventing a change of status at the root. What is most interesting is not so much the results but why they hold, since this reveals some aspects of the interplay between relevance and the structure of argument graphs. For example, to restate a case from the proof of Proposition 4.2, a move that is R3-relevant by definition has to add a node to the argument graph that is connected to the last node that was added. Since a move that is R2-relevant can add a node that connects anywhere on an argument graph, any move that is R3-relevant will be R2-relevant, but the converse does not hold. It turns out that we can exploit the interplay between structure and relevance that Propositions 4.1 and 4.2 have started to illuminate to establish relationships between the protocols that govern dialogues and the argument graphs constructed during such dialogues. To do this we need to define protocols in such a way that they refer to the structure of the graph. We have: Definition 4.3. A protocol is single-path if all dialogues that conform to it construct argument graphs that have only one branch. Proposition 4.3. A basic protocol P is single-path if, for all i, the set of permitted moves Mi at move i are all R3relevant. The converse does not hold. Proof. R3-relevance requires that every node added to the argument graph be connected to the previous node. Starting from the first node this recursively constructs a tree with just one branch, and the relationship holds. The converse does not hold because even if one or more moves in the protocol are R1- or R2-relevant, it may be the case that, because of an agents rhetorical choice or because of its knowledge, every argument that is chosen to be put forward will undercut the previous argument and so the argument graph is a one-branch tree. Looking for more complex kinds of protocol that construct more complex kinds of argument graph, it is an obvious move to turn to: Definition 4.4. A basic protocol is multi-path if all dialogues that conform to it can construct argument graphs that are trees. But, on reflection, since any graph with only one branch is also a tree: Proposition 4.4. Any single-path protocol is an instance of a multi-path protocol. and, furthermore: Proposition 4.5. Any basic protocol P is multi-path. Proof. Immediate from Proposition 4.1 So the notion of a multi-path protocol does not have much traction. As a result we distinguish multi-path protocols that permit dialogues that can construct trees that have more than one branch as bushy protocols. We then have: Proposition 4.6. A basic protocol P is bushy if, for some i, the set of permitted moves Mi at move i are all R1- or R2-relevant. Proof. From Proposition 4.3 we know that if all moves are R3-relevant then well get a tree with one branch, and from Proposition 4.1 we know that all basic protocols will build an argument graph that is a tree, so providing we exclude R3-relevant moves, we will get protocols that can build multi-branch trees. 1010 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Of course, since, by Proposition 4.2, any move that is R3relevant is R2-relevant and can quite possibly be R1-relevant (all that Proposition 4.2 tells us is that there is no guarantee that it will be), all that Proposition 4.6 tells us is that dialogues that conform to bushy protocols may have more than one branch. All we can do is to identify a bound on the number of branches: Proposition 4.7. Consider a basic dialogue D that includes m moves that are not R3-relevant, and has a corresponding argumentation graph AG. The number of branches in AG is less than or equal to m + 1. Proof. Since it must connect a node to the last node added to AG, an R3-relevant move can only extend an existing branch. Since they do not have the same restriction, R1 and R2-relevant moves may create a new branch by connecting to a node that is not the last node added. Every such move could create a new branch, and if they do, we will have m branches. If there were R3-relevant moves before any of these new-branch-creating moves, then these m branches are in addition to the initial branch created by the R3-relevant moves, and we have a maximum of m + 1 possible branches. We distinguish bushy protocols from multi-path protocols, and hence R1- and R2-relevance from R3-relevance, because of the kinds of dialogue that R3-relevance enforces. In a dialogue in which all moves must be R3-relevant, the argumentation graph has a single branch - the dialogue consists of a sequence of arguments each of which undercuts the previous one and the last move to be made is the one that settles the dialogue. This, as we will see next, means that such a dialogue only allows a subset of all the moves that would otherwise be possible. 5. COMPLETENESS The above discussion of the difference between dialogues carried out under single-path and bushy protocols brings us to the consideration of what [18] called predeterminism, but we now prefer to describe using the term completeness. The idea of predeterminism, as described in [18], captures the notion that, under some circumstances, the result of a dialogue can be established without actually having the dialogue - the agents have sufficiently little room for rhetorical manoeuver that were one able to see the contents of all the Σi of all the αi ∈ A, one would be able to identify the outcome of any dialogue on a given subject4 . We develop this idea by considering how the argument graphs constructed by dialogues under different protocols compare to benchmark complete dialogues. We start by developing ideas of what complete might mean. One reasonable definition is that: Definition 5.1. A basic dialogue D between the set of agents A with a corresponding argumentation graph AG is topic-complete if no agent can construct an argument A that undercuts any argument A represented by a node in AG. The argumentation graph constructed by a topic-complete dialogue is called a topic-complete argumentation graph and is denoted AG(D)T . 4 Assuming that the Σi do not change during the dialogue, which is the usual assumption in this kind of dialogue. A dialogue is topic-complete when no agent can add anything that is directly connected to the subject of the dialogue. Some protocols will prevent agents from making moves even though the dialogue is not topic-complete. To distinguish such cases we have: Definition 5.2. A basic dialogue D between the set of agents A with a corresponding argumentation graph AG is protocol-complete under a protocol P if no agent can make a move that adds a node to the argumentation graph that is permitted by P. The argumentation graph constructed by a protocol-complete dialogue is called a protocol-complete argumentation graph and is denoted AG(D)P . Clearly: Proposition 5.1. Any dialogue D under a basic protocol P is protocol-complete if it is topic-complete. The converse does not hold in general. Proof. If D is topic-complete, no agent can make a move that will extend the argumentation graph. This means that no agent can make a move that is permitted by a basic protocol, and so D is also protocol complete. The converse does not hold since some basic dialogues (under a protocol that only permits R3-relevant moves, for example) will not permit certain moves (like the addition of a node that connects to the root of the argumentation graph after more than two moves) that would be allowed in a topiccomplete dialogue. Corollary 5.1. For a basic dialogue D, AG(D)P is a sub-graph of AG(D)T . Obviously, from the definition of a sub-graph, the converse of Corollary 5.1 does not hold in general. The important distinction between topic- and protocolcompleteness is that the former is determined purely by the state of the dialogue - as captured by the argumentation graph - and is thus independent of the protocol, while the latter is determined entirely by the protocol. Any time that a dialogue ends in a state of protocol-completeness rather than topic completeness, it is ending when agents still have things to say but cant because the protocol wont allow them to. With these definitions of completeness, our task is to relate topic-completeness - the property that ensures that agents can say everything that they have to say in a dialogue that is, in some sense, important - to the notions of relevance we have developed - which determine what agents are allowed to say. When we need very specific conditions to make protocol-complete dialogues topic-complete, it means that agents have lots of room for rhetorical maneouver when those conditions are not in force. That is there are many ways they can bring dialogues to a close before everything that can be said has been said. Where few conditions are required, or conditions are absent, then dialogues between agents with the same knowledge will always play out the same way, and rhetoric has no place. We have: Proposition 5.2. A protocol-complete basic dialogue D under a protocol which only allows R3-relevant moves will be topic-complete only when AG(D)T has a single branch in which the nodes are labelled in increasing order from the root. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1011 Proof. Given what we know about R3-relevance, the condition on AG(D)P having a single branch is obvious. This is not a sufficient condition on its own because certain protocols may prevent - through additional restrictions, like strict turn-taking in a multi-party dialogue - all the nodes in AG(D)T , which is not subject to such restrictions, being added to the graph. Only when AG(D)T includes the nodes in the exact order that the corresponding arguments are put forward is it necessary that a topic-complete argumentation graph be constructed. Given Proposition 5.1, these are the conditions under which dialogues conducted under the notion of R3-relevance will always be predetermined, and given how restrictive the conditions are, such dialogues seem to have plenty of room for rhetoric to play a part. To find similar conditions for dialogues composed of R1and R2-relevant moves, we first need to distinguish between them. We can do this in terms of the structure of the argumentation graph: Proposition 5.3. Consider a basic dialogue D, with argumentation graph AG which has root r denoting an argument A. If argument A , denoted by node v is an an R2relevant move m, m is not R1-relevant if and only if: 1. there are two nodes v and v on the path between v and r, and the argument denoted by v defends itself against the argument denoted by v ; or 2. there is an argument A , denoted by node v , that affects the status of A, and the path from v to r has one or more nodes in common with the path from v to r. Proof. For the first condition, consider that since AG is a tree, v is connected to r. Thus there is a series of undercut relations between A and A , and this corrresponds to a path through AG. If this path is the only branch in the tree, then A will affect the status of A unless the chain of affect is broken by an undercut that cant change the status of the undercut argument because the latter defends itself. For the second condition, as for the first, the only way that A cannot affect the status of A is if something is blocking its influence. If this is not due to defending against, it must be because there is some node u on the path that represents an argument whose status is fixed somehow, and that must mean that there is another chain of undercut relations, another branch of the tree, that is incident at u. Since this second branch denotes another chain of arguments, and these affect the status of the argument denoted by u, they must also affect the status of A. Any of these are the A in the condition. So an R2-relevant move m is not R1-relevant if either its effect is blocked because an argument upstream is not strong enough, or because there is another line of argument that is currently determining the status of the argument at the root. This, in turn, means that if the effect is not due to defending against, then there is an alternative move that is R1-relevant - a move that undercuts A in the second condition above5 . We can now show 5 Though whether the agent in question can make such a move is another question. Proposition 5.4. A protocol-complete basic dialogue D will always be topic-complete under a protocol which only includes R2-relevant moves and allows every R2-relevant move to be made. The restriction on R2-relevant rules is exactly that for topiccompleteness, so a dialogue that has only R2-relevant moves will continue until every argument that any agent can make has been put forward. Given this, and what we revealed about R1-relevance in Proposition 5.3, we can see that: Proposition 5.5. A protocol-complete basic dialogue D under a protocol which only includes R1-relevant moves will be topic-complete if AG(D)T : 1. includes no path with adjacent nodes v, denoting A, and v , denoting A , such that A undercuts A and A is stronger that A; and 2. is such that the nodes in every branch have consecutive indices and no node with degree greater than two is an odd number of arcs from a leaf node. Proof. The first condition rules out the first condition in Proposition 5.3, and the second deals with the situation that leads to the second condition in Proposition 5.3. The second condition ensures that each branch is constructed in full before any new branch is added, and when a new branch is added, the argument that is undercut as part of the addition will be acceptable, and so the addition will change the status of the argument denoted by that node, and hence the root. With these conditions, every move required to construct AG(D)T will be permitted and so the dialogue will be topic-complete when every move has been completed. The second part of this result only identifies one possible way to ensure that the second condition in Proposition 5.3 is met, so the converse of this result does not hold. However, what we have is sufficient to answer the question about predetermination that we started with. For dialogues to be predetermined, every move that is R2-relevant must be made. In such cases every dialogue is topic complete. If we do not require that all R2-relevant moves are made, then there is some room for rhetoric - the way in which alternative lines of argument are presented becomes an issue. If moves are forced to be R3-relevant, then there is considerable room for rhetorical play. 6. SUMMARY This paper has studied the different ideas of relevance in argumentation-based dialogue, identifying the relationship between these ideas, and showing how they can impact the extent to which the way that agents choose moves in a dialogue - what some authors have called the strategy and tactics of a dialogue. This extends existing work on relvance, such as [3, 15] by showing how different notions of relevance can have an effect on the outcome of a dialogue, in particular when they render the outcome predetermined. This connection extends the work of [18] which considered dialogue outcome, but stopped short of identifying the conditions under which it is predetermined. There are two ways we are currently trying to extend this work, both of which will generalise the results and extend its applicability. First, we want to relax the restrictions that 1012 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) we have imposed, the exclusion of moves that attack several arguments (without which the argument graph can be mulitply-connected) and the exclusion of pre-empted moves, without which the argument graph can have cycles. Second, we want to extend the ideas of relevance to cope with moves that do not only add undercutting arguments, but also supporting arguments, thus taking account of bipolar argumentation frameworks [5].

Este trabajo ha establecido el espacio en el que los agentes pueden interactuar a través de los diálogos. Recientemente, ha habido creciente interés en los mecanismos que los agentes podrían usar para elegir cómo actuar, la maniobra retórica que usan para navegar a través del espacio definido por las reglas del diálogo. La clave en tales consideraciones es la idea de relevancia, ya que un requisito habitual es que los agentes se mantienen enfocados en el tema del diálogo y solo hacen comentarios relevantes. Aquí estudiamos varias nociones de relevancia, que muestran cómo pueden estar relacionadas con las reglas para llevar a cabo diálogos y con maniobras retóricas.

Términos generales Diseño, idiomas, teoría.1. Introducción Encontrar formas para que los agentes alcancen acuerdos en sistemas multiagentes es un área de investigación activa. Un mecanismo para lograr un acuerdo es mediante el uso de la argumentación, donde un agente intenta convencer a otro agente de algo durante el curso de algún diálogo. Los primeros ejemplos de enfoques basados en argumentación para el acuerdo multiagente incluyen el trabajo de Dignum et al.[7], Kraus [14], Parsons y Jennings [16], Reed [23], Schroeder et al.[25] y Sycara [26]. El trabajo de Walton y Krabbe [27], popularizado en la comunidad de sistemas múltiples por Reed [23], ha sido particularmente influyente en el campo del diálogo basado en la argumentación. Este trabajo influyó en el campo de varias maneras, quizás más profundamente en enmarcar interacciones múltiples como juegos de diálogo en la tradición de Hamblin [13]. Ver los diálogos de esta manera, como en [2, 21], proporciona un marco poderoso para analizar las propiedades formales de los diálogos, y para identificar protocolos adecuados bajo los cuales se pueden realizar diálogos [18, 20]. La vista del juego de diálogo se superpone con el trabajo en las políticas de conversación (ver, por ejemplo, [6, 10]), pero difiere considerando todo el diálogo en lugar de segmentos de diálogo. En este artículo, extendemos el trabajo de [18] considerando el papel de relevancia: la relación entre las expresiones en un diálogo. La relevancia es un tema de creciente interés en el diálogo basado en la argumentación porque se relaciona con el alcance que un agente tiene para aplicar maniobras estratégicas para obtener los resultados que requiere [19, 22, 24]. Nuestro trabajo identifica los límites en tal maniobra retórica, mostrando cuándo puede y no puede tener un efecto.2. Antecedentes comenzamos introduciendo el sistema formal de argumentación que sustenta nuestro enfoque, así como la terminología y notación correspondientes, todas tomadas de [2, 8, 17]. Un diálogo es una secuencia de mensajes pasados entre dos o más miembros de un conjunto de agentes A. Un agente α mantiene una base de conocimiento, σα, que contiene fórmulas de un lenguaje proposicional L y no tiene cierre deductivo. El agente α también mantiene el conjunto de sus expresiones pasadas, llamada tienda de compromiso, CSα. Nos referimos a esto como un conocimiento público de los agentes, ya que contiene información que se comparte con otros agentes. En contraste, el contenido de σα es privado a α. Tenga en cuenta que en la descripción que sigue, suponemos que esa es la relación de inferencia clásica, que ≡ representa la equivalencia lógica, y usamos δ para denotar toda la información disponible para un agente. Por lo tanto, en un diálogo entre dos agentes α y β, Δα = σα ∪ CSα ∪ CSβ, por lo que el almacén de compromiso CSα puede considerarse libremente como un subconjunto de Δα que consiste en las afirmaciones que se han hecho públicas. En algunos juegos de diálogo, como los de [18] cualquier cosa en CSα está en σα o puede derivarse de él. En otros juegos de diálogo, como 1006 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 Ifaamas en [2], CSα puede contener cosas que no pueden derivarse de σα. Un argumento A es un par (S, P) donde P es una fórmula de L y S un subconjunto de δ tal que (i) s es consistente;(ii) s p;y (iii) s es mínimo, por lo que no existe un subconjunto adecuado de S que satisfaga (1) y (2). S se llama apoyo de a, escrito s = apoyo (a) y p es la conclusión de a, escrita p = conclusión (a). Así hablamos de que P es apoyado por el argumento (S, P). En general, dado que δ puede ser inconsistente, los argumentos en un (δ), el conjunto de todos los argumentos que se pueden hacer a partir de δ, pueden entrar en conflicto, y hacemos que esta idea sea precisa con la noción de socavación: definición 2.2. Deje que A1 y A2 sean argumentos en A (δ). A1 socava A2 IFF ∃¬P ∈ Soporte (A2) de modo que P ≡ Conclusión (A1). En otras palabras, un argumento está socavado si y solo si hay otro argumento que tiene como conclusión la negación de un elemento del apoyo para el primer argumento. Para capturar el hecho de que algunas creencias se sostienen con más fuerza que otras, suponemos que cualquier conjunto de creencias tiene una orden de preferencia sobre él. Consideramos que toda la información disponible para un agente, δ, se estratifica en subconjuntos no superpuestos Δ1 ,..., Δn de tal manera que las creencias en Δi son igualmente preferidas y se prefieren sobre los elementos en ΔJ donde i> j. El nivel de preferencia de un subconjunto no vacío S ⊂ δ, donde diferentes elementos S ∈ S pueden pertenecer a diferentes capas Δi, se valora en la capa más alta numerada que tiene un miembro en S y se conoce como nivel (s). En otras palabras, S es tan fuerte como su miembro más débil. Tenga en cuenta que la fortaleza de una creencia utilizada en este contexto es un concepto separado de la noción de apoyo discutida anteriormente. Deje que A1 y A2 sean argumentos en A (δ). A1 se prefiere a A2 de acuerdo con pref, A1 pref A2, nivel IFF (soporte (A1))> nivel (soporte (A2)). Si A1 se prefiere a A2, decimos que A1 es más fuerte que A2. Ahora podemos definir el sistema de argumentación que utilizaremos: Definición 2.4. Un sistema de argumentación es un triple: A (δ), encubierto, pref de tal manera que: • A (δ) es un conjunto de los argumentos construidos a partir de δ, • Sub -bins es una relación binaria que representa la relación de derrota entre los argumentos, subvenciones ⊆ A ((Δ) × A (δ), y • Pref es un pedido anticipado en A (δ) × A (δ). El orden de preferencia permite distinguir diferentes tipos de relaciones entre los argumentos: Definición 2.5. Sea A1, A2 dos argumentos de A (δ).• Si A2 socava A1, A1 se defiende contra A2 IFF A1 pref A2. De lo contrario, A1 no se defiende.• Un conjunto de argumentos A defiende A1 IFF por cada A2 que socava A1, donde A1 no se defiende contra A2, entonces hay algunos A3 ∈ un tal que A3 socava A2 y A2 no se defiende contra A3. Escribimos AUNDERCUT, pref para denotar el conjunto de todos los argumentos y argumentos que no son inferiores defendiéndose contra todos sus argumentos socavados. El conjunto A (Δ) de argumentos aceptables del sistema de argumentación A (δ), subrayado, pref es [1] el punto de fijación menos de una función F: A ⊆ A (δ) F (A) = {(S, P)∈ A (δ) |(S, p) se defiende por una} definición 2.6. El conjunto de argumentos aceptables para un sistema de argumentación A (Δ), subvenciones, pref se define recursivamente como: a (Δ) = [fi≥0 (∅) = aundercut, pref ∪ h [fi≥1 (aundercut, pref) iUn argumento es aceptable si es un miembro del conjunto aceptable, y una proposición es aceptable si es la conclusión de un argumento aceptable. Un argumento aceptable es uno que, en cierto sentido, está probado ya que todos los argumentos que podrían socavarlo son socavados. Si hay un argumento aceptable para una Proposición P, entonces se acepta el estado de P, mientras que si no hay un argumento aceptable para P, el estado de P no se acepta. Se dice que el argumento A afecta el estado de otro argumento A si cambiar el estado de A cambiará el estado de a.3. Los sistemas de diálogos como los descritos en [2, 18], establecen conjuntos de locuciones que los agentes pueden hacer para presentar proposiciones y los argumentos que las respaldan, y protocolos que definen con precisión qué locuciones se pueden hacer en qué puntos del diálogo. No nos preocupa este nivel de detalle aquí. En cambio, estamos interesados en la interacción entre los argumentos que los agentes presentan. Como resultado, consideraremos solo que los agentes pueden presentar argumentos. No discutimos los detalles del mecanismo que se utiliza para presentar estos argumentos hacia adelante; solo suponemos que los argumentos de la forma (S, P) se insertan en una tienda de compromiso de agentes donde luego son visibles para otros agentes. Luego tenemos una definición típica de un diálogo: definición 3.1. Un diálogo D es una secuencia de movimientos: M1, M2 ,..., Mn. Un movimiento dado dado es un par α, AI, donde la IA es un argumento que α coloca en su almacén de compromiso CSα. Movimientos en un diálogo basado en la argumentación típicamente movimientos de ataque que se han realizado anteriormente. Si bien, en general, un diálogo puede incluir movimientos que socavan varios argumentos, en el resto de este documento, solo consideraremos diálogos que presentan movimientos que socavaron como máximo un argumento. Por ahora no colocamos restricciones adicionales en los movimientos que conforman un diálogo. Más tarde veremos cómo las diferentes restricciones a los movimientos conducen a diferentes tipos de diálogo. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 1007, la secuencia de argumentos presentados en el diálogo está determinada por los agentes que participan en el diálogo, pero generalmente no son completamente libres de elegir qué argumentos hacen. Como se indicó anteriormente, su elección generalmente está limitada por un protocolo. Si escribimos la secuencia de N Moves M1, M2 ,..., Mn como Mn, y denota la secuencia vacía como M0, entonces podemos definir un Profocol de la siguiente manera: Definición 3.2. Un protocolo P es una función en una secuencia de movimientos MI en un diálogo D que, para todos los i ≥ 0, identifica un conjunto de movimientos posibles Mi+1 de los cuales se puede dibujar el MI+11 En otras palabras, para nuestros propósitos aquí, en cada punto de un diálogo, un protocolo determina un conjunto de posibles movimientos que los agentes pueden hacer como parte del diálogo. Si un diálogo D siempre elige sus movimientos m del conjunto m identificado por el protocolo P, entonces se dice que D se ajusta a P. incluso si un diálogo se ajusta a un protocolo, es típicamente el caso que el agente que participa en el diálogo tiene queHaga una elección de movimiento: tiene que elegir cuál de los movimientos en M para hacer. Este ejercicio de elección es a lo que nos referimos como un uso de la retórica de los agentes (en su sentido retórico de influir en el pensamiento y la conducta de una audiencia). Algunos de nuestros resultados darán una idea de cuánto alcance tiene un agente para ejercer retórica bajo diferentes protocolos. A medida que los argumentos se colocan en tiendas de compromiso y, por lo tanto, se hacen públicos, los agentes pueden determinar las relaciones entre ellas. En general, después de varios movimientos en un diálogo, algunos argumentos socavarán otros. Denotaremos el conjunto de argumentos {A1, A2 ,..., Aj} afirmado después de que se mueva m1, m2 ,..., MJ de un diálogo para ser AJ: la relación de los argumentos en AJ puede describirse como un gráfico de argumentación, similar a los descritos en, por ejemplo, [3, 4, 9]: definición 3.3. Un gráfico de argumentación AG sobre un conjunto de argumentos A es un gráfico dirigido (v, e) de modo que cada vértice v, v ∈ V denota un argumento a ∈ A, cada argumento A se denota por un vértice V, y cada borde dirigido E e dirigido e∈ E de V a V denota que V socava v. Usaremos el gráfico de argumentos del término como sinónimo de gráfico de argumentación. Tenga en cuenta que no requerimos que el gráfico de argumentación esté conectado. En otras palabras, la noción de un gráfico de argumentación permite la representación de argumentos que no se relacionan, al socavar o estar subterráneos, a cualquier otro argumento (volveremos a este punto en breve). Adaptamos algunas nociones teóricas de gráficos estándar para describir varios aspectos del gráfico de argumentación. Si hay un borde E desde el vértice V hasta el vértice V, entonces se dice que V es el padre de V y V es el hijo de V. En una reversión de la noción habitual, definimos una raíz de un gráfico de argumentacióncomo sigue: Definición 3.4. Una raíz de un gráfico de argumentación Ag = (V, E) es un nodo v ∈ V que no tiene hijos. Por lo tanto, una raíz de un gráfico es un nodo al que se pueden conectar los bordes dirigidos, pero desde el cual no se conectan los bordes dirigidos a otros nodos. Por lo tanto, una raíz es un nodo que representa una nota de 1 que hablamos de una raíz en lugar de la raíz; como se define, un gráfico de argumentación no necesita ser un árbol.V V Figura 1: Un argumento de ejemplo del argumento argumento que está socavado, pero que en sí mismo no se subeña. Una hoja de un gráfico de argumentación Ag = (V, E) es un nodo v ∈ V que no tiene padres. Por lo tanto, una hoja en un gráfico de argumentación representa un argumento que socava otro argumento, pero no hace una reducción. Así, en la Figura 1, V es una raíz, y V es una hoja. La razón de la reversión de las nociones habituales de raíz y hoja es que, como veremos, consideraremos diálogos para construir gráficos de argumentación a partir de las raíces (en nuestro sentido) hasta las hojas. La reversión de la terminología significa que coincide con el proceso natural de la construcción de árboles. Dado que, como se describió anteriormente, los gráficos de argumentación no pueden conectarse (en el sentido habitual de la teoría de gráficos), es útil distinguir nodos que están conectados a otros nodos, en particular a la raíz del árbol. Decimos que el nodo V está conectado al nodo V si y solo si hay una ruta de V a V. Dado que los bordes representan relaciones socavadas, la noción de conexión entre los nodos captura la influencia que un argumento puede tener en otro: Proposición 3.1. Dado un gráfico de argumentación AG, si hay algún argumento A, denotado por el nodo V que afecta el estado de otro argumento A, denotado por V, entonces V está conectado a V. Dadas las definiciones 2.5 y 2.6, las únicas formas en que A puede afectar el estado de A es si A se ve socava A, o si A Untebra algún argumento A que socava A, o si A socava algunos que se mueve a algunos que socava A,etcétera. En todos estos casos, una secuencia de relaciones socavadas relaciona los dos argumentos, y si ambos están en un gráfico de argumentación, esto significa que están conectados. Dado que la noción de ruta ignora la dirección de los arcos dirigidos, los nodos V y V están conectados si el borde entre ellos funciona de V a V o viceversa. Dado que un solo socava A si el borde se ejecuta de V a V, no podemos inferir que A afectará el estado de A de la información sobre si están conectados o no. La razón por la que necesitamos el concepto del gráfico de argumentación es que las propiedades del gráfico de argumentación nos dicen algo sobre el conjunto de argumentos que representa el gráfico. Cuando ese conjunto de argumentos se construye a través de un diálogo, existe una relación entre la estructura del gráfico de argumentación y el protocolo que gobierna el diálogo. Es el alcance de la relación entre la estructura y el protocolo lo que es el tema principal de este documento. Para estudiar esta relación, necesitamos establecer una correspondencia entre un diálogo y un gráfico de argumentación. Dadas las definiciones que tenemos hasta ahora, esto es simple: definición 3.6. Un diálogo d, que consiste en una secuencia de movimientos Mn, y un gráfico de argumento ag = (v, e) corresponde entre sí si ∀m ∈ Mn, el argumento ai que 1008 el sexto intl. Conf.En los agentes autónomos y los sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) se avanzan en Move MI se representa exactamente por un nodo v ∈ V, y ∀v ∈ V, V representa exactamente un argumento AI que ha sido avanzado por un movimiento m ∈ Mn. Por lo tanto, un diálogo corresponde a un gráfico de argumentación si y solo si cada argumento realizado en el diálogo corresponde a un nodo en el gráfico, y cada nodo en el gráfico corresponde a un argumento realizado en el diálogo. Esta correspondencia uno a uno nos permite considerar que cada nodo V en el gráfico tiene un índice I, que es el índice del movimiento en el diálogo que presenta el argumento que representa ese nodo. Por lo tanto, podemos, por ejemplo, referirnos al tercer nodo en el gráfico de argumentación, lo que significa que el nodo que representa el argumento presentado en el tercer movimiento del diálogo.4. Relevancia La mayoría del trabajo en los diálogos se refiere a lo que podríamos llamar diálogos coherentes, es decir, los diálogos en los que los participantes están, como en el trabajo de Walton y Krabbe [27], se centran en resolver algunas dudas a través del diálogo2 para capturar esta coherencia, esParece que necesitamos una noción de relevancia para restringir las declaraciones hechas por los agentes. Aquí estudiamos tres nociones de relevancia: definición 4.1. Considere un diálogo D, que consiste en una secuencia de movimientos MI, con un gráfico de argumento correspondiente AG. Se dice que el movimiento Mi+1, i> 1, es relevante si uno o más de las siguientes agujerosas: R1 que fabrican MI+1 cambiará el estado del argumento denotado por el primer nodo de AG. R2 haciendo MI+1 agregará un nodo VI+1 que está conectado al primer nodo de AG. R3 que hace MI+1 agregará un nodo VI+1 que está conectado al último nodo que se agregará a AG. La relevancia R2 es la forma de relevancia definida por [3] en su estudio del razonamiento estratégico y táctico3. La relevancia R1 fue sugerida por la noción utilizada en [15], y aunque difiere un poco de lo sugerido allí, creemos que captura la esencia de su predecesor. Tenga en cuenta que solo definimos la relevancia para el segundo movimiento del diálogo en adelante porque se toma el primer movimiento para identificar el tema del diálogo, es decir, la pregunta central que el diálogo está destinado a responder y, por lo tanto, debe ser relevante para elDiálogo, no importa lo que sea. Al asumir esto, centramos nuestra atención en el mismo tipo de diálogos que [18]. Podemos pensar en la relevancia como hacer cumplir una forma de parsimonia en un diálogo: evita que los agentes hagan declaraciones que no tienen sobre el estado actual del diálogo. Esto promueve la eficiencia, en el sentido de limitar el número de movimientos en el diálogo y, como en [15], evita que los agentes revelen información que podrían mantener mejor ocultos. Otra forma de parsimonia es insistir en que los agentes no pueden presentar argumentos que se vean socavados por los argumentos que ya se han hecho durante el diálogo. Por lo tanto, distinguimos tales argumentos.2 Ver [11, 12] para ver ejemplos de diálogos donde este no es el caso.3 Consideramos tales subtipos de retórica de razonamiento. Considere un diálogo D, que consiste en una secuencia de movimientos MI, con un gráfico de argumento correspondiente AG. El movimiento Mi+1 y el argumento que presenta, ai+1, se dice que están previstas, si Ai+1 está socavado por algunos a ∈ Ai. Usamos el término preventivo porque si se presenta tal argumento, puede parecer que otro agente anticipó el argumento que se hizo, y ya lo hizo un argumento que lo dejaría inútil. En el resto de este documento, solo trataremos con protocolos que permiten movimientos relevantes, en cualquiera de los sentidos introducidos anteriormente, y no se les permite ser previstas. Llamamos a tales protocolos protocolos básicos y diálogos llevados a cabo bajo tales diálogos básicos de protocolos. El gráfico de argumentos de un diálogo básico está algo restringido. Considere un diálogo básico D. El gráfico de argumentación AG que corresponde a D es un árbol con una sola raíz. Recuerde que la definición 3.3 solo requiere que AG sea un gráfico dirigido. Para demostrar que es un árbol, tenemos que demostrar que es acíclico y conectado. Que el gráfico está conectado se deduce de la construcción del gráfico bajo un protocolo que hace cumplir la relevancia. Si la noción de relevancia es R3, cada movimiento agrega un nodo que está conectado al nodo anterior. Si la noción de relevancia es R2, cada movimiento agrega un nodo que está conectado a la raíz y, por lo tanto, está conectado a algún nodo en el gráfico. Si la noción de relevancia es R1, cada movimiento tiene que cambiar el estado del argumento denotado por la raíz. La Proposición 3.1 nos dice que para afectar el estado de un argumento A, el nodo V que representa el argumento A que está afectando el cambio debe estar conectado a V, el nodo que representa A, por lo que se deduce que cada nuevo nodo agregado como resultadode un movimiento R1relevant se conectará al gráfico de argumentación. Dado que un diálogo básico no permite movimientos que se prefieren, cada borde que se agrega durante la construcción se dirige desde el nodo que se agrega a uno que ya está en el gráfico (por lo tanto, denota que el argumento se denota por el nodo agregado, V, socava elargumento un denotado por el nodo al que se realiza la conexión, v, en lugar de al revés). Dado que cada borde que se agrega se dirige desde el nuevo nodo hasta el resto del gráfico, no puede haber ciclos. Para mostrar que AG tiene una sola raíz, considere su construcción desde el nodo inicial. Después de M1, el gráfico tiene un nodo, V1 que es tanto una raíz como una hoja. Después de M2, el gráfico es dos nodos conectados por un borde, y V1 ahora es una raíz y no una hoja.V2 es una hoja y no una raíz. Sin embargo, se agrega el tercer nodo, el argumento anterior en esta prueba demuestra que habrá un borde dirigido desde él a algún otro nodo, lo que lo convierte en una hoja. Por lo tanto, V1 siempre será la única raíz. La decisión de los movimientos preventados significa que V1 nunca dejará de ser una raíz, por lo que el gráfico de argumentación siempre tendrá una raíz. Dado que cada gráfico de argumentación construido por un diálogo básico es un árbol con una sola raíz, esto significa que el primer nodo de cada gráfico de argumentación es la raíz. Aunque estos resultados son sencillos de obtener, nos permiten mostrar cómo se relacionan las nociones de relevancia. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 1009 Proposición 4.2. Considere un diálogo básico d, que consiste en una secuencia de movimientos MI, con un gráfico de argumentos correspondiente AG.1. Cada movimiento Mi+1 que es relevante R1 es relevante de R2. Lo contrario no se mantiene.2. Cada movimiento Mi+1 que es relevante R3 es relevante de R2. Lo contrario no se mantiene.3. No todos los movimientos MI+1 que son R1 relevantes son R3 relevantes, y no todos los movimientos MI+1 que es R3 relevante es una prueba R1relevante. Para 1, considere cómo Mover Mi+1 puede satisfacer R1. La Proposición 3.1 nos dice que si Ai+1 puede cambiar el estado del argumento denotado por la raíz V1 (que, como se observó anteriormente, es el primer nodo) de Ag, entonces VI+1 debe estar conectado a la raíz. Esto es precisamente lo que se requiere para satisfacer R2, y se demuestra que la relación se mantiene. Para ver que lo contrario no se mantiene, tenemos que considerar lo que se necesita para cambiar el estado de R (ya que la Proposición 3.1 nos dice que la conexión no es suficiente para garantizar un cambio de estado: si lo hizo, R1 y R2 la relevancia coincidiría). Para que MI+1 cambie el estado de la raíz, tendrá que (1) hacer que el argumento sea representado por R inaceptable, si fuera aceptable antes del movimiento, o (2) aceptable si fuera inaceptable antes del movimiento. Dada la definición de aceptabilidad, puede lograr (1) desmentiendo directamente el argumento representado por R, en cuyo caso VI+1 estará conectado directamente a R por algún borde, o subfutando algún argumento A que es parte del conjuntode argumentos no subterráneos que defienden A. En el último caso, VI+1 se conectará directamente al nodo que representa A y por la Proposición 4.1 a R.Para lograr (2), VI+1 tendrá que socavar un argumento A que actualmente está socavando A, o está socavando un argumento que de otro modo defendería A. Ahora, considere además que MI+1 presenta un argumento AI+1 que socava el argumento denotado por algún nodo V, pero este último argumento se defiende contra AI+1. En tal caso, el conjunto de argumentos aceptables no cambiará, por lo que el estado de AR no cambiará. Por lo tanto, un movimiento que es relevante R2 no necesita ser relevante R1. Para 2, considere que MI+1 puede satisfacer R3 simplemente agregando un nodo que está conectado a VI, el último nodo que se agregará a Ag. Por la Proposición 4.1, está conectado a R y también es R2 relevante. Para ver que lo contrario no se mantiene, considere que un movimiento relevante de R2 puede conectarse a cualquier nodo en AG. La primera parte de 3 sigue por un argumento similar a que acabamos de usar: un movimiento relevante de R1 no tiene que conectarse a VI, solo a una V que es parte del gráfico, y la segunda parte sigue desde un movimiento que esR3-Relevant puede introducir un argumento AI+1 que socava el argumento que AI presenta el movimiento anterior (y así VI+1 está conectado a VI), pero encuentra que AI se defiende contra AI+1, evitando un cambio de estado enla raíz. Lo más interesante no es tanto los resultados, sino por qué se mantienen, ya que esto revela algunos aspectos de la interacción entre relevancia y la estructura de los gráficos de argumentos. Por ejemplo, para reafirmar un caso de la prueba de la Proposición 4.2, un movimiento que es relevante R3 por definición tiene que agregar un nodo al gráfico de argumentos que está conectado al último nodo que se agregó. Dado que un movimiento que es relevante R2 puede agregar un nodo que se conecta en cualquier lugar de un gráfico de argumentos, cualquier movimiento que sea relevante R3 será relevante R2, pero el Converse no se mantiene. Resulta que podemos explotar la interacción entre la estructura y la relevancia de que las proposiciones 4.1 y 4.2 han comenzado a iluminar para establecer relaciones entre los protocolos que rigen los diálogos y los gráficos de argumentos construidos durante dichos diálogos. Para hacer esto, necesitamos definir protocolos de tal manera que se refieran a la estructura del gráfico. Un protocolo es un rato único si todos los diálogos que se ajustan a él construyen gráficos de argumentos que tienen solo una rama. Un protocolo básico P es una ruta única si, para todos los i, el conjunto de movimientos permitidos en movimiento, soy todos r3relevant. La relevancia R3 requiere que cada nodo agregado al gráfico de argumentos esté conectado al nodo anterior. A partir del primer nodo, esto construye recursivamente un árbol con una sola rama, y la relación se mantiene. Lo contrario no se mantiene porque incluso si uno o más movimientos en el protocolo son relevantes para R1 o R2, puede ser el caso que, debido a una elección retórica de los agentes o debido a su conocimiento, cada argumento que se elige para ser puestoForward socavará el argumento anterior y, por lo tanto, el gráfico de argumentos es un árbol de una rama. Buscando tipos de protocolo más complejos que construyan tipos más complejos de gráfico de argumentos, es un movimiento obvio para recurrir a: Definición 4.4. Un protocolo básico es la ruta múltiple si todos los diálogos que se ajustan a él pueden construir gráficos de argumentos que son árboles. Pero, en la reflexión, ya que cualquier gráfico con una sola rama también es un árbol: la Proposición 4.4. Cualquier protocolo de una sola vía es una instancia de un protocolo de múltiples vías.y, además: Proposición 4.5. Cualquier protocolo básico P es múltiple. Inmediato de la Proposición 4.1, por lo que la noción de un protocolo múltiple no tiene mucha tracción. Como resultado, distinguimos protocolos de múltiples rutas que permiten diálogos que pueden construir árboles que tienen más de una rama como protocolos espantos. Luego tenemos: Proposición 4.6. Un protocolo básico P es tupido si, para algunos i, el conjunto de movimientos permitidos en movimiento, son todos relevantes de R1 o R2. De la Proposición 4.3 sabemos que si todos los movimientos son relevantes para R3, entonces obtenga un árbol con una rama, y de la Proposición 4.1 sabemos que todos los protocolos básicos construirán un gráfico de argumentos que es un árbol, por lo que siempre que excluyamos los movimientos relevantes de R3, obtendremos protocolos que pueden construir árboles múltiples.1010 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07), por supuesto, ya que, por la Propuesta 4.2, cualquier movimiento que sea R3Relevant es relevante de R2 y posiblemente puede ser relevante de R1 (todo esa Proposición 4.2 nos dice que no hay que no hayGarantizar que será), todo lo que nos dice la Proposición 4.6 es que los diálogos que se ajustan a los protocolos espantos pueden tener más de una rama. Todo lo que podemos hacer es identificar un límite en el número de ramas: Proposición 4.7. Considere un diálogo básico d que incluye m movimientos que no son relevantes para R3 y que tiene un gráfico de argumentación AG correspondiente. El número de ramas en AG es menor o igual a M + 1. Dado que debe conectar un nodo al último nodo agregado a AG, un movimiento relevante de R3 solo puede extender una rama existente. Dado que no tienen la misma restricción, los movimientos relevantes de R1 y R2 pueden crear una nueva rama conectándose a un nodo que no es el último nodo agregado. Cada movimiento podría crear una nueva rama, y si lo hacen, tendremos m ramas. Si hubo movimientos relevantes de R3 antes de cualquiera de estos movimientos de creación de rama nueva, entonces estas ramas M son además de la rama inicial creada por los movimientos relevantes de R3, y tenemos un máximo de ramas posibles M + 1. Distinguemos los protocolos espesos de los protocolos de múltiples rutas y, por lo tanto, la relevancia R1 y R2 de la relevancia R3, debido a los tipos de diálogo que hace cumplir la relevancia R3. En un diálogo en el que todos los movimientos deben ser relevantes para R3, el gráfico de argumentación tiene una sola rama: el diálogo consiste en una secuencia de argumentos, cada uno de los cuales socava el anterior y el último movimiento que se hace es el que resuelve el diálogo. Esto, como veremos a continuación, significa que dicho diálogo solo permite un subconjunto de todos los movimientos que de otro modo serían posibles.5. Completa La discusión anterior de la diferencia entre los diálogos llevados a cabo bajo protocolos de ruta única y tupida nos lleva a la consideración de lo que [18] llamó predeterminismo, pero ahora preferimos describir el uso del término integridad. La idea del predeterminismo, como se describe en [18], captura la noción de que, en algunas circunstancias, el resultado de un diálogo se puede establecer sin tener el diálogo: los agentes tienen suficiente espacio para la maniobra retórica que pudo verEl contenido de todos los σi de todos los αi ∈ A, uno podría identificar el resultado de cualquier diálogo sobre un tema determinado4. Desarrollamos esta idea considerando cómo los gráficos de argumentos construidos por los diálogos bajo diferentes protocolos se comparan con los diálogos completos. Comenzamos desarrollando ideas de lo que podría significar completo. Una definición razonable es que: Definición 5.1. Un diálogo básico d entre el conjunto de agentes A con un gráfico de argumentación correspondiente AG es el tema completo si ningún agente puede construir un argumento A que socava cualquier argumento A representado por un nodo en AG. El gráfico de argumentación construido por un diálogo completado del tema se denomina gráfico de argumentación de Tema Complete y se denota ag (d) t.4 Suponiendo que el σi no cambia durante el diálogo, que es la suposición habitual en este tipo de diálogo. Un diálogo es completar el tema cuando ningún agente puede agregar cualquier cosa que esté directamente conectada al tema del diálogo. Algunos protocolos evitarán que los agentes realicen movimientos a pesar de que el diálogo no es completado. Para distinguir tales casos tenemos: definición 5.2. Un diálogo básico d entre el conjunto de agentes a con un gráfico de argumentación correspondiente AG es el protocolo complete bajo un protocolo p si ningún agente puede hacer un movimiento que agrega un nodo al gráfico de argumentación que P. el gráfico de argumentación construido porUn diálogo Completo de Protocolo se llama gráfico de argumentación de protocolo y se denota ag (d) p. Cualquier diálogo D bajo un protocolo básico P es el protocolo completo si es complementario del tema. Lo contrario no se mantiene en general. Si D es el tema completo, ningún agente puede hacer un movimiento que extienda el gráfico de argumentación. Esto significa que ningún agente puede hacer un movimiento permitido por un protocolo básico, por lo que D también está completo. Lo contrario no se mantiene ya que algunos diálogos básicos (bajo un protocolo que solo permite movimientos relevantes de R3, por ejemplo) no permitirán ciertos movimientos (como la adición de un nodo que se conecta a la raíz del gráfico de argumentación después de más de dos movimientos) que se permitiría en un diálogo TopicComplete. Para un diálogo básico D, Ag (D) P es un sub-gráfico de Ag (d) t. Obviamente, a partir de la definición de un sub-gráfico, el Converso del Corolario 5.1 no se mantiene en general. La distinción importante entre el tema y el protocoleguez es que el primero está determinado puramente por el estado del diálogo, según lo capturado por el gráfico de argumentación, y por lo tanto es independiente del protocolo, mientras que el segundo está determinado completamente por el protocolo. Cada vez que un diálogo termina en un estado de completidad del protocolo en lugar de la integridad del tema, está terminando cuando los agentes aún tienen cosas que decir, pero no pueden porque el protocolo no les permitirá. Con estas definiciones de integridad, nuestra tarea es relacionar el completidad del tema, la propiedad que garantiza que los agentes puedan decir todo lo que tienen que decir en un diálogo que es, en cierto sentido, importante, a las nociones de relevancia que hemos desarrollado -que determinan qué se permite decir los agentes. Cuando necesitamos condiciones muy específicas para hacer que los diálogos de protocolo completen el tema completen, significa que los agentes tienen mucho espacio para maniouver retórico cuando esas condiciones no están en vigor. Es decir, hay muchas maneras en que pueden cerrar los diálogos antes de que se haya dicho todo lo que se puede decir. Cuando se requieren pocas condiciones, o las condiciones están ausentes, los diálogos entre agentes con el mismo conocimiento siempre se desarrollarán de la misma manera, y la retórica no tiene lugar. Un diálogo básico que completa con el protocolo d bajo un protocolo que solo permite movimientos relevantes de R3 será completado solo cuando Ag (D) T tiene una sola rama en la que los nodos están etiquetados en orden creciente desde la raíz. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 1011 Prueba. Dado lo que sabemos sobre la relevancia R3, la condición en Ag (D) P que tiene una sola rama es obvia. Esta no es una condición suficiente por sí sola porque ciertos protocolos pueden prevenir, a través de restricciones adicionales, como la toma de turnos estrictas en un diálogo multipartidista, todos los nodos en Ag (d) T, que no está sujeto a tales restricciones, siendoagregado al gráfico. Solo cuando AG (D) t incluye los nodos en el orden exacto en que se presentan los argumentos correspondientes es necesario que se construya un gráfico de argumentación de Tema Complete. Dada la Proposición 5.1, estas son las condiciones bajo las cuales los diálogos realizados bajo la noción de relevancia R3 siempre serán predeterminadas, y dado lo restrictivos que son las condiciones, tales diálogos parecen tener mucho espacio para que la retórica desempeñe un papel. Para encontrar condiciones similares para los diálogos compuestos de movimientos relevantes R1and R2, primero debemos distinguir entre ellos. Podemos hacer esto en términos de la estructura del gráfico de argumentación: Proposición 5.3. Considere un diálogo básico d, con argumento Graph AG que tiene Root R denotando un argumento A. Si el argumento A, denotado por el nodo V es un movimiento R2relevant M, M no es relevante R1 si y solo si: 1. Hay dos nodos V y V en la ruta entre V y R, y el argumento denotado por V defiendeen sí mismo contra el argumento denotado por V;o 2. Hay un argumento A, denotado por el nodo V, que afecta el estado de A, y la ruta de V a R tiene uno o más nodos en común con la ruta de V a R.Prueba. Para la primera condición, considere que dado que AG es un árbol, V está conectado a r.Por lo tanto, hay una serie de relaciones socavadas entre A y A, y esto se corrige a un camino a través de AG. Si esta ruta es la única rama en el árbol, A afectará el estado de A a menos que la cadena de afecto se rompa con un interruptor que no puede cambiar el estado del argumento de interrupción porque este último se defiende. Para la segunda condición, como para la primera, la única forma en que A no puede afectar el estado de A es si algo está bloqueando su influencia. Si esto no se debe a la defensa, debe deberse a que hay algún nodo U en la ruta que representa un argumento cuyo estado se fija de alguna manera, y eso debe significar que hay otra cadena de relaciones con socavado, otra rama del árbol,Eso es incidente en ti. Dado que esta segunda rama denota otra cadena de argumentos, y estos afectan el estado del argumento denotado por U, también deben afectar el estado de A. Cualquiera de estos es la A en la condición. Entonces, un movimiento relevante de R2 M no es relevante para R1 si su efecto está bloqueado porque un argumento aguas arriba no es lo suficientemente fuerte o porque hay otra línea de argumento que actualmente está determinando el estado del argumento en la raíz. Esto, a su vez, significa que si el efecto no se debe a la defensa, entonces hay un movimiento alternativo que es relevante R1, un movimiento que socava A en la segunda condición superior5. Ahora podemos mostrar 5, aunque el agente en cuestión puede hacer tal movimiento es otra pregunta. Un diálogo básico de protocolo D siempre será el tema completo bajo un protocolo que solo incluye movimientos relevantes de R2 y permite que se realicen cada movimiento relevante de R2. La restricción de las reglas relevantes de R2 es exactamente eso para el complemento de temas, por lo que un diálogo que solo tiene movimientos relevantes de R2 continuará hasta que se haya presentado cada argumento que cualquier agente que pueda hacer. Dado esto, y lo que revelamos sobre la relevancia R1 en la Proposición 5.3, podemos ver que: Proposición 5.5. Un diálogo básico de protocolo complemento d bajo un protocolo que solo incluye movimientos relevantes de R1 será el tema completo si ag (d) t: 1. incluye ninguna ruta con nodos adyacentes v, que denotan A y V, que denotan A, de modo que A, de modo queUn socavación A y A es más fuerte que A;y 2. es tal que los nodos en cada rama tienen índices consecutivos y ningún nodo con un grado mayor de dos es un número impar de arcos de un nodo de hoja. La primera condición descarta la primera condición en la Proposición 5.3, y la segunda trata de la situación que conduce a la segunda condición en la Proposición 5.3. La segunda condición asegura que cada rama se construya en su totalidad antes de agregar cualquier nueva rama, y cuando se agrega una nueva rama, el argumento que se ve subrayado como parte de la adición será aceptable, por lo que la adición cambiará el estado delargumento denotado por ese nodo, y de ahí la raíz. Con estas condiciones, se permitirá cada movimiento requerido para construir AG (d) T y, por lo tanto, el diálogo será completado cuando se haya completado cada movimiento. La segunda parte de este resultado solo identifica una forma posible de garantizar que se cumpla la segunda condición en la Propuesta 5.3, por lo que la conversación de este resultado no se mantiene. Sin embargo, lo que tenemos es suficiente para responder la pregunta sobre la predeterminación con la que comenzamos. Para que los diálogos sean predeterminados, se deben realizar cada movimiento que sea relevante R2. En tales casos, cada diálogo es un tema completo. Si no requerimos que se realicen todos los movimientos relevantes de R2, entonces hay algo de espacio para la retórica, la forma en que se presentan las líneas de argumento alternativas se convierte en un problema. Si los movimientos se ven obligados a ser relevantes para R3, entonces hay un espacio considerable para el juego retórico.6. Resumen Este documento ha estudiado las diferentes ideas de relevancia en el diálogo basado en la argumentación, identificando la relación entre estas ideas y mostrando cómo pueden afectar en qué medida la forma en que los agentes eligen se mueven en un diálogo: lo que algunos autores han llamado la estrategiay tácticas de un diálogo. Esto extiende el trabajo existente sobre la relación, como [3, 15] al mostrar cómo diferentes nociones de relevancia pueden tener un efecto en el resultado de un diálogo, en particular cuando hacen que el resultado sea predeterminado. Esta conexión extiende el trabajo de [18] que consideró el resultado del diálogo, pero no se detuvo en la identificación de las condiciones bajo las cuales está predeterminada. Hay dos formas en que actualmente estamos tratando de extender este trabajo, los cuales generalizarán los resultados y extenderán su aplicabilidad. Primero, queremos relajar las restricciones que 1012 el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) hemos impuesto, la exclusión de los movimientos que atacan varios argumentos (sin los cuales el gráfico de argumentos puede estar conectado de manera mulitiva) y la exclusión de los movimientos preventivos, sin los cuales el argumento gráficopuede tener ciclos. En segundo lugar, queremos extender las ideas de relevancia para hacer frente a los movimientos que no solo agregan argumentos socavados, sino que también respaldan argumentos, teniendo en cuenta así los marcos de argumentación bipolar [5]. Agradecimientos Los autores agradecen el apoyo financiero recibido de la CE, a través del Proyecto IST-FP6-002307, y de la NSF bajo las subvenciones REC-19347 y NSF IIS-0329037. También agradecen a Peter Stone por una pregunta, ahora varios años, que este artículo finalmente ha respondido.7. Referencias [1] L. Amgoud y C. Cayrol.

        "An agent α maintains a knowledge base, Σα, containing formulas of a propositional language L and having no deductive closure.",
        "Agent α also maintains the set of its past utterances, called the commitment store, CSα.",
        "We refer to this as an agents public knowledge, since it contains information that is shared with other agents.",
        "In contrast, the contents of Σα are private to α.",
        "Note that in the description that follows, we assume that is the classical inference relation, that ≡ stands for logical equivalence, and we use Δ to denote all the information available to an agent.",
        "Thus in a dialogue between two agents α and β, Δα = Σα ∪ CSα ∪ CSβ, so the commitment store CSα can be loosely thought of as a subset of Δα consisting of the assertions that have been made public.",
        "In some dialogue games, such as those in [18] anything in CSα is either in Σα or can be derived from it.",
        "In other dialogue games, such as 1006 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS those in [2], CSα may contain things that cannot be derived from Σα.",
        "Definition 2.1.",
        "An argument A is a pair (S, p) where p is a formula of L and S a subset of Δ such that (i) S is consistent; (ii) S p; and (iii) S is minimal, so no proper subset of S satisfying both (1) and (2) exists.",
        "S is called the support of A, written S = Support(A) and p is the conclusion of A, written p = Conclusion(A).",
        "Thus we talk of p being supported by the argument (S, p).",
        "In general, since Δ may be inconsistent, arguments in A(Δ), the set of all arguments which can be made from Δ, may conflict, and we make this idea precise with the notion of undercutting: Definition 2.2.",
        "Let A1 and A2 be arguments in A(Δ).",
        "A1 undercuts A2 iff ∃¬p ∈ Support(A2) such that p ≡ Conclusion(A1).",
        "In other words, an argument is undercut if and only if there is another argument which has as its conclusion the negation of an element of the support for the first argument.",
        "To capture the fact that some beliefs are more strongly held than others, we assume that any set of beliefs has a preference order over it.",
        "We consider all information available to an agent, Δ, to be stratified into non-overlapping subsets Δ1, . . . , Δn such that beliefs in Δi are all equally preferred and are preferred over elements in Δj where i > j.",
        "The preference level of a nonempty subset S ⊂ Δ, where different elements s ∈ S may belong to different layers Δi, is valued at the highest numbered layer which has a member in S and is referred to as level(S).",
        "In other words, S is only as strong as its weakest member.",

        "We can now define the argumentation system we will use: Definition 2.4.",
        "An argumentation system is a triple: A(Δ), Undercut, Pref such that: • A(Δ) is a set of the arguments built from Δ, • Undercut is a binary relation representing the defeat relationship between arguments, Undercut ⊆ A(Δ) × A(Δ), and • Pref is a pre-ordering on A(Δ) × A(Δ).",
        "The preference order makes it possible to distinguish different types of relations between arguments: Definition 2.5.",

        "If there is an acceptable argument for a proposition p, then the status of p is accepted, while if there is not an acceptable argument for p, the status of p is not accepted.",
        "Argument A is said to affect the status of another argument A if changing the status of A will change the status of A . 3.",
        "DIALOGUES Systems like those described in [2, 18], lay down sets of locutions that agents can make to put forward propositions and the arguments that support them, and protocols that define precisely which locutions can be made at which points in the dialogue.",
        "We are not concerned with such a level of detail here.",
        "Instead we are interested in the interplay between arguments that agents put forth.",
        "As a result, we will consider only that agents are allowed to put forward arguments.",
        "We do not discuss the detail of the mechanism that is used to put these arguments forward - we just assume that arguments of the form (S, p) are inserted into an agents commitment store where they are then visible to other agents.",
        "We then have a typical definition of a dialogue: Definition 3.1.",
        "A dialogue D is a sequence of moves: m1, m2, . . . , mn.",
        "A given move mi is a pair α, Ai where Ai is an argument that α places into its commitment store CSα.",
        "Moves in an argumentation-based dialogue typically attack moves that have been made previously.",
        "While, in general, a dialogue can include moves that undercut several arguments, in the remainder of this paper, we will only consider dialogues that put forward moves that undercut at most one argument.",
        "For now we place no additional constraints on the moves that make up a dialogue.",
        "Later we will see how different restrictions on moves lead to different kinds of dialogue.",
        "The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1007 The sequence of arguments put forward in the dialogue is determined by the agents who are taking part in the dialogue, but they are usually not completely free to choose what arguments they make.",
        "As indicated earlier, their choice is typically limited by a protocol.",
        "If we write the sequence of n moves m1, m2, . . . , mn as mn, and denote the empty sequence as m0, then we can define a profocol in the following way: Definition 3.2.",
        "A protocol P is a function on a sequence of moves mi in a dialogue D that, for all i ≥ 0, identifies a set of possible moves Mi+1 from which the mi+1th move may be drawn: P : mi → Mi+1 In other words, for our purposes here, at every point in a dialogue, a protocol determines a set of possible moves that agents may make as part of the dialogue.",
        "If a dialogue D always picks its moves m from the set M identified by protocol P, then D is said to conform to P. Even if a dialogue conforms to a protocol, it is typically the case that the agent engaging in the dialogue has to make a choice of move - it has to choose which of the moves in M to make.",
        "This excercise of choice is what we refer to as an agents use of rhetoric (in its oratorical sense of influencing the thought and conduct of an audience).",
        "Some of our results will give a sense of how much scope an agent has to exercise rhetoric under different protocols.",
        "As arguments are placed into commitment stores, and hence become public, agents can determine the relationships between them.",
        "In general, after several moves in a dialogue, some arguments will undercut others.",
        "We will denote the set of arguments {A1, A2, . . . , Aj} asserted after moves m1, m2, . . . , mj of a dialogue to be Aj - the relationship of the arguments in Aj can be described as an argumentation graph, similar to those described in, for example, [3, 4, 9]: Definition 3.3.",
        "An argumentation graph AG over a set of arguments A is a directed graph (V, E) such that every vertex v, v ∈ V denotes one argument A ∈ A, every argument A is denoted by one vertex v, and every directed edge e ∈ E from v to v denotes that v undercuts v .",
        "We will use the term argument graph as a synonym for argumentation graph.",
        "Note that we do not require that the argumentation graph is connected.",
        "In other words the notion of an argumentation graph allows for the representation of arguments that do not relate, by undercutting or being undercut, to any other arguments (we will come back to this point very shortly).",
        "We adapt some standard graph theoretic notions in order to describe various aspects of the argumentation graph.",
        "If there is an edge e from vertex v to vertex v , then v is said to be the parent of v and v is said to be the child of v. In a reversal of the usual notion, we define a root of an argumentation graph1 as follows: Definition 3.4.",
        "A root of an argumentation graph AG = (V, E) is a node v ∈ V that has no children.",
        "Thus a root of a graph is a node to which directed edges may be connected, but from which no directed edges connect to other nodes.",

        "Similarly: Definition 3.5.",
        "A leaf of an argumentation graph AG = (V, E) is a node v ∈ V that has no parents.",
        "Thus a leaf in an argumentation graph represents an argument that undercuts another argument, but does no undercutting.",
        "Thus in Figure 1, v is a root, and v is a leaf.",
        "The reason for the reversal of the usual notions of root and leaf is that, as we shall see, we will consider dialogues to construct argumentation graphs from the roots (in our sense) to the leaves.",
        "The reversal of the terminology means that it matches the natural process of tree construction.",
        "Since, as described above, argumentation graphs are allowed to be not connected (in the usual graph theory sense), it is helpful to distinguish nodes that are connected to other nodes, in particular to the root of the tree.",
        "We say that node v is connected to node v if and only if there is a path from v to v .",
        "Since edges represent undercut relations, the notion of connectedness between nodes captures the influence that one argument may have on another: Proposition 3.1.",
        "Given an argumentation graph AG, if there is any argument A, denoted by node v that affects the status of another argument A , denoted by v , then v is connected to v .",
        "The converse does not hold.",
        "Proof.",
        "Given Definitions 2.5 and 2.6, the only ways in which A can affect the status of A is if A either undercuts A , or if A undercuts some argument A that undercuts A , or if A undercuts some A that undercuts some A that undercuts A , and so on.",
        "In all such cases, a sequence of undercut relations relates the two arguments, and if they are both in an argumentation graph, this means that they are connected.",
        "Since the notion of path ignores the direction of the directed arcs, nodes v and v are connected whether the edge between them runs from v to v or vice versa.",
        "Since A only undercuts A if the edge runs from v to v , we cannot infer that A will affect the status of A from information about whether or not they are connected.",
        "The reason that we need the concept of the argumentation graph is that the properties of the argumentation graph tell us something about the set of arguments A the graph represents.",
        "When that set of arguments is constructed through a dialogue, there is a relationship between the structure of the argumentation graph and the protocol that governs the dialogue.",
        "It is the extent of the relationship between structure and protocol that is the main subject of this paper.",
        "To study this relationship, we need to establish a correspondence between a dialogue and an argumentation graph.",
        "Given the definitions we have so far, this is simple: Definition 3.6.",
        "A dialogue D, consisting of a sequence of moves mn, and an argument graph AG = (V, E) correspond to one another iff ∀m ∈ mn, the argument Ai that 1008 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) is advanced at move mi is represented by exactly one node v ∈ V , and ∀v ∈ V , v represents exactly one argument Ai that has been advanced by a move m ∈ mn.",
        "Thus a dialogue corresponds to an argumentation graph if and only if every argument made in the dialogue corresponds to a node in the graph, and every node in the graph corresponds to an argument made in the dialogue.",
        "This one-toone correspondence allows us to consider each node v in the graph to have an index i which is the index of the move in the dialogue that put forward the argument which that node represents.",
        "Thus we can, for example, refer to the third node in the argumentation graph, meaning the node that represents the argument put forward in the third move of the dialogue. 4.",
        "RELEVANCE Most work on dialogues is concerned with what we might call coherent dialogues, that is dialogues in which the participants are, as in the work of Walton and Krabbe [27], focused on resolving some question through the dialogue2 To capture this coherence, it seems we need a notion of relevance to constrain the statements made by agents.",
        "Here we study three notions of relevance: Definition 4.1.",
        "Consider a dialogue D, consisting of a sequence of moves mi, with a corresponding argument graph AG.",
        "The move mi+1, i > 1, is said to be relevant if one or more of the following hold: R1 Making mi+1 will change the status of the argument denoted by the first node of AG.",
        "R2 Making mi+1 will add a node vi+1 that is connected to the first node of AG.",
        "R3 Making mi+1 will add a node vi+1 that is connected to the last node to be added to AG.",
        "R2-relevance is the form of relevance defined by [3] in their study of strategic and tactical reasoning3 .",
        "R1-relevance was suggested by the notion used in [15], and though it differs somewhat from that suggested there, we believe it captures the essence of its predecessor.",
        "Note that we only define relevance for the second move of the dialogue onwards because the first move is taken to identify the subject of the dialogue, that is, the central question that the dialogue is intended to answer, and hence it must be relevant to the dialogue, no matter what it is.",
        "In assuming this, we focus our attention on the same kind of dialogues as [18].",
        "We can think of relevance as enforcing a form of parsimony on a dialogue - it prevents agents from making statements that do not bear on the current state of the dialogue.",
        "This promotes efficiency, in the sense of limiting the number of moves in the dialogue, and, as in [15], prevents agents revealing information that they might better keep hidden.",
        "Another form of parsimony is to insist that agents are not allowed to put forward arguments that will be undercut by arguments that have already been made during the dialogue.",
        "We therefore distinguish such arguments. 2 See [11, 12] for examples of dialogues where this is not the case. 3 We consider such reasoning sub-types of rhetoric.",

        "Consider a dialogue D, consisting of a sequence of moves mi, with a corresponding argument graph AG.",
        "The move mi+1 and the argument it puts forward, Ai+1, are both said to be pre-empted, if Ai+1 is undercut by some A ∈ Ai.",
        "We use the term pre-empted because if such an argument is put forward, it can seem as though another agent anticipated the argument being made, and already made an argument that would render it useless.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we will only deal with protocols that permit moves that are relevant, in any of the senses introduced above, and are not allowed to be pre-empted.",
        "We call such protocols basic protocols, and dialogues carried out under such protocols basic dialogues.",
        "The argument graph of a basic dialogue is somewhat restricted.",
        "Proposition 4.1.",
        "Consider a basic dialogue D. The argumentation graph AG that corresponds to D is a tree with a single root.",
        "Proof.",
        "Recall that Definition 3.3 requires only that AG be a directed graph.",
        "To show that it is a tree, we have to show that it is acyclic and connected.",
        "That the graph is connected follows from the construction of the graph under a protocol that enforces relevance.",
        "If the notion of relevance is R3, each move adds a node that is connected to the previous node.",
        "If the notion of relevance is R2, then every move adds a node that is connected to the root, and thus is connected to some node in the graph.",
        "If the notion of relevance is R1, then every move has to change the status of the argument denoted by the root.",
        "Proposition 3.1 tells us that to affect the status of an argument A , the node v representing the argument A that is effecting the change has to be connected to v , the node representing A , and so it follows that every new node added as a result of an R1relevant move will be connected to the argumentation graph.",
        "Thus AG is connected.",
        "Since a basic dialogue does not allow moves that are preempted, every edge that is added during construction is directed from the node that is added to one already in the graph (thus denoting that the argument A denoted by the added node, v, undercuts the argument A denoted by the node to which the connection is made, v , rather than the other way around).",
        "Since every edge that is added is directed from the new node to the rest of the graph, there can be no cycles.",
        "Thus AG is a tree.",
        "To show that AG has a single root, consider its construction from the initial node.",
        "After m1 the graph has one node, v1 that is both a root and a leaf.",
        "After m2, the graph is two nodes connected by an edge, and v1 is now a root and not a leaf. v2 is a leaf and not a root.",
        "However the third node is added, the argument earlier in this proof demonstrates that there will be a directed edge from it to some other node, making it a leaf.",
        "Thus v1 will always be the only root.",
        "The ruling out of pre-empted moves means that v1 will never cease to be a root, and so the argumentation graph will always have one root.",
        "Since every argumentation graph constructed by a basic dialogue is a tree with a single root, this means that the first node of every argumentation graph is the root.",

        "Proposition 3.1 tells us that if Ai+1 can change the status of the argument denoted by the root v1 (which, as observed above, is the first node) of AG, then vi+1 must be connected to the root.",
        "This is precisely what is required to satisfy R2, and the relatiosnhip is proved to hold.",
        "To see that the converse does not hold, we have to consider what it takes to change the status of r (since Proposition 3.1 tells us that connectedness is not enough to ensure a change of status - if it did, R1 and R2 relevance would coincide).",
        "For mi+1 to change the status of the root, it will have to (1) make the argument A represented by r either unacceptable, if it were acceptable before the move, or (2) acceptable if it were unacceptable before the move.",
        "Given the definition of acceptability, it can achieve (1) either by directly undercutting the argument represented by r, in which case vi+1 will be directly connected to r by some edge, or by undercutting some argument A that is part of the set of non-undercut arguments defending A.",
        "In the latter case, vi+1 will be directly connected to the node representing A and by Proposition 4.1 to r. To achieve (2), vi+1 will have to undercut an argument A that is either currently undercutting A, or is undercutting an argument that would otherwise defend A.",
        "Now, further consider that mi+1 puts forward an argument Ai+1 that undercuts the argument denoted by some node v , but this latter argument defends itself against Ai+1.",
        "In such a case, the set of acceptable arguments will not change, and so the status of Ar will not change.",
        "Thus a move that is R2-relevant need not be R1-relevant.",
        "For 2, consider that mi+1 can satisfy R3 simply by adding a node that is connected to vi, the last node to be added to AG.",
        "By Proposition 4.1, it is connected to r and so is R2-relevant.",
        "To see that the converse does not hold, consider that an R2-relevant move can connect to any node in AG.",
        "The first part of 3 follows by a similar argument to that we just used - an R1-relevant move does not have to connect to vi, just to some v that is part of the graph - and the second part follows since a move that is R3-relevant may introduce an argument Ai+1 that undercuts the argument Ai put forward by the previous move (and so vi+1 is connected to vi), but finds that Ai defends itself against Ai+1, preventing a change of status at the root.",
        "What is most interesting is not so much the results but why they hold, since this reveals some aspects of the interplay between relevance and the structure of argument graphs.",
        "For example, to restate a case from the proof of Proposition 4.2, a move that is R3-relevant by definition has to add a node to the argument graph that is connected to the last node that was added.",
        "Since a move that is R2-relevant can add a node that connects anywhere on an argument graph, any move that is R3-relevant will be R2-relevant, but the converse does not hold.",
        "It turns out that we can exploit the interplay between structure and relevance that Propositions 4.1 and 4.2 have started to illuminate to establish relationships between the protocols that govern dialogues and the argument graphs constructed during such dialogues.",
        "To do this we need to define protocols in such a way that they refer to the structure of the graph.",

        "R3-relevance requires that every node added to the argument graph be connected to the previous node.",
        "Starting from the first node this recursively constructs a tree with just one branch, and the relationship holds.",
        "The converse does not hold because even if one or more moves in the protocol are R1- or R2-relevant, it may be the case that, because of an agents rhetorical choice or because of its knowledge, every argument that is chosen to be put forward will undercut the previous argument and so the argument graph is a one-branch tree.",

        "From Proposition 4.3 we know that if all moves are R3-relevant then well get a tree with one branch, and from Proposition 4.1 we know that all basic protocols will build an argument graph that is a tree, so providing we exclude R3-relevant moves, we will get protocols that can build multi-branch trees. 1010 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Of course, since, by Proposition 4.2, any move that is R3relevant is R2-relevant and can quite possibly be R1-relevant (all that Proposition 4.2 tells us is that there is no guarantee that it will be), all that Proposition 4.6 tells us is that dialogues that conform to bushy protocols may have more than one branch.",

        "COMPLETENESS The above discussion of the difference between dialogues carried out under single-path and bushy protocols brings us to the consideration of what [18] called predeterminism, but we now prefer to describe using the term completeness.",
        "The idea of predeterminism, as described in [18], captures the notion that, under some circumstances, the result of a dialogue can be established without actually having the dialogue - the agents have sufficiently little room for rhetorical manoeuver that were one able to see the contents of all the Σi of all the αi ∈ A, one would be able to identify the outcome of any dialogue on a given subject4 .",
        "We develop this idea by considering how the argument graphs constructed by dialogues under different protocols compare to benchmark complete dialogues.",
        "We start by developing ideas of what complete might mean.",
        "One reasonable definition is that: Definition 5.1.",
        "A basic dialogue D between the set of agents A with a corresponding argumentation graph AG is topic-complete if no agent can construct an argument A that undercuts any argument A represented by a node in AG.",
        "The argumentation graph constructed by a topic-complete dialogue is called a topic-complete argumentation graph and is denoted AG(D)T . 4 Assuming that the Σi do not change during the dialogue, which is the usual assumption in this kind of dialogue.",
        "A dialogue is topic-complete when no agent can add anything that is directly connected to the subject of the dialogue.",
        "Some protocols will prevent agents from making moves even though the dialogue is not topic-complete.",
        "To distinguish such cases we have: Definition 5.2.",
        "A basic dialogue D between the set of agents A with a corresponding argumentation graph AG is protocol-complete under a protocol P if no agent can make a move that adds a node to the argumentation graph that is permitted by P. The argumentation graph constructed by a protocol-complete dialogue is called a protocol-complete argumentation graph and is denoted AG(D)P .",
        "Clearly: Proposition 5.1.",
        "Any dialogue D under a basic protocol P is protocol-complete if it is topic-complete.",
        "The converse does not hold in general.",
        "Proof.",
        "If D is topic-complete, no agent can make a move that will extend the argumentation graph.",
        "This means that no agent can make a move that is permitted by a basic protocol, and so D is also protocol complete.",
        "The converse does not hold since some basic dialogues (under a protocol that only permits R3-relevant moves, for example) will not permit certain moves (like the addition of a node that connects to the root of the argumentation graph after more than two moves) that would be allowed in a topiccomplete dialogue.",
        "Corollary 5.1.",
        "For a basic dialogue D, AG(D)P is a sub-graph of AG(D)T .",
        "Obviously, from the definition of a sub-graph, the converse of Corollary 5.1 does not hold in general.",
        "The important distinction between topic- and protocolcompleteness is that the former is determined purely by the state of the dialogue - as captured by the argumentation graph - and is thus independent of the protocol, while the latter is determined entirely by the protocol.",
        "Any time that a dialogue ends in a state of protocol-completeness rather than topic completeness, it is ending when agents still have things to say but cant because the protocol wont allow them to.",
        "With these definitions of completeness, our task is to relate topic-completeness - the property that ensures that agents can say everything that they have to say in a dialogue that is, in some sense, important - to the notions of relevance we have developed - which determine what agents are allowed to say.",
        "When we need very specific conditions to make protocol-complete dialogues topic-complete, it means that agents have lots of room for rhetorical maneouver when those conditions are not in force.",
        "That is there are many ways they can bring dialogues to a close before everything that can be said has been said.",
        "Where few conditions are required, or conditions are absent, then dialogues between agents with the same knowledge will always play out the same way, and rhetoric has no place.",
        "We have: Proposition 5.2.",
        "A protocol-complete basic dialogue D under a protocol which only allows R3-relevant moves will be topic-complete only when AG(D)T has a single branch in which the nodes are labelled in increasing order from the root.",
        "The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1011 Proof.",
        "Given what we know about R3-relevance, the condition on AG(D)P having a single branch is obvious.",
        "This is not a sufficient condition on its own because certain protocols may prevent - through additional restrictions, like strict turn-taking in a multi-party dialogue - all the nodes in AG(D)T , which is not subject to such restrictions, being added to the graph.",
        "Only when AG(D)T includes the nodes in the exact order that the corresponding arguments are put forward is it necessary that a topic-complete argumentation graph be constructed.",
        "Given Proposition 5.1, these are the conditions under which dialogues conducted under the notion of R3-relevance will always be predetermined, and given how restrictive the conditions are, such dialogues seem to have plenty of room for rhetoric to play a part.",
        "To find similar conditions for dialogues composed of R1and R2-relevant moves, we first need to distinguish between them.",
        "We can do this in terms of the structure of the argumentation graph: Proposition 5.3.",
        "Consider a basic dialogue D, with argumentation graph AG which has root r denoting an argument A.",
        "If argument A , denoted by node v is an an R2relevant move m, m is not R1-relevant if and only if: 1. there are two nodes v and v on the path between v and r, and the argument denoted by v defends itself against the argument denoted by v ; or 2. there is an argument A , denoted by node v , that affects the status of A, and the path from v to r has one or more nodes in common with the path from v to r. Proof.",
        "For the first condition, consider that since AG is a tree, v is connected to r. Thus there is a series of undercut relations between A and A , and this corrresponds to a path through AG.",
        "If this path is the only branch in the tree, then A will affect the status of A unless the chain of affect is broken by an undercut that cant change the status of the undercut argument because the latter defends itself.",
        "For the second condition, as for the first, the only way that A cannot affect the status of A is if something is blocking its influence.",
        "If this is not due to defending against, it must be because there is some node u on the path that represents an argument whose status is fixed somehow, and that must mean that there is another chain of undercut relations, another branch of the tree, that is incident at u.",
        "Since this second branch denotes another chain of arguments, and these affect the status of the argument denoted by u, they must also affect the status of A.",
        "Any of these are the A in the condition.",
        "So an R2-relevant move m is not R1-relevant if either its effect is blocked because an argument upstream is not strong enough, or because there is another line of argument that is currently determining the status of the argument at the root.",
        "This, in turn, means that if the effect is not due to defending against, then there is an alternative move that is R1-relevant - a move that undercuts A in the second condition above5 .",
        "We can now show 5 Though whether the agent in question can make such a move is another question.",
        "Proposition 5.4.",
        "A protocol-complete basic dialogue D will always be topic-complete under a protocol which only includes R2-relevant moves and allows every R2-relevant move to be made.",
        "The restriction on R2-relevant rules is exactly that for topiccompleteness, so a dialogue that has only R2-relevant moves will continue until every argument that any agent can make has been put forward.",
        "Given this, and what we revealed about R1-relevance in Proposition 5.3, we can see that: Proposition 5.5.",
        "A protocol-complete basic dialogue D under a protocol which only includes R1-relevant moves will be topic-complete if AG(D)T : 1. includes no path with adjacent nodes v, denoting A, and v , denoting A , such that A undercuts A and A is stronger that A; and 2. is such that the nodes in every branch have consecutive indices and no node with degree greater than two is an odd number of arcs from a leaf node.",
        "Proof.",
        "The first condition rules out the first condition in Proposition 5.3, and the second deals with the situation that leads to the second condition in Proposition 5.3.",
        "The second condition ensures that each branch is constructed in full before any new branch is added, and when a new branch is added, the argument that is undercut as part of the addition will be acceptable, and so the addition will change the status of the argument denoted by that node, and hence the root.",
        "With these conditions, every move required to construct AG(D)T will be permitted and so the dialogue will be topic-complete when every move has been completed.",
        "The second part of this result only identifies one possible way to ensure that the second condition in Proposition 5.3 is met, so the converse of this result does not hold.",
        "However, what we have is sufficient to answer the question about predetermination that we started with.",
        "For dialogues to be predetermined, every move that is R2-relevant must be made.",
        "In such cases every dialogue is topic complete.",
        "If we do not require that all R2-relevant moves are made, then there is some room for rhetoric - the way in which alternative lines of argument are presented becomes an issue.",
        "If moves are forced to be R3-relevant, then there is considerable room for rhetorical play. 6.",
        "SUMMARY This paper has studied the different ideas of relevance in argumentation-based dialogue, identifying the relationship between these ideas, and showing how they can impact the extent to which the way that agents choose moves in a dialogue - what some authors have called the strategy and tactics of a dialogue.",
        "This extends existing work on relvance, such as [3, 15] by showing how different notions of relevance can have an effect on the outcome of a dialogue, in particular when they render the outcome predetermined.",
        "This connection extends the work of [18] which considered dialogue outcome, but stopped short of identifying the conditions under which it is predetermined.",
        "There are two ways we are currently trying to extend this work, both of which will generalise the results and extend its applicability.",
        "First, we want to relax the restrictions that 1012 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) we have imposed, the exclusion of moves that attack several arguments (without which the argument graph can be mulitply-connected) and the exclusion of pre-empted moves, without which the argument graph can have cycles.",
        "Second, we want to extend the ideas of relevance to cope with moves that do not only add undercutting arguments, but also supporting arguments, thus taking account of bipolar argumentation frameworks [5].",

                "Early examples of argumentation-based approaches to multiagent agreement include the work of Dignum et al. [7], Kraus [14], Parsons and Jennings [16], Reed [23], Schroeder et al. [25] and Sycara [26].",
                "The work of Walton and Krabbe [27], popularised in the multiagent systems community by Reed [23], has been particularly influential in the field of argumentation-based dialogue.",
                "This work influenced the field in a number of ways, perhaps most deeply in framing multi-agent interactions as dialogue games in the tradition of Hamblin [13].",
                "Viewing dialogues in this way, as in [2, 21], provides a powerful framework for analysing the formal properties of dialogues, and for identifying suitable protocols under which dialogues can be conducted [18, 20].",
                "The dialogue game view overlaps with work on conversation policies (see, for example, [6, 10]), but differs in considering the entire dialogue rather than dialogue segments.",

                "<br>relevance</br> is a topic of increasing interest in argumentation-based dialogue because it relates to the scope that an agent has for applying strategic manoeuvering to obtain the outcomes that it requires [19, 22, 24].",
                "Our work identifes the limits on such rhetorical manoeuvering, showing when it can and cannot have an effect. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND We begin by introducing the formal system of argumentation that underpins our approach, as well as the corresponding terminology and notation, all taken from [2, 8, 17].",
                "A dialogue is a sequence of messages passed between two or more members of a set of agents A.",
                "An agent α maintains a knowledge base, Σα, containing formulas of a propositional language L and having no deductive closure.",
                "Agent α also maintains the set of its past utterances, called the commitment store, CSα.",
                "We refer to this as an agents public knowledge, since it contains information that is shared with other agents.",
                "In contrast, the contents of Σα are private to α.",
                "Note that in the description that follows, we assume that is the classical inference relation, that ≡ stands for logical equivalence, and we use Δ to denote all the information available to an agent.",
                "Thus in a dialogue between two agents α and β, Δα = Σα ∪ CSα ∪ CSβ, so the commitment store CSα can be loosely thought of as a subset of Δα consisting of the assertions that have been made public.",
                "In some dialogue games, such as those in [18] anything in CSα is either in Σα or can be derived from it.",
                "In other dialogue games, such as 1006 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS those in [2], CSα may contain things that cannot be derived from Σα.",

                "In general, since Δ may be inconsistent, arguments in A(Δ), the set of all arguments which can be made from Δ, may conflict, and we make this idea precise with the notion of undercutting: Definition 2.2.",

                "If there were R3-relevant moves before any of these new-branch-creating moves, then these m branches are in addition to the initial branch created by the R3-relevant moves, and we have a maximum of m + 1 possible branches.",
                "We distinguish bushy protocols from multi-path protocols, and hence R1- and R2-<br>relevance</br> from R3-<br>relevance</br>, because of the kinds of dialogue that R3-relevance enforces.",
                "In a dialogue in which all moves must be R3-relevant, the argumentation graph has a single branch - the dialogue consists of a sequence of arguments each of which undercuts the previous one and the last move to be made is the one that settles the dialogue.",
                "This, as we will see next, means that such a dialogue only allows a subset of all the moves that would otherwise be possible. 5.",
                "COMPLETENESS The above discussion of the difference between dialogues carried out under single-path and bushy protocols brings us to the consideration of what [18] called predeterminism, but we now prefer to describe using the term completeness.",
                "The idea of predeterminism, as described in [18], captures the notion that, under some circumstances, the result of a dialogue can be established without actually having the dialogue - the agents have sufficiently little room for rhetorical manoeuver that were one able to see the contents of all the Σi of all the αi ∈ A, one would be able to identify the outcome of any dialogue on a given subject4 .",
                "We develop this idea by considering how the argument graphs constructed by dialogues under different protocols compare to benchmark complete dialogues.",
                "We start by developing ideas of what complete might mean.",
                "One reasonable definition is that: Definition 5.1.",

                "A dialogue is topic-complete when no agent can add anything that is directly connected to the subject of the dialogue.",
                "Some protocols will prevent agents from making moves even though the dialogue is not topic-complete.",
                "To distinguish such cases we have: Definition 5.2.",
                "A basic dialogue D between the set of agents A with a corresponding argumentation graph AG is protocol-complete under a protocol P if no agent can make a move that adds a node to the argumentation graph that is permitted by P.

                "Any dialogue D under a basic protocol P is protocol-complete if it is topic-complete.",
                "The converse does not hold in general.",
                "Proof.",
                "If D is topic-complete, no agent can make a move that will extend the argumentation graph.",
                "This means that no agent can make a move that is permitted by a basic protocol, and so D is also protocol complete.",
                "The converse does not hold since some basic dialogues (under a protocol that only permits R3-relevant moves, for example) will not permit certain moves (like the addition of a node that connects to the root of the argumentation graph after more than two moves) that would be allowed in a topiccomplete dialogue.",
                "Corollary 5.1.",
                "For a basic dialogue D, AG(D)P is a sub-graph of AG(D)T .",
                "Obviously, from the definition of a sub-graph, the converse of Corollary 5.1 does not hold in general.",
                "The important distinction between topic- and protocolcompleteness is that the former is determined purely by the state of the dialogue - as captured by the argumentation graph - and is thus independent of the protocol, while the latter is determined entirely by the protocol.",
                "Any time that a dialogue ends in a state of protocol-completeness rather than topic completeness, it is ending when agents still have things to say but cant because the protocol wont allow them to.",
                "With these definitions of completeness, our task is to relate topic-completeness - the property that ensures that agents can say everything that they have to say in a dialogue that is, in some sense, important - to the notions of <br>relevance</br> we have developed - which determine what agents are allowed to say.",
                "When we need very specific conditions to make protocol-complete dialogues topic-complete, it means that agents have lots of room for rhetorical maneouver when those conditions are not in force.",
                "That is there are many ways they can bring dialogues to a close before everything that can be said has been said.",
                "Where few conditions are required, or conditions are absent, then dialogues between agents with the same knowledge will always play out the same way, and rhetoric has no place.",
                "We have: Proposition 5.2.",
                "A protocol-complete basic dialogue D under a protocol which only allows R3-relevant moves will be topic-complete only when AG(D)T has a single branch in which the nodes are labelled in increasing order from the root.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1011 Proof.",
                "Given what we know about R3-<br>relevance</br>, the condition on AG(D)P having a single branch is obvious.",
                "This is not a sufficient condition on its own because certain protocols may prevent - through additional restrictions, like strict turn-taking in a multi-party dialogue - all the nodes in AG(D)T , which is not subject to such restrictions, being added to the graph.",
                "Only when AG(D)T includes the nodes in the exact order that the corresponding arguments are put forward is it necessary that a topic-complete argumentation graph be constructed.",
                "Given Proposition 5.1, these are the conditions under which dialogues conducted under the notion of R3-<br>relevance</br> will always be predetermined, and given how restrictive the conditions are, such dialogues seem to have plenty of room for rhetoric to play a part.",
                "To find similar conditions for dialogues composed of R1and R2-relevant moves, we first need to distinguish between them.",
                "We can do this in terms of the structure of the argumentation graph: Proposition 5.3.",

                "If argument A , denoted by node v is an an R2relevant move m, m is not R1-relevant if and only if: 1. there are two nodes v and v on the path between v and r, and the argument denoted by v defends itself against the argument denoted by v ; or 2. there is an argument A , denoted by node v , that affects the status of A, and the path from v to r has one or more nodes in common with the path from v to r. Proof.",
                "For the first condition, consider that since AG is a tree, v is connected to r. Thus there is a series of undercut relations between A and A , and this corrresponds to a path through AG.",
                "If this path is the only branch in the tree, then A will affect the status of A unless the chain of affect is broken by an undercut that cant change the status of the undercut argument because the latter defends itself.",
                "For the second condition, as for the first, the only way that A cannot affect the status of A is if something is blocking its influence.",
                "If this is not due to defending against, it must be because there is some node u on the path that represents an argument whose status is fixed somehow, and that must mean that there is another chain of undercut relations, another branch of the tree, that is incident at u.",
                "Since this second branch denotes another chain of arguments, and these affect the status of the argument denoted by u, they must also affect the status of A.",
                "Any of these are the A in the condition.",
                "So an R2-relevant move m is not R1-relevant if either its effect is blocked because an argument upstream is not strong enough, or because there is another line of argument that is currently determining the status of the argument at the root.",
                "This, in turn, means that if the effect is not due to defending against, then there is an alternative move that is R1-relevant - a move that undercuts A in the second condition above5 .",
                "We can now show 5 Though whether the agent in question can make such a move is another question.",

                "The restriction on R2-relevant rules is exactly that for topiccompleteness, so a dialogue that has only R2-relevant moves will continue until every argument that any agent can make has been put forward.",
                "Given this, and what we revealed about R1-<br>relevance</br> in Proposition 5.3, we can see that: Proposition 5.5.",
                "A protocol-complete basic dialogue D under a protocol which only includes R1-relevant moves will be topic-complete if AG(D)T : 1. includes no path with adjacent nodes v, denoting A, and v , denoting A , such that A undercuts A and A is stronger that A; and 2. is such that the nodes in every branch have consecutive indices and no node with degree greater than two is an odd number of arcs from a leaf node.",
                "Proof.",
                "The first condition rules out the first condition in Proposition 5.3, and the second deals with the situation that leads to the second condition in Proposition 5.3.",
                "The second condition ensures that each branch is constructed in full before any new branch is added, and when a new branch is added, the argument that is undercut as part of the addition will be acceptable, and so the addition will change the status of the argument denoted by that node, and hence the root.",
                "With these conditions, every move required to construct AG(D)T will be permitted and so the dialogue will be topic-complete when every move has been completed.",
                "The second part of this result only identifies one possible way to ensure that the second condition in Proposition 5.3 is met, so the converse of this result does not hold.",
                "However, what we have is sufficient to answer the question about predetermination that we started with.",
                "For dialogues to be predetermined, every move that is R2-relevant must be made.",
                "In such cases every dialogue is topic complete.",
                "If we do not require that all R2-relevant moves are made, then there is some room for rhetoric - the way in which alternative lines of argument are presented becomes an issue.",
                "If moves are forced to be R3-relevant, then there is considerable room for rhetorical play. 6.",
                "SUMMARY This paper has studied the different ideas of <br>relevance</br> in argumentation-based dialogue, identifying the relationship between these ideas, and showing how they can impact the extent to which the way that agents choose moves in a dialogue - what some authors have called the strategy and tactics of a dialogue.",
                "This extends existing work on relvance, such as [3, 15] by showing how different notions of <br>relevance</br> can have an effect on the outcome of a dialogue, in particular when they render the outcome predetermined.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) we have imposed, the exclusion of moves that attack several arguments (without which the argument graph can be mulitply-connected) and the exclusion of pre-empted moves, without which the argument graph can have cycles.",
                "Second, we want to extend the ideas of <br>relevance</br> to cope with moves that do not only add undercutting arguments, but also supporting arguments, thus taking account of bipolar argumentation frameworks [5].",

                "Early examples of argumentation-based approaches to multiagent agreement include the work of Dignum et al. [7], Kraus [14], Parsons and Jennings [16], Reed [23], Schroeder et al. [25] and Sycara [26].",
                "The work of Walton and Krabbe [27], popularised in the multiagent systems community by Reed [23], has been particularly influential in the field of argumentation-based dialogue.",
                "This work influenced the field in a number of ways, perhaps most deeply in framing multi-agent interactions as dialogue games in the tradition of Hamblin [13].",
                "Viewing dialogues in this way, as in [2, 21], provides a powerful framework for analysing the formal properties of dialogues, and for identifying suitable protocols under which dialogues can be conducted [18, 20].",
                "The dialogue game view overlaps with work on conversation policies (see, for example, [6, 10]), but differs in considering the entire dialogue rather than dialogue segments.",

                "Relevance is a topic of increasing interest in argumentation-based dialogue because it relates to the scope that an agent has for applying strategic manoeuvering to obtain the outcomes that it requires [19, 22, 24].",

                "An agent α maintains a knowledge base, Σα, containing formulas of a propositional language L and having no deductive closure.",
                "Agent α also maintains the set of its past utterances, called the commitment store, CSα.",
                "We refer to this as an agents public knowledge, since it contains information that is shared with other agents.",
                "In contrast, the contents of Σα are private to α.",
                "Note that in the description that follows, we assume that is the classical inference relation, that ≡ stands for logical equivalence, and we use Δ to denote all the information available to an agent.",
                "Thus in a dialogue between two agents α and β, Δα = Σα ∪ CSα ∪ CSβ, so the commitment store CSα can be loosely thought of as a subset of Δα consisting of the assertions that have been made public.",
                "In some dialogue games, such as those in [18] anything in CSα is either in Σα or can be derived from it.",
                "In other dialogue games, such as 1006 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS those in [2], CSα may contain things that cannot be derived from Σα.",

                "If we write the sequence of n moves m1, m2, . . . , mn as mn, and denote the empty sequence as m0, then we can define a profocol in the following way: Definition 3.2.",

                "If a dialogue D always picks its moves m from the set M identified by protocol P, then D is said to conform to P. Even if a dialogue conforms to a protocol, it is typically the case that the agent engaging in the dialogue has to make a choice of move - it has to choose which of the moves in M to make.",

                "Since, as described above, argumentation graphs are allowed to be not connected (in the usual <br>graph</br> theory sense), it is helpful to distinguish nodes that are connected to other nodes, in particular to the root of the tree.",

                "The converse does not hold.",
                "Proof.",
                "Given Definitions 2.5 and 2.6, the only ways in which A can affect the status of A is if A either undercuts A , or if A undercuts some argument A that undercuts A , or if A undercuts some A that undercuts some A that undercuts A , and so on.",
                "In all such cases, a sequence of undercut relations relates the two arguments, and if they are both in an argumentation <br>graph</br>, this means that they are connected.",
                "Since the notion of path ignores the direction of the directed arcs, nodes v and v are connected whether the edge between them runs from v to v or vice versa.",
                "Since A only undercuts A if the edge runs from v to v , we cannot infer that A will affect the status of A from information about whether or not they are connected.",
                "The reason that we need the concept of the argumentation <br>graph</br> is that the properties of the argumentation <br>graph</br> tell us something about the set of arguments A the graph represents.",
                "When that set of arguments is constructed through a dialogue, there is a relationship between the structure of the argumentation <br>graph</br> and the protocol that governs the dialogue.",
                "It is the extent of the relationship between structure and protocol that is the main subject of this paper.",
                "To study this relationship, we need to establish a correspondence between a dialogue and an argumentation <br>graph</br>.",

                "Thus a dialogue corresponds to an argumentation <br>graph</br> if and only if every argument made in the dialogue corresponds to a node in the <br>graph</br>, and every node in the graph corresponds to an argument made in the dialogue.",
                "This one-toone correspondence allows us to consider each node v in the <br>graph</br> to have an index i which is the index of the move in the dialogue that put forward the argument which that node represents.",

                "Note that we only define relevance for the second move of the dialogue onwards because the first move is taken to identify the subject of the dialogue, that is, the central question that the dialogue is intended to answer, and hence it must be relevant to the dialogue, no matter what it is.",

                "Early examples of argumentation-based approaches to multiagent agreement include the work of Dignum et al. [7], Kraus [14], Parsons and Jennings [16], Reed [23], Schroeder et al. [25] and Sycara [26].",
                "The work of Walton and Krabbe [27], popularised in the multiagent systems community by Reed [23], has been particularly influential in the field of argumentation-based dialogue.",
                "This work influenced the field in a number of ways, perhaps most deeply in framing multi-agent interactions as dialogue games in the tradition of Hamblin [13].",
                "Viewing dialogues in this way, as in [2, 21], provides a powerful framework for analysing the formal properties of dialogues, and for identifying suitable protocols under which dialogues can be conducted [18, 20].",

                "Relevance is a topic of increasing interest in argumentation-based dialogue because it relates to the scope that an agent has for applying strategic manoeuvering to obtain the outcomes that it requires [19, 22, 24].",
                "Our work identifes the limits on such rhetorical manoeuvering, showing when it can and cannot have an effect. 2.",

                "A dialogue is a sequence of messages passed between two or more members of a set of agents A.",
                "An agent α maintains a knowledge base, Σα, containing formulas of a propositional language L and having no deductive closure.",
                "Agent α also maintains the set of its past utterances, called the commitment store, CSα.",
                "We refer to this as an agents public knowledge, since it contains information that is shared with other agents.",
                "In contrast, the contents of Σα are private to α.",
                "Note that in the description that follows, we assume that is the classical inference relation, that ≡ stands for logical equivalence, and we use Δ to denote all the information available to an agent.",
                "Thus in a dialogue between two agents α and β, Δα = Σα ∪ CSα ∪ CSβ, so the commitment store CSα can be loosely thought of as a subset of Δα consisting of the assertions that have been made public.",
                "In some dialogue games, such as those in [18] anything in CSα is either in Σα or can be derived from it.",
                "In other dialogue games, such as 1006 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS those in [2], CSα may contain things that cannot be derived from Σα.",

                "S is called the support of A, written S = Support(A) and p is the conclusion of A, written p = Conclusion(A).",

                "In general, since Δ may be inconsistent, arguments in A(Δ), the set of all arguments which can be made from Δ, may conflict, and we make this idea precise with the notion of undercutting: Definition 2.2.",

                "If a dialogue D always picks its moves m from the set M identified by protocol P, then D is said to conform to P. Even if a dialogue conforms to a protocol, it is typically the case that the agent engaging in the dialogue has to make a choice of move - it has to choose which of the moves in M to make.",

                "Given what we know about R3-relevance, the condition on AG(D)P having a single branch is obvious.",
                "This is not a sufficient condition on its own because certain protocols may prevent - through additional restrictions, like strict turn-taking in a multi-party dialogue - all the nodes in AG(D)T , which is not subject to such restrictions, being added to the graph.",
                "Only when AG(D)T includes the nodes in the exact order that the corresponding arguments are put forward is it necessary that a topic-complete argumentation graph be constructed.",
                "Given Proposition 5.1, these are the conditions under which dialogues conducted under the notion of R3-relevance will always be predetermined, and given how restrictive the conditions are, such dialogues seem to have plenty of room for rhetoric to play a part.",
                "To find similar conditions for dialogues composed of R1and R2-relevant moves, we first need to distinguish between them.",
                "We can do this in terms of the structure of the argumentation graph: Proposition 5.3.",

                "If argument A , denoted by <br>node</br> v is an an R2relevant move m, m is not R1-relevant if and only if: 1. there are two nodes v and v on the path between v and r, and the argument denoted by v defends itself against the argument denoted by v ; or 2. there is an argument A , denoted by <br>node</br> v , that affects the status of A, and the path from v to r has one or more nodes in common with the path from v to r. Proof.",
                "For the first condition, consider that since AG is a tree, v is connected to r. Thus there is a series of undercut relations between A and A , and this corrresponds to a path through AG.",
                "If this path is the only branch in the tree, then A will affect the status of A unless the chain of affect is broken by an undercut that cant change the status of the undercut argument because the latter defends itself.",
                "For the second condition, as for the first, the only way that A cannot affect the status of A is if something is blocking its influence.",
                "If this is not due to defending against, it must be because there is some <br>node</br> u on the path that represents an argument whose status is fixed somehow, and that must mean that there is another chain of undercut relations, another branch of the tree, that is incident at u.",
                "Since this second branch denotes another chain of arguments, and these affect the status of the argument denoted by u, they must also affect the status of A.",
                "Any of these are the A in the condition.",
                "So an R2-relevant move m is not R1-relevant if either its effect is blocked because an argument upstream is not strong enough, or because there is another line of argument that is currently determining the status of the argument at the root.",
                "This, in turn, means that if the effect is not due to defending against, then there is an alternative move that is R1-relevant - a move that undercuts A in the second condition above5 .",

                "Given this, and what we revealed about R1-relevance in Proposition 5.3, we can see that: Proposition 5.5.",
                "A protocol-complete basic dialogue D under a protocol which only includes R1-relevant moves will be topic-complete if AG(D)T : 1. includes no path with adjacent nodes v, denoting A, and v , denoting A , such that A undercuts A and A is stronger that A; and 2. is such that the nodes in every branch have consecutive indices and no <br>node</br> with degree greater than two is an odd number of arcs from a leaf <br>node</br>.",

                "The second condition ensures that each branch is constructed in full before any new branch is added, and when a new branch is added, the argument that is undercut as part of the addition will be acceptable, and so the addition will change the status of the argument denoted by that <br>node</br>, and hence the root.",
                "With these conditions, every move required to construct AG(D)T will be permitted and so the dialogue will be topic-complete when every move has been completed.",
                "The second part of this result only identifies one possible way to ensure that the second condition in Proposition 5.3 is met, so the converse of this result does not hold.",
                "However, what we have is sufficient to answer the question about predetermination that we started with.",

                "SUMMARY This paper has studied the different ideas of relevance in argumentation-based dialogue, identifying the relationship between these ideas, and showing how they can impact the extent to which the way that agents choose moves in a dialogue - what some authors have called the strategy and tactics of a dialogue.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) we have imposed, the exclusion of moves that attack several arguments (without which the argument graph can be mulitply-connected) and the exclusion of pre-empted moves, without which the argument graph can have cycles.",
                "Second, we want to extend the ideas of relevance to cope with moves that do not only add undercutting arguments, but also supporting arguments, thus taking account of bipolar argumentation frameworks [5].",

                "Early examples of argumentation-based approaches to multiagent agreement include the work of Dignum et al. [7], Kraus [14], Parsons and Jennings [16], Reed [23], Schroeder et al. [25] and Sycara [26].",
                "The work of Walton and Krabbe [27], popularised in the multiagent systems community by Reed [23], has been particularly influential in the field of argumentation-based dialogue.",

                "Thus in a dialogue between two agents α and β, Δα = Σα ∪ CSα ∪ CSβ, so the commitment store CSα can be loosely thought of as a subset of Δα consisting of the assertions that have been made public.",
                "In some dialogue games, such as those in [18] anything in CSα is either in Σα or can be derived from it.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Of course, since, by Proposition 4.2, any move that is R3relevant is R2-relevant and can quite possibly be R1-relevant (all that Proposition 4.2 tells us is that there is no guarantee that it will be), all that Proposition 4.6 tells us is that dialogues that conform to bushy protocols may have more than one branch.",

                "Proof.",
                "Since it must connect a node to the last node added to AG, an R3-relevant move can only extend an existing branch.",
                "Since they do not have the same restriction, R1 and R2-relevant moves may create a new branch by connecting to a node that is not the last node added.",
                "Every such move could create a new branch, and if they do, we will have m branches.",
                "If there were R3-relevant moves before any of these new-branch-creating moves, then these m branches are in addition to the initial branch created by the R3-relevant moves, and we have a maximum of m + 1 possible branches.",
                "We distinguish bushy protocols from multi-path protocols, and hence R1- and R2-relevance from R3-relevance, because of the kinds of dialogue that R3-relevance enforces.",
                "In a dialogue in which all moves must be R3-relevant, the argumentation graph has a single branch - the dialogue consists of a sequence of arguments each of which undercuts the previous one and the last move to be made is the one that settles the dialogue.",
                "This, as we will see next, means that such a dialogue only allows a subset of all the moves that would otherwise be possible. 5.",
                "COMPLETENESS The above discussion of the difference between dialogues carried out under single-path and bushy protocols brings us to the consideration of what [18] called predeterminism, but we now prefer to describe using the term completeness.",
                "The idea of predeterminism, as described in [18], captures the notion that, under some circumstances, the result of a dialogue can be established without actually having the dialogue - the agents have sufficiently little room for rhetorical manoeuver that were one able to see the contents of all the Σi of all the αi ∈ A, one would be able to identify the outcome of any dialogue on a given subject4 .",
                "We develop this idea by considering how the argument graphs constructed by dialogues under different protocols compare to benchmark complete dialogues.",

                "If D is topic-complete, no agent can make a move that will extend the argumentation graph.",
                "This means that no agent can make a move that is permitted by a basic protocol, and so D is also protocol complete.",
                "The converse does not hold since some basic dialogues (under a protocol that only permits R3-relevant moves, for example) will not permit certain moves (like the addition of a node that connects to the root of the argumentation graph after more than two moves) that would be allowed in a topiccomplete dialogue.",
                "Corollary 5.1.",
                "For a basic dialogue D, AG(D)P is a sub-graph of AG(D)T .",

                "The important distinction between topic- and protocolcompleteness is that the former is determined purely by the state of the dialogue - as captured by the argumentation graph - and is thus independent of the protocol, while the latter is determined entirely by the protocol.",
                "Any time that a dialogue ends in a state of protocol-completeness rather than topic completeness, it is ending when agents still have things to say but cant because the protocol wont allow them to.",
                "With these definitions of completeness, our task is to relate topic-completeness - the property that ensures that agents can say everything that they have to say in a dialogue that is, in some sense, important - to the notions of relevance we have developed - which determine what agents are allowed to say.",
                "When we need very specific conditions to make protocol-complete dialogues topic-complete, it means that agents have lots of room for rhetorical maneouver when those conditions are not in force.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1011 Proof.",
                "Given what we know about R3-relevance, the condition on AG(D)P having a single branch is obvious.",
                "This is not a sufficient condition on its own because certain protocols may prevent - through additional restrictions, like strict turn-taking in a multi-party dialogue - all the nodes in AG(D)T , which is not subject to such restrictions, being added to the graph.",
                "Only when AG(D)T includes the nodes in the exact order that the corresponding arguments are put forward is it necessary that a topic-complete argumentation graph be constructed.",
                "Given Proposition 5.1, these are the conditions under which dialogues conducted under the notion of R3-relevance will always be predetermined, and given how restrictive the conditions are, such dialogues seem to have plenty of room for rhetoric to play a part.",
                "To find similar conditions for dialogues composed of R1and R2-relevant moves, we first need to distinguish between them.",
                "We can do this in terms of the structure of the argumentation graph: Proposition 5.3.",

                "If argument A , denoted by node v is an an R2relevant move m, m is not R1-relevant if and only if: 1. there are two nodes v and v on the path between v and r, and the argument denoted by v defends itself against the argument denoted by v ; or 2. there is an argument A , denoted by node v , that affects the status of A, and the path from v to r has one or more nodes in common with the path from v to r. Proof.",
                "For the first condition, consider that since AG is a <br>tree</br>, v is connected to r. Thus there is a series of undercut relations between A and A , and this corrresponds to a path through AG.",
                "If this path is the only branch in the <br>tree</br>, then A will affect the status of A unless the chain of affect is broken by an undercut that cant change the status of the undercut argument because the latter defends itself.",
                "For the second condition, as for the first, the only way that A cannot affect the status of A is if something is blocking its influence.",
                "If this is not due to defending against, it must be because there is some node u on the path that represents an argument whose status is fixed somehow, and that must mean that there is another chain of undercut relations, another branch of the <br>tree</br>, that is incident at u.",
                "Since this second branch denotes another chain of arguments, and these affect the status of the argument denoted by u, they must also affect the status of A.",
                "Any of these are the A in the condition.",
                "So an R2-relevant move m is not R1-relevant if either its effect is blocked because an argument upstream is not strong enough, or because there is another line of argument that is currently determining the status of the argument at the root.",
                "This, in turn, means that if the effect is not due to defending against, then there is an alternative move that is R1-relevant - a move that undercuts A in the second condition above5 .",

                "Given this, and what we revealed about R1-relevance in Proposition 5.3, we can see that: Proposition 5.5.",
                "A protocol-complete basic dialogue D under a protocol which only includes R1-relevant moves will be topic-complete if AG(D)T : 1. includes no path with adjacent nodes v, denoting A, and v , denoting A , such that A undercuts A and A is stronger that A; and 2. is such that the nodes in every branch have consecutive indices and no node with degree greater than two is an odd number of arcs from a leaf node.",
                "Proof.",
                "The first condition rules out the first condition in Proposition 5.3, and the second deals with the situation that leads to the second condition in Proposition 5.3.",
                "The second condition ensures that each branch is constructed in full before any new branch is added, and when a new branch is added, the argument that is undercut as part of the addition will be acceptable, and so the addition will change the status of the argument denoted by that node, and hence the root.",
                "With these conditions, every move required to construct AG(D)T will be permitted and so the dialogue will be topic-complete when every move has been completed.",
                "The second part of this result only identifies one possible way to ensure that the second condition in Proposition 5.3 is met, so the converse of this result does not hold.",
                "However, what we have is sufficient to answer the question about predetermination that we started with.",

                "SUMMARY This paper has studied the different ideas of relevance in argumentation-based dialogue, identifying the relationship between these ideas, and showing how they can impact the extent to which the way that agents choose moves in a dialogue - what some authors have called the strategy and tactics of a dialogue.",

                "Recently, there has been increasing interest in the mechanisms agents might use to choose how to act - the rhetorical manoeuvring that they use to navigate through the space defined by the rules of the dialogue.",
                "Key in such considerations is the idea of relevance, since a usual requirement is that agents stay focussed on the subject of the dialogue and only make relevant remarks.",

                "INTRODUCTION Finding ways for agents to reach agreements in multiagent systems is an area of active research.",
                "One mechanism for achieving agreement is through the use of argumentation - where one agent tries to convince another agent of something during the course of some dialogue.",
                "Early examples of argumentation-based approaches to multiagent agreement include the work of Dignum et al. [7], Kraus [14], Parsons and Jennings [16], Reed [23], Schroeder et al. [25] and Sycara [26].",
                "The work of Walton and Krabbe [27], popularised in the multiagent systems community by Reed [23], has been particularly influential in the field of argumentation-based dialogue.",
                "This work influenced the field in a number of ways, perhaps most deeply in framing multi-agent interactions as dialogue games in the tradition of Hamblin [13].",
                "Viewing dialogues in this way, as in [2, 21], provides a powerful framework for analysing the formal properties of dialogues, and for identifying suitable protocols under which dialogues can be conducted [18, 20].",
                "The dialogue game view overlaps with work on conversation policies (see, for example, [6, 10]), but differs in considering the entire dialogue rather than dialogue segments.",
                "In this paper, we extend the work of [18] by considering the role of relevance - the relationship between utterances in a dialogue.",
                "Relevance is a topic of increasing interest in argumentation-based dialogue because it relates to the scope that an agent has for applying strategic manoeuvering to obtain the outcomes that it requires [19, 22, 24].",
                "Our work identifes the limits on such rhetorical manoeuvering, showing when it can and cannot have an effect. 2.",

                "A dialogue is a sequence of messages passed between two or more members of a set of agents A.",
                "An agent α maintains a knowledge base, Σα, containing formulas of a propositional language L and having no deductive closure.",
                "Agent α also maintains the set of its past utterances, called the commitment store, CSα.",
                "We refer to this as an agents public knowledge, since it contains information that is shared with other agents.",
                "In contrast, the contents of Σα are private to α.",
                "Note that in the description that follows, we assume that is the classical inference relation, that ≡ stands for logical equivalence, and we use Δ to denote all the information available to an agent.",
                "Thus in a dialogue between two agents α and β, Δα = Σα ∪ CSα ∪ CSβ, so the commitment store CSα can be loosely thought of as a subset of Δα consisting of the assertions that have been made public.",
                "In some dialogue games, such as those in [18] anything in CSα is either in Σα or can be derived from it.",
                "In other dialogue games, such as 1006 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS those in [2], CSα may contain things that cannot be derived from Σα.",

                "S is called the support of A, written S = Support(A) and p is the conclusion of A, written p = Conclusion(A).",

                "In general, since Δ may be inconsistent, arguments in A(Δ), the set of all arguments which can be made from Δ, may conflict, and we make this idea precise with the notion of undercutting: Definition 2.2.",

                "If we write the sequence of n moves m1, m2, . . . , mn as mn, and denote the empty sequence as m0, then we can define a profocol in the following way: Definition 3.2.",

                "If a dialogue D always picks its moves m from the set M identified by protocol P, then D is said to conform to P. Even if a dialogue conforms to a protocol, it is typically the case that the agent engaging in the dialogue has to make a choice of move - it has to choose which of the moves in M to make.",

                "The converse does not hold.",
                "Proof.",
                "Given Definitions 2.5 and 2.6, the only ways in which A can affect the <br>status</br> of A is if A either undercuts A , or if A undercuts some argument A that undercuts A , or if A undercuts some A that undercuts some A that undercuts A , and so on.",
                "In all such cases, a sequence of undercut relations relates the two arguments, and if they are both in an argumentation graph, this means that they are connected.",
                "Since the notion of path ignores the direction of the directed arcs, nodes v and v are connected whether the edge between them runs from v to v or vice versa.",
                "Since A only undercuts A if the edge runs from v to v , we cannot infer that A will affect the <br>status</br> of A from information about whether or not they are connected.",
                "The reason that we need the concept of the argumentation graph is that the properties of the argumentation graph tell us something about the set of arguments A the graph represents.",
                "When that set of arguments is constructed through a dialogue, there is a relationship between the structure of the argumentation graph and the protocol that governs the dialogue.",
                "It is the extent of the relationship between structure and protocol that is the main subject of this paper.",
                "To study this relationship, we need to establish a correspondence between a dialogue and an argumentation graph.",

                "Note that we only define relevance for the second move of the dialogue onwards because the first move is taken to identify the subject of the dialogue, that is, the central question that the dialogue is intended to answer, and hence it must be relevant to the dialogue, no matter what it is.",
                "In assuming this, we focus our attention on the same kind of dialogues as [18].",
                "We can think of relevance as enforcing a form of parsimony on a dialogue - it prevents agents from making statements that do not bear on the current state of the dialogue.",
                "This promotes efficiency, in the sense of limiting the number of moves in the dialogue, and, as in [15], prevents agents revealing information that they might better keep hidden.",

                "To show that it is a tree, we have to show that it is acyclic and connected.",

                "Proposition 3.1 tells us that to affect the <br>status</br> of an argument A , the node v representing the argument A that is effecting the change has to be connected to v , the node representing A , and so it follows that every new node added as a result of an R1relevant move will be connected to the argumentation graph.",
                "Thus AG is connected.",
                "Since a basic dialogue does not allow moves that are preempted, every edge that is added during construction is directed from the node that is added to one already in the graph (thus denoting that the argument A denoted by the added node, v, undercuts the argument A denoted by the node to which the connection is made, v , rather than the other way around).",
                "Since every edge that is added is directed from the new node to the rest of the graph, there can be no cycles.",

                "Thus v1 will always be the only root.",
                "The ruling out of pre-empted moves means that v1 will never cease to be a root, and so the argumentation graph will always have one root.",
                "Since every argumentation graph constructed by a basic dialogue is a tree with a single root, this means that the first node of every argumentation graph is the root.",

                "If a dialogue D always picks its moves m from the set M identified by protocol P, then D is said to conform to P.

                "In all such cases, a sequence of undercut relations relates the two arguments, and if they are both in an <br>argumentation</br> graph, this means that they are connected.",

                "Since A only undercuts A if the edge runs from v to v , we cannot infer that A will affect the status of A from information about whether or not they are connected.",
                "The reason that we need the concept of the <br>argumentation</br> graph is that the properties of the <br>argumentation</br> graph tell us something about the set of arguments A the graph represents.",

Proof.",

                "The second condition ensures that each branch is constructed in full before any new branch is added, and when a new branch is added, the argument that is undercut as part of the addition will be acceptable, and so the addition will change the status of the argument denoted by that node, and hence the root.",
                "With these conditions, every move required to construct AG(D)T will be permitted and so the <br>dialogue</br> will be topic-complete when every move has been completed.",
                "The second part of this result only identifies one possible way to ensure that the second condition in Proposition 5.3 is met, so the converse of this result does not hold.",

                "Early examples of argumentation-based approaches to multiagent agreement include the work of Dignum et al. [7], Kraus [14], Parsons and Jennings [16], Reed [23], Schroeder et al. [25] and Sycara [26].",

                "Viewing dialogues in this way, as in [2, 21], provides a powerful framework for analysing the formal properties of dialogues, and for identifying suitable protocols under which dialogues can be conducted [18, 20].",

                "Note that in the description that follows, we assume that is the classical inference relation, that ≡ stands for logical equivalence, and we use Δ to denote all the information available to an agent.",
                "Thus in a dialogue between two agents α and β, Δα = Σα ∪ CSα ∪ CSβ, so the commitment store CSα can be loosely thought of as a subset of Δα consisting of the assertions that have been made public.",
                "In some dialogue games, such as those in [18] anything in CSα is either in Σα or can be derived from it.",
                "In other dialogue games, such as 1006 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS those in [2], CSα may contain things that cannot be derived from Σα.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1007 The sequence of arguments put forward in the dialogue is determined by the agents who are taking part in the dialogue, but they are usually not completely free to choose what arguments they make.",

                "If we write the sequence of n moves m1, m2, . . . , mn as mn, and denote the empty sequence as m0, then we can define a profocol in the following way: Definition 3.2.",

                "If a dialogue D always picks its moves m from the set M identified by protocol P, then D is said to conform to P. Even if a dialogue conforms to a protocol, it is typically the case that the agent engaging in the dialogue has to make a choice of move - it has to choose which of the moves in M to make.",

                "Thus a root of a graph is a node to which directed edges may be connected, but from which no directed edges connect to other nodes.",

                "Thus in Figure 1, v is a root, and v is a <br>leaf</br>.",
                "The reason for the reversal of the usual notions of root and <br>leaf</br> is that, as we shall see, we will consider dialogues to construct argumentation graphs from the roots (in our sense) to the leaves.",
                "The reversal of the terminology means that it matches the natural process of tree construction.",
                "Since, as described above, argumentation graphs are allowed to be not connected (in the usual graph theory sense), it is helpful to distinguish nodes that are connected to other nodes, in particular to the root of the tree.",
                "We say that node v is connected to node v if and only if there is a path from v to v .",
                "Since edges represent undercut relations, the notion of connectedness between nodes captures the influence that one argument may have on another: Proposition 3.1.",

                "Proof.",
                "Given Definitions 2.5 and 2.6, the only ways in which A can affect the status of A is if A either undercuts A , or if A undercuts some argument A that undercuts A , or if A undercuts some A that undercuts some A that undercuts A , and so on.",
                "In all such cases, a sequence of undercut relations relates the two arguments, and if they are both in an argumentation graph, this means that they are connected.",
                "Since the notion of path ignores the direction of the directed arcs, nodes v and v are connected whether the edge between them runs from v to v or vice versa.",
                "Since A only undercuts A if the edge runs from v to v , we cannot infer that A will affect the status of A from information about whether or not they are connected.",
                "The reason that we need the concept of the argumentation graph is that the properties of the argumentation graph tell us something about the set of arguments A the graph represents.",
                "When that set of arguments is constructed through a dialogue, there is a relationship between the structure of the argumentation graph and the protocol that governs the dialogue.",
                "It is the extent of the relationship between structure and protocol that is the main subject of this paper.",
                "To study this relationship, we need to establish a correspondence between a dialogue and an argumentation graph.",
                "Given the definitions we have so far, this is simple: Definition 3.6.",

                "Thus a dialogue corresponds to an argumentation graph if and only if every argument made in the dialogue corresponds to a node in the graph, and every node in the graph corresponds to an argument made in the dialogue.",
                "This one-toone correspondence allows us to consider each node v in the graph to have an index i which is the index of the move in the dialogue that put forward the argument which that node represents.",
                "Thus we can, for example, refer to the third node in the argumentation graph, meaning the node that represents the argument put forward in the third move of the dialogue. 4.",
                "RELEVANCE Most work on dialogues is concerned with what we might call coherent dialogues, that is dialogues in which the participants are, as in the work of Walton and Krabbe [27], focused on resolving some question through the dialogue2 To capture this coherence, it seems we need a notion of relevance to constrain the statements made by agents.",
