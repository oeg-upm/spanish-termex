Hartline Microsoft Research 1065 La Avenida) Mountain View, CA 94043 hartline@microsoft.com Robert McGrew ∗ Computer Science Department Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305 bmcgrew@stanford.edu ABSTRACT We investigate the class of single-round, sealed-bid auctions for a set of identical items to bidders who each desire one unit. We adopt the worst-case competitive framework defined by [9, 5] that compares the profit of an auction to that of an optimal single-price sale of least two items. In this paper, we first derive an optimal auction for three items, answering an open question from [8]. Second, we show that the form of this auction is independent of the competitive framework used. Third, we propose a schema for converting a given limited-supply auction into an unlimited supply auction. Applying this technique to our optimal auction for three items, we achieve an auction with a competitive ratio of 3.25, which improves upon the previously best-known competitive ratio of 3.39 from [7]. Finally, we generalize a result from [8] and extend our understanding of the nature of the optimal competitive auction by showing that the optimal competitive auction occasionally offers prices that are higher than all bid values.

INTRODUCTION The research area of optimal mechanism design looks at designing a mechanism to produce the most desirable outcome for the entity running the mechanism. This problem is well studied for the auction design problem where the optimal mechanism is the one that brings the seller the most profit. Here, the classical approach is to design such a mechanism given the prior distribution from which the bidders preferences are drawn (See e.g., [12, 4]). Recently Goldberg et al. [9] introduced the use of worst-case competitive analysis (See e.g., [3]) to analyze the performance of auctions that have no knowledge of the prior distribution. The goal of such work is to design an auction that achieves a large constant fraction of the profit attainable by an optimal mechanism that knows the prior distribution in advance. Positive results in this direction are fueled by the observation that in auctions for a number of identical units, much of the distribution from which the bidders are drawn can be deduced on the fly by the auction as it is being run [9, 14, 2]. The performance of an auction in such a worst-case competitive analysis is measured by its competitive ratio, the ratio between a benchmark performance and the auctions performance on the input distribution that maximizes this ratio. The holy grail of the worstcase competitive analysis of auctions is the auction that achieves the optimal competitive ratio (as small as possible). Since [9] this search has led to improved understanding of the nature of the optimal auction, the techniques for on-the-fly pricing in these scenarios, and the competitive ratio of the optimal auction [5, 7, 8]. In this paper we continue this line of research by improving in all of these directions. Furthermore, we give evidence corroborating the conjecture that the form of the optimal auction is independent of the benchmark used in the auctions competitive analysis. This result further validates the use of competitive analysis in gauging auction performance. We consider the single item, multi-unit, unit-demand auction problem. In such an auction there are many units of a single item available for sale to bidders who each desire only one unit. Each bidder has a valuation representing how much the item is worth to him. The auction is performed by soliciting a sealed bid from each of the bidders and deciding on the allocation of units to bidders and the prices to be paid by the bidders. The bidders are assumed to bid so as to maximize their personal utility, the difference between their valuation and the price they pay. To handle the problem of designing and analyzing auctions where bidders may falsely declare their valuations to get a better deal, we will adopt the solution concept of truthful mechanism design (see, e.g., [9, 15, 13]). In a truthful auction, revealing ones true valuation as ones bid is an optimal strategy for each bidder regardless of the bids of the other bidders. In this paper, we will restrict our attention to truthful (a.k.a., incentive compatible or strategyproof) auctions. A particularly interesting special case of the auction problem is the unlimited supply case. In this case the number of units for sale is at least the number of bidders in the auction. This is natural for the sale of digital goods where there is negligible cost for duplicating 175 and distributing the good. Pay-per-view television and downloadable audio files are examples of such goods. The competitive framework introduced in [9] and further refined in [5] uses the profit of the optimal omniscient single priced mechanism that sells at least two units as the benchmark for competitive analysis. The assumption that two or more units are sold is necessary because in the worst case it is impossible to obtain a constant fraction of the profit of the optimal mechanism when it sells only one unit [9]. In this framework for competitive analysis, an auction is said to be β-competitive if it achieves a profit that is within a factor of β ≥ 1 of the benchmark profit on every input. The optimal auction is the one which is β-competitive with the minimum value of β. Previous to this work, the best known auction for the unlimited supply case had a competitive ratio of 3.39 [7] and the best lower bound known was 2.42 [8]. For the limited supply case, auctions can achieve substantially better competitive ratios. When there are only two units for sale, the optimal auction gives a competitive ratio of 2, which matches the lower bound for two units. When there are three units for sale, the best previously known auction had a competitive ratio of 2.3, compared with a lower bound of 13/6 ≈ 2.17 [8]. The results of this paper are as follows: • We give the auction for three units that is optimally competitive against the profit of the omniscient single priced mechanism that sells at least two units. This auction achieves a competitive ratio of 13/6, matching the lower bound from [8] (Section 3). • We show that the form of the optimal auction is independent of the benchmark used in competitive analysis. In doing so, we give an optimal three bidder auction for generalized benchmarks (Section 4). • We give a general technique for converting a limited supply auction into an unlimited supply auction where it is possible to use the competitive ratio of the limited supply auction to obtain a bound on the competitive ratio of the unlimited supply auction. We refer to auctions derived from this framework as aggregation auctions (Section 5). • We improve on the best known competitive ratio by proving that the aggregation auction constructed from our optimal three-unit auction is 3.25-competitive (Section 5.1). • Assuming that the conjecture that the optimal -unit auction has a competitive ratio that matches the lower bound proved in [8], we show that this optimal auction for ≥ 3 on some inputs will occasionally offer prices that are higher than any bid in that input (Section 6). For the three-unit case where we have shown that the lower bound of [8] is tight, this observation led to our construction of the optimal three-unit auction. 2. DEFINITIONS AND BACKGROUND We consider single-round, sealed-bid auctions for a set of identical units of an item to bidders who each desire one unit. As mentioned in the introduction, we adopt the game-theoretic solution concept of truthful mechanism design. A useful simplification of the problem of designing truthful auctions is obtained through the following algorithmic characterization [9]. Related formulations to this one have appeared in numerous places in recent literature (e.g., [1, 14, 5, 10]). DEFINITION 1. Given a bid vector of n bids, b = (b1, . . . , bn), let b-i denote the vector of with bi replaced with a ?, i.e., b-i = (b1, . . . , bi−1, ?, bi+1, . . . , bn). DEFINITION 2. Let f be a function from bid vectors (with a ?) to prices (non-negative real numbers). The deterministic bidindependent auction defined by f, BIf , works as follows. For each bidder i: 1. Set ti = f(b-i). 2. If ti < bi, bidder i wins at price ti. 3. If ti > bi, bidder i loses. 4. Otherwise, (ti = bi) the auction can either accept the bid at price ti or reject it. A randomized bid-independent auction is a distribution over deterministic bid-independent auctions. The proof of the following theorem can be found, for example, in [5]. THEOREM 1. An auction is truthful if and only if it is equivalent to a bid-independent auction. Given this equivalence, we will use the the terminology bidindependent and truthful interchangeably. For a randomized bid-independent auction, f(b-i) is a random variable. We denote the probability density of f(b-i) at z by ρb-i (z). We denote the profit of a truthful auction A on input b as A(b). The expected profit of the auction, E[A(b)], is the sum of the expected payments made by each bidder, which we denote by pi(b) for bidder i. Clearly, the expected payment of each bid satisfies pi(b) = bi 0 xρb-i (x)dx. 2.1 Competitive Framework We now review the competitive framework from [5]. In order to evaluate the performance of auctions with respect to the goal of profit maximization, we introduce the optimal single price omniscient auction F and the related omniscient auction F(2) . DEFINITION 3. Give a vector b = (b1, . . . , bn), let b(i) represent the i-th largest value in b. The optimal single price omniscient auction, F, is defined as follows. Auction F on input b determines the value k such that kb(k) is maximized. All bidders with bi ≥ b(k) win at price b(k); all remaining bidders lose. The profit of F on input b is thus F(b) = max1≤k≤n kb(k). In the competitive framework of [5] and subsequent papers, the performance of a truthful auction is gauged in comparison to F(2) , the optimal singled priced auction that sells at least two units. The profit of F(2) is max2≤k≤n kb(k) There are a number of reasons to choose this benchmark for comparison, interested readers should see [5] or [6] for a more detailed discussion. Let A be a truthful auction. We say that A is β-competitive against F(2) (or just β-competitive) if for all bid vectors b, the expected profit of A on b satisfies E[A(b)] ≥ F(2) (b) β . In Section 4 we generalize this framework to other profit benchmarks. 176 2.2 Scale Invariant and Symmetric Auctions A symmetric auction is one where the auction outcome is unchanged when the input bids arrive in a different permutation. Goldberg et al. [8] show that a symmetric auction achieves the optimal competitive ratio. This is natural as the profit benchmark we consider is symmetric, and it allows us to consider only symmetric auctions when looking for the one with the optimal competitive ratio. An auction defined by bid-independent function f is scale invariant if, for all i and all z, Pr[f(b-i) ≥ z] = Pr[f(cb-i) ≥ cz]. It is conjectured that the assumption of scale invariance is without loss of generality. Thus, we are motivated to consider symmetric scale-invariant auctions. When specifying a symmetric scaleinvariant auction we can assume that f is only a function of the relative magnitudes of the n − 1 bids in b-i and that one of the bids, bj = 1. It will be convenient to specify such auctions via the density function of f(b-i), ρb-i (z). It is enough to specify such a density function of the form ρ1,z1,...,zn−1 (z) with 1 ≤ zi ≤ zi+1. 2.3 Limited Supply Versus Unlimited Supply Following [8], throughout the remainder of this paper we will be making the assumption that n = , i.e., the number of bidders is equal to the number of units for sale. This is without loss of generality as (a) any lower bound that applies to the n = case also extends to the case where n ≥ [8], and (b) there is a reduction from the unlimited supply auction problem to the limited supply auction problem that takes an unlimited supply auction that is β-competitive with F(2) and constructs a limited supply auction parameterized by that is β-competitive with F(2, ) , the optimal omniscient auction that sells between 2 and units [6]. Henceforth, we will assume that we are in the unlimited supply case, and we will examine lower bounds for limited supply problems by placing a restriction on the number of bidders in the auction. 2.4 Lower Bounds and Optimal Auctions Frequently in this paper, we will refer to the best known lower bound on the competitive ratio of truthful auctions: THEOREM 2. [8] The competitive ratio of any auction on n bidders is at least 1 − n i=2 −1 n i−1 i i − 1 n − 1 i − 1 . DEFINITION 4. Let Υn denote the n-bidder auction that achieves the optimal competitive ratio. This bound is derived by analyzing the performance of any auction on the following distribution B. In each random bid vector B, each bid Bi is drawn i.i.d. from the distribution such that Pr[Bi ≥ s] ≤ 1/s for all s ∈ S. In the two-bidder case, this lower bound is 2. This is achieved by Υ2 which is the 1-unit Vickrey auction.1 In the three-bidder case, this lower bound is 13/6. In the next section, we define the auction Υ3 which matches this lower bound. In the four-bidder case, this lower bound is 96/215. In the limit as the number of bidders grows, this lower bound approaches a number which is approximately 2.42. It is conjectured that this lower bound is tight for any number of bidders and the optimal auction, Υn, matches it. 1 The 1-unit Vickrey auction sells to the highest bidder at the second highest bid value. 2.5 Profit Extraction In this section we review the truthful profit extraction mechanism ProfitExtractR. This mechanism is a special case of a general cost-sharing schema due to Moulin and Shenker [11]. The goal of profit extraction is, given bids b, to extract a target value R of profit from some subset of the bidders. ProfitExtractR: Given bids b, find the largest k such that the highest k bidders can equally share the cost R. Charge each of these bidders R/k. If no subset of bidders can cover the cost, the mechanism has no winners. Important properties of this auction are as follows: • ProfitExtractR is truthful. • If R ≤ F(b), ProfitExtractR(b) = R; otherwise it has no winners and no revenue. We will use this profit extraction mechanism in Section 5 with the following intuition. Such a profit extractor makes it possible to treat this subset of bidders as a single bid with value F(S). Note that given a single bid, b, a truthful mechanism might offer it price t and if t ≤ b then the bidder wins and pays t; otherwise the bidder pays nothing (and loses). Likewise, a mechanism can offer the set of bidders S a target revenue R. If R ≤ F(2) (S), then ProfitExtractR raises R from S; otherwise, the it raises no revenue from S. 3. AN OPTIMAL AUCTION FOR THREE BIDDERS In this section we define the optimal auction for three bidders, Υ3, and prove that it indeed matches the known lower bound of 13/6. We follow the definition and proof with a discussion of how this auction was derived. DEFINITION 5. Υ3 is scale-invariant and symmetric and given by the bid-independent function with density function ρ1,x(z) = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ For x ≤ 3/2 1 with probability 9/13 z with probability density g(z) for z > 3/2 For x > 3/2⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 1 with probability 9/13 − x 3/2 zg(z)dz x with probability x 3/2 (z + 1)g(z)dz z with probability density g(z) for z > x where g(x) = 2/13 (x−1)3 . THEOREM 3. The Υ3 auction has a competitive ratio of 13/6 ≈ 2.17, which is optimal. Furthermore, the auction raises exactly 6 13 F(2) on every input with non-identical bids. PROOF. Consider the bids 1, x, y, with 1 < x < y. There are three cases. CASE 1 (x < y ≤ 3/2): F(2) = 3. The auction must raise expected revenue of at least 18/13 on these bids. The bidder with valuation x will pay 1 with 9/13, and the bidder with valuation y will pay 1 with probability 9/13. Therefore Υ3 raises 18/13 on these bids. CASE 2 (x ≤ 3/2 < y): F(2) = 3. The auction must raise expected revenue of at least 18/13 on these bids. The bidder with 177 valuation x will pay 9/13 − y 3/2 zg(z)dz in expectation. The bidder with valuation y will pay 9/13 + y 3/2 zg(z)dz in expectation. Therefore Υ3 raises 18/13 on these bids. CASE 3 (3/2 < x ≤ y): F(2) = 2x. The auction must raise expected revenue of at least 12x/13 on these bids. Consider the revenue raised from all three bidders: E[Υ3(b)] = p(1, x, y) + p(x, 1, y) + p(y, 1, x) = 0 + 9/13 − y 3/2 zg(z)dz + 9/13 − x 3/2 zg(z)dz + x x 3/2 (z + 1)g(z)dz + y x zg(z)dz = 18/13 + (x − 2) x 3/2 zg(z)dz + x x 3/2 g(z)dz = 12x/13. The final equation comes from substituting in g(x) = 2/13 (x−1)3 and expanding the integrals. Note that the fraction of F(2) raised on every input is identical. If any of the inequalities 1 ≤ x ≤ y are not strict, the same proof applies giving a lower bound on the auctions profit; however, this bound may no longer be tight. Motivation for Υ3 In this section, we will conjecture that a particular input distribution is worst-case, and show, as a consequence, that all inputs are worstcase in the optimal auction. By applying this consequence, we will derive an optimal auction for three bidders. A truthful, randomized auction on n bidders can be represented by a randomized function f : Rn−1 × n → R that maps masked bid vectors to prices in R. By normalization, we can assume that the lowest possible bid is 1. Recall that ρb-i (z) = Pr[f(b-i) = z]. The optimal auction for the finite auction problem can be found by the following optimization problem in which the variables are ρb-i (z): maximize r subject to n i=1 bi z=1 zρb-i (z)dz ≥ rF(2) (b) ∞ z=1 ρb-i (z)dz = 1 ρb-i (z) ≥ 0 This set of integral inequalities is difficult to maximize over. However, by guessing which constraints are tight and which are slack at the optimum, we will be able to derive a set of differential equations for which any feasible solution is an optimal auction. As we discuss in Section 2.4, in [8], the authors define a distribution and use it to find a lower bound on the competitive ratio of the optimal auction. For two bidders, this bid distribution is the worst-case input distribution. We guess (and later verify) that this distribution is the worst-case input distribution for three bidders as well. Since this distribution has full support over the set of all bid vectors and a worst-case distribution puts positive probability only on worst-case inputs, we can therefore assume that all but a measure zero set of inputs is worst-case for the optimal auction. In the optimal two-bidder auction, all inputs with non-identical bids are worst-case, so we will assume the same for three bidders. The guess that these constraints are tight allows us to transform the optimization problem into a feasibility problem constrained by differential equations. If the solution to these equations has value matching the lower bound obtained from the worst-case distribution, then this solution is the optimal auction and that our conjectured choice of worst-case distribution is correct. In Section 6 we show that the optimal auction must sometimes place probability mass on sale prices above the highest bid. This motivates considering symmetric scale-invariant auctions for three bidders with probability density function, ρ1,x(z), of the following form: ρ1,x(z) = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 1 with discrete probability a(x) x with discrete probability b(x) z with probability density g(z) for z > x In this auction, the sale price for the first bidder is either one of the latter two bids, or higher than either bid with a probability density which is independent of the input. The feasibility problem which arises from the linear optimization problem by assuming the constraints are tight is as follows: a(y) + a(x) + xb(x) + y x zg(z)dz = r max(3, 2x) ∀x < y a(x) + b(x) + ∞ x g(z)dz = 1 a(x) ≥ 0 b(x) ≥ 0 g(z) ≥ 0 Solving this feasibility problem gives the auction Υ3 proposed above. The proof of its optimality validates its proposed form. Finding a simple restriction on the form of n-bidder auctions for n > 3 under which the optimal auction can be found analytically as above remains an open problem. 4. GENERALIZED PROFIT BENCHMARKS In this section, we widen our focus beyond auctions that compete with F(2) to consider other benchmarks for an auctions profit. We will show that, for three bidders, the form of the optimal auction is essentially independent of the benchmark profit used. This results strongly corroborates the worst-case competitive analysis of auctions by showing that our techniques allow us to derive auctions which are competitive against a broad variety of reasonable benchmarks rather than simply against F(2) . Previous work in competitive analysis of auctions has focused on the question of designing the auction with the best competitive ratio against F(2) , the profit of the optimal omniscient single-priced mechanism that sells at least two items. However, it is reasonable to consider other benchmarks. For instance, one might wish to compete against V∗ , the profit of the k-Vickrey auction with optimal-inhindsight choice of k.2 Alternatively, if an auction is being used as a subroutine in a larger mechanism, one might wish to choose the auction which is optimally competitive with a benchmark specific to that purpose. Recall that F(2) (b) = max2≥k≥n kb(k). We can generalize this definition to Gs, parameterized by s = (s2, . . . , sn) and defined as: Gs(b) = max 2≤k≤n skb(k). When considering Gs we assume without loss of generality that si < si+1 as otherwise the constraint imposed by si+1 is irrelevant. Note that F(2) is the special case of Gs with si = i, and that V∗ = Gs with si = i − 1. 2 Recall that the k-Vickrey auction sells a unit to each of the highest k bidders at a price equal to the k + 1st highest bid, b(k+1), achieving a profit of kb(k+1). 178 Competing with Gs We will now design a three-bidder auction Υs,t 3 that achieves the optimal competitive ratio against Gs,t. As before, we will first find a lower bound on the competitive ratio and then design an auction to meet that bound. We can lower bound the competitive ratio of Υs,t 3 using the same worst-case distribution from [8] that we used against F(2) . Evaluating the performance of any auction competing against Gs,t on this distribution will yield the following theorem. We denote the optimal auction for three bidders against Gs,t as Υs,t 3 . THEOREM 4. The optimal three-bidder auction, Υs,t 3 , competing against Gs,t(b) = max(sb(2), tb(3)) has a competitive ratio of at least s2 +t2 2t . The proof can be found in the appendix. Similarly, we can find the optimal auction against Gs,t using the same technique we used to solve for the three bidder auction with the best competitive ratio against F(2) . DEFINITION 6. Υs,t 3 is scale-invariant and symmetric and given by the bid-independent function with density function ρ1,x(z) = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ For x ≤ t s 1 with probability t2 s2+t2 z with probability density g(z) for z > t s For x > t s⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ 1 with probability t2 s2+t2 − x t s zg(z)dz x with probability x t s (z + 1)g(z)dz z with probability density g(z) for z > x where g(x) = 2(t−s)2 /(s2 +t2 ) (x−1)3 . THEOREM 5. Υs,t 3 is s2 +t2 2t -competitive with Gs,t. This auction, like Υ3, can be derived by reducing the optimization problem to a feasibility problem, guessing that the optimal solution has the same form as Υs,t 3 , and solving. The auction is optimal because it matches the lower bound found above. Note that the form of Υs,t 3 is essentially the same as for Υ3, but that the probability of each price is scaled depending on the values of s and t. That our auction for three bidders matches the lower bound computed by the input distribution used in [8] is strong evidence that this input distribution is the worst-case input distribution for any number of bidders and any generalized profit benchmark. Furthermore, we strongly suspect that for any number of bidders, the form of the optimal auction will be independent of the benchmark used. 5. AGGREGATION AUCTIONS We have seen that optimal auctions for small cases of the limitedsupply model can be found analytically. In this section, we will construct a schema for turning limited supply auctions into unlimited supply auctions with a good competitive ratio. As discussed in Section 2.5, the existence of a profit extractor, ProfitExtractR, allows an auction to treat a set of bids S as a single bid with value F(S). Given n bidders and an auction, Am, for m < n bidders, we can convert the m-bidder auction into an n-bidder auction by randomly partitioning the bidders into m subsets and then treating each subset as a single bidder (via ProfitExtractR) and running the m-bidder auction. DEFINITION 7. Given a truthful m-bidder auction, Am, the m-aggregation auction for Am, AggAm , works as follows: 1. Cast each bid uniformly at random into one of m bins, resulting in bid vectors b(1) , . . . , b(m) . 2. For each bin j, compute the aggregate bid Bj = F(b(j) ). Let B be the vector of aggregate bids, and B−j be the aggregate bids for all bins other than j. 3. Compute the aggregate price Tj = f(B−j), where f is the bid-independent function for Am. 4. For each bin j, run ProfitExtractTj on b(j) . Since Am and ProfitExtractR are truthful, Tj is computed independently of any bid in bin j and thus the price offered any bidder in b(j) is independent of his bid; therefore, THEOREM 6. If Am is truthful, the m-aggregation auction for Am, AggAm , is truthful. Note that this schema yields a new way of understanding the Random Sampling Profit Extraction (RSPE) auction [5] as the simplest case of an aggregation auction. It is the 2-aggregation auction for Υ2, the 1-unit Vickrey auction. To analyze AggAm , consider throwing k balls into m labeled bins. Let k represent a configuration of balls in bins, so that ki is equal to the number of balls in bin i, and k(i) is equal to the number of balls in the ith largest bin. Let Km,k represent the set of all possible configurations of k balls in m bins. We write the multinomial coefficient of k as k k . The probability that a particular configuration k arises by throwing balls into bins uniformly at random is k k m−k . THEOREM 7. Let Am be an auction with competitive ratio β. Then the m-aggregation auction for Am, AggAm , raises the following fraction of the optimal revenue F(2) (b): E AggAm (b) F(2) ≥ min k≥2 k∈Km,k F(2) (k) k k βkmk PROOF. By definition, F(2) sells to k ≥ 2 bidders at a single price p. Let kj be the number of such bidders in b(j) . Clearly, F(b(j) ) ≥ pkj. Therefore, F(2) (F(b(1) ), . . . , F(b(n) )) F(2)(b) ≥ F(2) (pk1, . . . , pkn) pk = F(2) (k1, . . . , kn) k The inequality follows from the monotonicity of F(2) , and the equality from the homogeneity of F(2) . ProfitExtractTj will raise Tj if Tj ≤ Bj , and no profit otherwise. Thus, E AggAm (b) ≥ E F(2) (B)/β . The theorem follows by rewriting this expectation as a sum over all k in Km,k. 5.1 A 3.25 Competitive Auction We apply the aggregation auction schema to Υ3, our optimal auction for three bidders, to achieve an auction with competitive ratio 3.25. This improves on the previously best known auction which is 3.39-competitive [7]. THEOREM 8. The aggregation auction for Υ3 has competitive ratio 3.25. 179 PROOF. By theorem 7, E AggΥ3 (b) F(2)(b) ≥ min k≥2 k i=1 k−i j=1 F(2) (i, j, k − i − j) k i,j,k−i−j βk3k For k = 2 and k = 3, E AggΥ3 (b) = 2 3 k/β. As k increases, E AggΥ3 (b) /F(2) increases as well. Since we do not expect to find a closed-form formula for the revenue, we lower bound F(2) (b) by 3b(3). Using large deviation bounds, one can show that this lower bound is greater than 2 3 k/β for large-enough k, and the remainder can be shown by explicit calculation. Plugging in β = 13/6, the competitive ratio is 13/4. As k increases, the competitive ratio approaches 13/6. Note that the above bound on the competitive ratio of AggΥ3 is tight. To see this, consider the bid vector with two very large and non-identical bids of h and h + with the remaining bids 1. Given that the competitive ratio of Υ3 is tight on this example, the expected revenue of this auction on this input will be exactly 13/4. 5.2 A Gs,t-based Aggregation Auction In this section we show that Υ3 is not the optimal auction to use in an aggregation auction. One can do better by choosing the auction that is optimally competitive against a specially tailored benchmark. To see why this might be the case, notice (Table 1) that the fraction of F(2) (b) raised for when there are k = 2 and k = 3 winning bidders in F(2) (b) is substantially smaller than the fraction of F(2) (b) raised when there are more winners. This occurs because the expected ratio between F(2) (B) and F(2) (b) is lower in this case while the competitive ratio of Υ3 is constant. If we chose a three bidder auction that performed better when F(2) has smaller numbers of winners, our aggregation auction would perform better in the worst case. One approach is to compete against a different benchmark that puts more weight than F(2) on solutions with a small number of winners. Recall that F(2) is the instance of Gs,t with s = 2 and t = 3. By using the auction that competes optimally against Gs,t with s > 2, while holding t = 3, we will raise a higher fraction of revenue on smaller numbers of winning bidders and a lower fraction of revenue on large numbers of winning bidders. We can numerically optimize the values of s and t in Gs,t(b) in order to achieve the best competitive ratio for the aggregation auction. In fact, this will allow us to improve our competitive ratio slightly. THEOREM 9. For an optimal choice of s and t, the aggregation auction for Υs,t 3 is 3.243-competitive. The proof follows the outline of Theorem 7 and 8 with the optimal choice of s = 2.162 (while t is held constant at 3). 5.3 Further Reducing the Competitive Ratio There are a number of ways we might attempt to use this aggregation auction schema to continue to push the competitive ratio down. In this section, we give a brief discussion of several attempts. 5.3.1 AggΥm for m > 3 If the aggregation auction for Υ2 has a competitive ratio of 4 and the aggregation auction for Υ3 has a competitive ratio of 3.25, can we improve the competitive ratio by aggregating Υ4 or Υm for larger m? We conjecture in the negative: for m > 3, the aggregation auction for Υm has a larger competitive ratio than the aggregation auction for Υ3.

The lowest value for each column is printed in bold. conjecture lies in the difficulty of finding a closed-form solution for the formula of Theorem 7. We can, however, evaluate this formula numerically for different values of m and k, assuming that the competitive ratio for Υm matches the lower bound for m given by Theorem 2. Table 1 shows, for each value of m and k, the fraction of F(2) raised by the aggregation auction for AggΥm when there are k winning bidders, assuming the lower bound of Theorem 2 is tight. 5.3.2 Convex combinations of AggΥm As can be seen in Table 1, when m > 3, the worst-case value of k is no longer 2 and 3, but instead an increasing function of m. An aggregation auction for Υm outperforms the aggregation auction for Υ3 when there are two or three winning bidders, while the aggregation auction for Υ3 outperforms the other when there are at least six winning bidders. Thus, for instance, an auction which randomizes between aggregation auctions for Υ3 and Υ4 will have a worst-case which is better than that of either auction alone. Larger combinations of auctions will allow more room to optimize the worst-case. However, we suspect that no convex combination of aggregation auctions will have a competitive ratio lower than 3. Furthermore, note that we cannot yet claim the existence of a good auction via this technique as the optimal auction Υn for n > 3 is not known and it is only conjectured that the bound given by Theorem 2 and represented in Table 1 is correct for Υn. 6. A LOWER BOUND FOR CONSERVATIVE AUCTIONS In this section, we define a class of auctions that never offer a sale price which is higher than any bid in the input and prove a lower bound on the competitive ratio of these auctions. As this 180 lower bound is stronger than the lower bound of Theorem 2 for n ≥ 3, it shows that the optimal auction must occasionally charge a sales price higher than any bid in the input. Specifically, this result partially explains the form of the optimal three bidder auction. DEFINITION 8. We say an auction BIf is conservative if its bidindependent function f satisfies f(b-i) ≤ max(b-i). We can now state our lower bound for conservative auctions. THEOREM 10. Let A be a conservative auction for n bidders. Then the competitive ratio of A is at least 3n−2 n . COROLLARY 1. The competitive ratio of any conservative auction for an arbitrary number of bidders is at least three. For a two-bidder auction, this restriction does not prevent optimality. Υ2, the 1-unit Vickrey auction, is conservative. For larger numbers of bidders, however, the restriction to conservative auctions does affect the competitive ratio. For the three-bidder case, Υ3 has competitive ratio 2.17, while the best conservative auction is no better than 2.33-competitive. The k-Vickrey auction and the Random Sampling Optimal Price auction [9] are conservative auctions. The Random Sampling Profit Extraction auction [5] and the CORE auction [7], on the other hand, use the ProfitExtractR mechanism as a subroutine and thus sometimes offer a sale price which is higher than the highest input bid value. In [8], the authors define a restricted auction as one on which, for any input, the sale prices are drawn from the set of input bid values. The class of conservative auctions can be viewed as a generalization of the class of restricted auctions and therefore our result below gives lower bounds on the performance of a broader class of auctions. We will prove Theorem 10 with the aid of the following lemma: LEMMA 1. Let A be a conservative auction with competitive ratio 1/r for n bidders. Let h n. Let h0 = 1 and hk = kh otherwise. Then, for all k and H ≥ kh, Pr[f(1, 1, . . . , 1, H) ≤ hk] ≥ nr−1 n−1 + k(3nr−2r−n n−1 ). PROOF. The lemma is proved by strong induction on k. First some notation that will be convenient. For any particular k and H we will be considering the bid vector b = (1, . . . , 1, hk, H) and placing bounds on ρb-i (z). Since we can assume without loss of generality that the auction is symmetric, we will notate b-1 as b with any one of the 1-valued bids masked. Similarly we notate b-hk (resp. b-H ) as b with the hk-valued bid (resp. H-valued bid) masked. We will also let p1(b), phk (b), and pH (b) represent the expected payment of a 1-valued, hk-valued, and H-valued bidder in A on b, respectively (note by symmetry the expected payment for all 1-valued bidders is the same). Base case (k = 0, hk = 1): A must raise revenue of at least rn on b = (1, . . . , 1, 1, H): rn ≤ pH (b) + (n − 1)p1(b) = 1 + (n − 1) 1 0 xρb-1 (x)dx ≤ 1 + (n − 1) 1 0 ρb-1 (x)dx The second inequality follows from the conservatism of the underlying auction. The base case follows trivially from the final inequality. Inductive case (k > 0, hk = kh): Let b = (1, . . . , 1, hk, H). First, we will find an upper bound on pH(b) pH (b) = 1 0 xρb-H (x)dx + k i=1 hi hi−1 xρb-H (x)dx (1) ≤ 1 + k i=1 hi hi hi−1 ρb-H (x)dx ≤ 1 + 3nr − 2r − n n − 1 k−1 i=1 ih + kh 1 − nr − 1 n − 1 − (k − 1) 3nr − 2r − n n − 1 (2) = kh n(1 − r) n − 1 + (k − 1) 2 3nr − 2r − n n − 1 + 1. (3) Equation (1) follows from the conservatism of A and (2) is from invoking the strong inductive hypothesis with H = kh and the observation that the maximum possible revenue will be found by placing exactly enough probability at each multiple of h to satisfy the constraints of the inductive hypothesis and placing the remaining probability at kh. Next, we will find a lower bound on phk (b) by considering the revenue raised by the bids b. Recall that A must obtain a profit of at least rF(2) (b) = 2rkh. Given upper-bounds on the profit from the H-valued, equation bid (3), and the 1-valued bids, the profit from the hk-valued bid must be at least: phk (b) ≥ 2rkh − (n − 2)p1(b) − pH(b) ≥ kh 2r − n(1 − r) n − 1 + (k − 1) 2 3nr − 2r − n n − 1 − O(n). (4) In order to lower bound Pr[f(b-hk ) ≤ kh], consider the auction that minimizes it and is consistent with the lower bounds obtained by the strong inductive hypothesis on Pr[f(b-hk ) ≤ ih]. To minimize the constraints implied by the strong inductive hypothesis, we place the minimal amount of probability mass required each price level. This gives ρhk (b) with nr−1 n−1 probability at 1 and exactly 3nr−2r−n n−1 at each hi for 1 ≤ i < k. Thus, the profit from offering prices at most hk−1 is nr−1 n−1 −kh(k−1)3nr−2r−n n−1 . In order to satisfy our lower bound, (4), on phk (b), it must put at least 3nr−2r−n n−1 on hk. Therefore, the probability that the sale price will be no more than kh on masked bid vector on bid vector b = (1, . . . , 1, kh, H) must be at least nr−1 n−1 + k(3nr−2r−n n−1 ). Given Lemma 1, Theorem 10 is simple to prove. PROOF. Let A be a conservative auction. Suppose 3nr−2r−n n−1 = > 0. Let k = 1/ , H ≥ kh, and h n. By Lemma 1, Pr[f(1, . . . , 1, kh, H) ≤ hk] ≥ nr−1 n−1 + k > 1. But this is a contradiction, so 3nr−2r−n n−1 ≤ 0. Thus, r ≤ n 3n−2 . The theorem follows. 7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have found the optimal auction for the three-unit limitedsupply case, and shown that its structure is essentially independent of the benchmark used in its competitive analysis. We have then used this auction to derive the best known auction for the unlimited supply case. Our work leaves many interesting open questions. We found that the lower bound of [8] is matched by an auction for three bidders, 181 even when competing against generalized benchmarks. The most interesting open question from our work is whether the lower bound from Theorem 2 can be matched by an auction for more than three bidders. We conjecture that it can. Second, we consider whether our techniques can be extended to find optimal auctions for greater numbers of bidders. The use of our analytic solution method requires knowledge of a restricted class of auctions which is large enough to contain an optimal auction but small enough that the optimal auction in this class can be found explicitly through analytic methods. No class of auctions which meets these criteria is known even for the four bidder case. Also, when the number of bidders is greater than three, it might be the case that the optimal auction is not expressible in terms of elementary functions. Another interesting set of open questions concerns aggregation auctions. As we show, the aggregation auction for Υ3 outperforms the aggregation auction for Υ2 and it appears that the aggregation auction for Υ3 is better than Υm for m > 3. We leave verification of this conjecture for future work. We also show that Υ3 is not the best three-bidder auction for use in an aggregation auction, but the auction that beats it is able to reduce the competitive ratio of the overall auction only a little bit. It would be interesting to know whether for any m there is an m-aggregation auction that substantially improves on the competitive ratio of AggΥm . Finally, we remark that very little is known about the structure of the optimal competitive auction. In our auction Υ3, the sales price for a given bidder is restricted either to be one of the other bid values or to be higher than all other bid values. The optimal auction for two bidders, the 1-unit Vickrey auction, also falls within this class of auctions, as its sales prices are restricted to bid values. We conjecture that an optimal auction for any number of bidders lies within this class. Our paper provides partial evidence for this conjecture: the lower bound of Section 6 on conservative auctions shows that the optimal auction must offer sales prices higher than any bid value if the lower bound of Theorem 2 is tight, as is conjectured. It remains to show that optimal auctions otherwise only offer sales prices at bid values. 8. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors wish to thank Yoav Shoham and Noga Alon for helpful discussions. 9.

Our proof follows the outline of the proof of Lemma 5 and Theorem 1 from [8]; however, our case is simpler because we only looking for a bound when n = 3. Define the random bid vector B = (B1, B2, B3) with Pr[Bi > z] = 1/z. We compute EB[Gs,t(B)] by integrating Pr[Gs,t(B) > z]. Then we use the fact that no auction can have expected profit greater than 3 on B to find a lower bound on the competitive ratio against Gs,t for any auction. For the input distribution B defined above, let B(i) be the ith largest bid. Define the disjoint events H2 = B(2) ≥ z/s ∧ B(3) < z/t, and H3 = B(3) ≥ z/t. Intuitively, H3 corresponds to the event that all three bidders win in Gs,t, while H2 corresponds to the event that only the top two bidders win. Gs,t(B) will be greater than z if either event occurs: Pr[Gs,t(B) > z] = Pr[H2] + Pr[H3] (5) = 3 s z 2 1 − t z + t z 3 (6) Using the identity defined for non-negative continuous random variables that E[X] = ∞ 0 Pr[X > x] dx, we have EB[Gs,t(B)] = t + ∞ t 3 s z 2 1 − t z + t z 3 dz (7) = 3 s2 + t2 2t (8) Given that, for any auction A, EB[EA[A(B)]] ≤ 3 [8], it is clear that EB[Gs,t(B)] EB[EA[A(B)]] ≥ s2 +t2 2t . Therefore, there exists some input b for each auction A such that Gs,t(b) EA[A(b)] ≥ s2+t2 2t . 182",

Introducción El área de investigación del diseño de mecanismo óptimo analiza el diseño de un mecanismo para producir el resultado más deseable para la entidad que ejecuta el mecanismo. Este problema está bien estudiado para el problema de diseño de la subasta, donde el mecanismo óptimo es el que le da al vendedor más ganancias. Aquí, el enfoque clásico es diseñar dicho mecanismo dada la distribución previa a partir de la cual se dibujan las preferencias de los postores (ver, por ejemplo, [12, 4]). Recientemente Goldberg et al.[9] introdujo el uso de un análisis competitivo en el peor de los casos (ver, por ejemplo, [3]) para analizar el rendimiento de las subastas que no tienen conocimiento de la distribución previa. El objetivo de dicho trabajo es diseñar una subasta que logre una gran fracción constante de la ganancia alcanzable por un mecanismo óptimo que conozca la distribución previa de antemano. Los resultados positivos en esta dirección son alimentados por la observación de que en las subastas para una serie de unidades idénticas, gran parte de la distribución a partir de la cual se dibujan los postores se puede deducir sobre la mosca por la subasta a medida que se ejecuta [9, 14, 2] El rendimiento de una subasta en el análisis competitivo tan peor de los casos se mide por su relación competitiva, la relación entre un rendimiento de referencia y el rendimiento de las subastas en la distribución de entrada que maximiza esta relación. El santo grial del análisis competitivo de las subastas del peor caso es la subasta que logra la relación competitiva óptima (lo más pequeña posible). Desde [9] esta búsqueda ha llevado a una mejor comprensión de la naturaleza de la subasta óptima, las técnicas para los precios sobre la marcha en estos escenarios y la relación competitiva de la subasta óptima [5, 7, 8]. En este artículo continuamos esta línea de investigación mejorando en todas estas direcciones. Además, damos evidencia que corrobora la conjetura de que la forma de la subasta óptima es independiente del punto de referencia utilizado en el análisis competitivo de las subastas. Este resultado valida aún más el uso de análisis competitivos en el rendimiento de la subasta de medición. Consideramos el problema de subasta de un solo elemento, múltiples unidades, unitaria. En una subasta de este tipo hay muchas unidades de un solo artículo disponible para la venta a los postores que desean solo una unidad. Cada postor tiene una valoración que representa cuánto vale el artículo para él. La subasta se realiza solicitando una oferta sellada de cada uno de los licitadores y decidiendo la asignación de unidades a los licitadores y los precios que los licitadores pagarán. Se supone que los postores ofertan para maximizar su utilidad personal, la diferencia entre su valoración y el precio que pagan. Para manejar el problema de diseñar y analizar subastas donde los postores pueden declarar falsamente sus valoraciones para obtener un mejor trato, adoptaremos el concepto de solución del diseño del mecanismo veraz (ver, por ejemplo, [9, 15, 13]). En una subasta veraz, revelar la verdadera valoración como oferta es una estrategia óptima para cada postor, independientemente de las ofertas de los otros postores. En este artículo, restringiremos nuestra atención a las subastas veraz (también conocidas como, compatibles con incentivos o a prueba de estrategias). Un caso especial particularmente interesante del problema de la subasta es el caso de suministro ilimitado. En este caso, el número de unidades a la venta es al menos el número de licitadores en la subasta. Esto es natural para la venta de bienes digitales donde hay un costo insignificante para duplicar 175 y distribuir el bien. Los archivos de audio de pago por visión de pago por visión son ejemplos de dichos productos. El marco competitivo introducido en [9] y refinado aún más en [5] utiliza la ganancia del mecanismo óptimo de precio único omnisciente que vende al menos dos unidades como punto de referencia para el análisis competitivo. La suposición de que se venden dos o más unidades es necesaria porque en el peor de los casos es imposible obtener una fracción constante de la ganancia del mecanismo óptimo cuando vende solo una unidad [9]. En este marco para el análisis competitivo, se dice que una subasta es competitiva β si logra un beneficio que se encuentra dentro de un factor de β ≥ 1 de la ganancia de referencia en cada entrada. La subasta óptima es la que es competitiva β con el valor mínimo de β. Antes de este trabajo, la subasta más conocida para el caso de suministro ilimitado tenía una relación competitiva de 3.39 [7] y el mejor límite inferior conocido fue 2.42 [8]. Para el caso de suministro limitado, las subastas pueden lograr relaciones competitivas sustancialmente mejores. Cuando solo hay dos unidades a la venta, la subasta óptima ofrece una relación competitiva de 2, que coincide con el límite inferior con dos unidades. Cuando hay tres unidades para la venta, la mejor subasta previamente conocida tenía una relación competitiva de 2.3, en comparación con un límite inferior de 13/6 ≈ 2.17 [8]. Los resultados de este documento son los siguientes: • Damos la subasta de tres unidades que son óptimamente competitivas contra la ganancia del mecanismo omnisciente de precio único que vende al menos dos unidades. Esta subasta logra una relación competitiva de 13/6, que coincide con el límite inferior de [8] (Sección 3).• Mostramos que la forma de la subasta óptima es independiente del punto de referencia utilizado en el análisis competitivo. Al hacerlo, damos una subasta óptima de tres postor para puntos de referencia generalizados (Sección 4).• Damos una técnica general para convertir una subasta de suministro limitada en una subasta de suministro ilimitada donde es posible utilizar la relación competitiva de la subasta de suministro limitada para obtener un límite en la relación competitiva de la subasta de suministro ilimitada. Nos referimos a las subastas derivadas de este marco como subastas de agregación (Sección 5).• Mejoramos la relación competitiva más conocida al demostrar que la subasta de agregación construida a partir de nuestra subasta óptima de tres unidades es de 3.25 competitiva (sección 5.1).• Suponiendo que la conjetura de que la subasta de unidades óptimas tiene una relación competitiva que coincide con el límite inferior demostrado en [8], mostramos que esta subasta óptima para ≥ 3 en algunos insumos ocasionalmente ofrecerá precios más altos que cualquier oferta en la queentrada (Sección 6). Para el caso de tres unidades donde hemos demostrado que el límite inferior de [8] es apretado, esta observación condujo a nuestra construcción de la subasta óptima de tres unidades.2. Definiciones y antecedentes Consideramos subastas de hasta una sola ronda para un conjunto de unidades idénticas de un elemento a los postores que cada uno desean una unidad. Como se menciona en la introducción, adoptamos el concepto de solución teórica del juego del diseño del mecanismo veraz. Se obtiene una simplificación útil del problema del diseño de subastas veraz a través de la siguiente caracterización algorítmica [9]. Las formulaciones relacionadas con este han aparecido en numerosos lugares en la literatura reciente (por ejemplo, [1, 14, 5, 10]). Definición 1. Dado un vector de oferta de n ofertas, b = (b1, ..., bn), deje que B-i denote el vector de con bi reemplazado por un?, Es decir, b-i = (b1, ..., bi-1,?Bi+1, ..., Bn). Definición 2. Sea f una función de los vectores de oferta (con un?) A los precios (números reales no negativos). La subasta determinista de BidIndependente definida por F, BIF, funciona de la siguiente manera. Para cada postor i: 1. Establecer ti = f (b-i).2. Si ti <bi, el postor i gana al precio ti.3. Si ti> bi, el postor, pierde.4. De lo contrario, (ti = bi) la subasta puede aceptar la oferta al precio TI o rechazarla. Una subasta aleatorizada independiente de la oferta es una distribución sobre las subastas deterministas independientes de BID. La prueba del siguiente teorema se puede encontrar, por ejemplo, en [5]. Teorema 1. Una subasta es veraz si y solo si es equivalente a una subasta independiente de oferta. Dada esta equivalencia, utilizaremos la terminología BidIndependiente y sincera indistintamente. Para una subasta aleatoria independiente de BID, F (B-I) es una variable aleatoria. Denotamos la densidad de probabilidad de F (B-I) en Z por ρb-I (Z). Denotamos el beneficio de una subasta veraz A en la entrada B como A (b). El beneficio esperado de la subasta, e [a (b)], es la suma de los pagos esperados realizados por cada licitador, que denotamos por PI (b) para el postor i. Claramente, el pago esperado de cada oferta satisface pi (b) = bi 0 xρb-i (x) dx.2.1 Marco competitivo ahora revisamos el marco competitivo de [5]. Para evaluar el rendimiento de las subastas con respecto al objetivo de la maximización de ganancias, presentamos la subasta omnisciente de precio único óptimo F y la subasta omnisciente relacionada F (2). Definición 3. Dé un vector b = (b1, .., bn), que b (i) represente el valor más grande del i-th en b. La subasta omnisciente de precio único óptimo, F, se define de la siguiente manera. La subasta F en la entrada B determina el valor k de tal manera que Kb (k) se maximiza. Todos los postores con BI ≥ B (k) ganan al precio B (k);Todos los postores restantes pierden. El beneficio de F en la entrada B es, por lo tanto, f (b) = max1≤k≤n kb (k). En el marco competitivo de [5] y los documentos posteriores, el rendimiento de una subasta veraz se mide en comparación con F (2), la subasta óptima de precios individuales que vende al menos dos unidades. El beneficio de F (2) es max2≤k≤n kb (k) Hay varias razones para elegir este punto de referencia para la comparación, los lectores interesados deberían ver [5] o [6] para una discusión más detallada. Que A sea una subasta veraz. Decimos que A es competitivo β contra F (2) (o simplemente β-competitivo) Si para todos los vectores de oferta B, el beneficio esperado de A en B satisface E [A (B)] ≥ F (2) (B)β. En la Sección 4 generalizamos este marco a otros puntos de referencia de ganancias.176 2.2 Subastas invariantes y simétricas Una subasta simétrica es aquella en la que el resultado de la subasta no cambia cuando las ofertas de entrada llegan en una permutación diferente. Goldberg et al.[8] muestran que una subasta simétrica logra la relación competitiva óptima. Esto es natural ya que el punto de referencia de ganancias que consideramos es simétrico, y nos permite considerar solo subastas simétricas cuando buscan la que tiene la relación competitiva óptima. Una subasta definida por la función independiente de BID F es la escala invariante si, para todas las I y todas las z, PR [F (B-I) ≥ Z] = PR [F (CB-I) ≥ CZ]. Se conjetura que la suposición de invariancia de escala no tiene pérdida de generalidad. Por lo tanto, estamos motivados para considerar subastas simétricas invariantes a escala. Al especificar una subasta simétrica de escala-invariante, podemos suponer que F es solo una función de las magnitudes relativas de las ofertas N-1 en B-I y que una de las ofertas, BJ = 1. Será conveniente especificar tales subastas a través de la función de densidad de F (B-I), ρb-I (Z). Es suficiente especificar tal función de densidad de la forma ρ1, z1, ..., zn - 1 (z) con 1 ≤ zi ≤ zi+1.2.3 Suministro limitado versus suministro ilimitado después [8], durante el resto de este documento, supuse que n =, es decir, el número de postores es igual al número de unidades para la venta. Esto es sin pérdida de generalidad como (a) cualquier límite inferior que se aplique al caso n = también se extiende al caso donde n ≥ [8] y (b) hay una reducción del problema de subasta de suministro ilimitado al suministro limitadoProblema de subasta que toma una subasta de suministro ilimitada que es competitiva β con F (2) y construye una subasta de suministro limitada parametrizada por eso es competitiva β con F (2,), la subasta omnisciente óptima que vende entre 2 y unidades [6] En adelante, asumiremos que estamos en el caso de suministro ilimitado, y examinaremos los límites inferiores para obtener problemas de suministro limitados al colocar una restricción en el número de licitadores en la subasta.2.4 Límites inferiores y subastas óptimas con frecuencia en este documento, nos referiremos al límite inferior más conocido en la relación competitiva de subastas veraces: Teorema 2. [8] La relación competitiva de cualquier subasta en n postores es al menos 1 - n i = =2 −1 n i - 1 i i - 1 n - 1 i - 1. Definición 4. Deje que denote la subasta N-Bidder que logra la relación competitiva óptima. Este límite se deriva analizando el rendimiento de cualquier subasta en la siguiente distribución B. En cada vector de oferta aleatoria B, cada BID BI se dibuja I.I.D.A partir de la distribución de tal manera que PR [BI ≥ S] ≤ 1/S para todos S ∈ S. En el caso de dos veteranos, este límite inferior es 2. Esto se logra por υ2, que es la subasta de Vickrey de 1 unidad.1 En el caso de tres traseros, este límite inferior es 13/6. En la siguiente sección, definimos la subasta υ3 que coincide con este límite inferior. En el caso de cuatro traseros, este límite inferior es 96/215. En el límite a medida que crece el número de postores, este límite inferior se acerca a un número que es aproximadamente 2.42. Se conjeturan que este límite inferior es apretado para cualquier número de postores y la subasta óptima, υn, lo coincide.1 La subasta de Vickrey de 1 unidad se vende al mejor postor con el segundo valor de oferta más alto.2.5 Extracción de ganancias En esta sección revisamos el mecanismo de extracción de ganancias veraz ProfitExtractr. Este mecanismo es un caso especial de un esquema general de costos compartidos debido a Moulin y Shenker [11]. El objetivo de la extracción de ganancias es, dadas las ofertas B, extraer un valor objetivo R de ganancias de algún subconjunto de los postores. ProfitExTractr: dadas las ofertas B, encuentre la K más grande de tal manera que los licitadores K más altos puedan compartir igualmente el costo R. Cargar a cada uno de estos licitadores r/k. Si ningún subconjunto de postores puede cubrir el costo, el mecanismo no tiene ganadores. Las propiedades importantes de esta subasta son las siguientes: • ProfitExtractr es sincero.• Si r ≤ f (b), ProfitExtractr (b) = r;De lo contrario, no tiene ganadores ni ingresos. Utilizaremos este mecanismo de extracción de ganancias en la Sección 5 con la siguiente intuición. Tal extractor de ganancias permite tratar este subconjunto de licitadores como una sola oferta con valor F (s). Tenga en cuenta que, dada una sola oferta, b, un mecanismo veraz podría ofrecerle el precio t y si t ≤ b, entonces el licitador gana y paga t;De lo contrario, el postor no paga nada (y pierde). Del mismo modo, un mecanismo puede ofrecer el conjunto de postores un ingreso objetivo R. Si r ≤ f (2) (s), entonces ProfitExtractr plantea R de S;De lo contrario, no aumenta los ingresos de S. 3. Una subasta óptima para tres postores en esta sección definimos la subasta óptima para tres postores, υ3, y demostramos que de hecho coincide con el límite inferior conocido de 13/6. Seguimos la definición y la prueba con una discusión sobre cómo se derivó esta subasta. Definición 5. Υ3 es invariante a escala y simétrica y dada por la función independiente de BID con función de densidad ρ1, x (z) = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩≤ 3/2 1 con probabilidad 9/13 z con densidad de probabilidad G (z) para z> 3/2 para x> 3/2⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 1 con probabilidad 9/13 - x 3/2 zg (z)Dz x con probabilidad x 3/2 (z + 1) g (z) dz z con densidad de probabilidad G (z) para z> x donde g (x) = 2/13 (x - 1) 3. Teorema 3. La subasta υ3 tiene una relación competitiva de 13/6 ≈ 2.17, que es óptima. Además, la subasta aumenta exactamente 6 13 F (2) en cada entrada con ofertas no idénticas. PRUEBA. Considere las ofertas 1, x, y, con 1 <x <y. Hay tres casos. Caso 1 (x <y ≤ 3/2): F (2) = 3. La subasta debe aumentar los ingresos esperados de al menos 18/13 en estas ofertas. El postor con valoración x pagará 1 con 9/13, y el postor con valoración y pagará 1 con probabilidad 9/13. Por lo tanto, υ3 aumenta 18/13 en estas ofertas. Caso 2 (x ≤ 3/2 <y): F (2) = 3. La subasta debe aumentar los ingresos esperados de al menos 18/13 en estas ofertas. El postor con 177 valoración x pagará 9/13 - y 3/2 zg (z) dz en expectativa. El postor con valoración y pagará 9/13 + y 3/2 zg (z) dz en expectativa. Por lo tanto, υ3 aumenta 18/13 en estas ofertas. Caso 3 (3/2 <x ≤ y): f (2) = 2x. La subasta debe aumentar los ingresos esperados de al menos 12x/13 en estas ofertas. Considere los ingresos recaudados de los tres postores: E [υ3 (b)] = P (1, x, y) + P (x, 1, y) + p (y, 1, x) = 0 + 9/13 -y 3/2 ZG (Z) DZ + 9/13 - x 3/2 ZG (Z) DZ + X X 3/2 (Z + 1) G (Z) DZ + Y x ZG (Z) DZ = 18/13 +(x - 2) x 3/2 zg (z) dz + x x 3/2 g (z) dz = 12x/13. La ecuación final proviene de sustituir en g (x) = 2/13 (x - 1) 3 y expandir las integrales. Tenga en cuenta que la fracción de F (2) planteada en cada entrada es idéntica. Si alguna de las desigualdades 1 ≤ x ≤ y no es estricta, la misma prueba se aplica dando un límite inferior en las ganancias de las subastas;Sin embargo, este límite ya no puede ser apretado. Motivación para υ3 En esta sección, conjeturaremos que una distribución de entrada particular es el peor de los casos y mostraremos, como consecuencia, que todas las entradas son peores casos en la subasta óptima. Al aplicar esta consecuencia, obtendremos una subasta óptima para tres postores. Una subasta aleatoria y aleatoria en n licitantes puede representarse mediante una función aleatoria F: RN - 1 × N → R que mapea los vectores de oferta enmascarados a los precios en R. Por normalización, podemos suponer que la oferta más baja posible es 1. Recuerde que ρb-i (z) = pr [f (b-i) = z]. La subasta óptima para el problema de la subasta finita se puede encontrar mediante el siguiente problema de optimización en el que las variables son ρb-i (z): maximice r sujeto a n i = 1 bi z = 1 zρb-i (z) dz ≥ rf (2 (2) (b) ∞ z = 1 ρb-i (z) dz = 1 ρb-i (z) ≥ 0 Este conjunto de desigualdades integrales es difícil de maximizar. Sin embargo, al adivinar qué restricciones son ajustadas y cuáles son flojos en lo óptimo, podremos obtener un conjunto de ecuaciones diferenciales para las cuales cualquier solución factible es una subasta óptima. Como discutimos en la Sección 2.4, en [8], los autores definen una distribución y la usan para encontrar un límite más bajo en la relación competitiva de la subasta óptima. Para dos postores, esta distribución de ofertas es la distribución de entrada en el peor de los casos. Suponemos (y luego verificamos) que esta distribución es la distribución de entrada en el peor de los casos para tres postores también. Dado que esta distribución tiene un soporte total sobre el conjunto de todos los vectores de ofertas y la distribución del peor de los casos pone una probabilidad positiva solo en las entradas en el peor de los casos, por lo tanto, podemos suponer que todos los conjuntos de entradas, excepto una medida cero, es el peor de los casos para la subasta óptima. En la subasta óptima de dos veces, todas las entradas con ofertas no idénticas son el peor de los casos, por lo que asumiremos lo mismo para tres licitadores. La suposición de que estas restricciones son estrechas nos permite transformar el problema de optimización en un problema de viabilidad limitado por ecuaciones diferenciales. Si la solución a estas ecuaciones tiene un valor que coincide con el límite inferior obtenido de la distribución del peor de los casos, entonces esta solución es la subasta óptima y que nuestra elección conjeturada de la distribución del peor de los casos es correcta. En la Sección 6 mostramos que la subasta óptima a veces debe colocar la masa de probabilidad en los precios de venta por encima de la oferta más alta. Esto motiva a considerar subastas de invariantes de escala simétrica para tres postores con función de densidad de probabilidad, ρ1, x (z), de la siguiente forma: ρ1, x (z) = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 1 con probabilidad discreta a (x) x conProbabilidad discreta B (x) z Con densidad de probabilidad G (z) para z> x En esta subasta, el precio de venta para el primer postor es una de las dos últimas ofertas, o más que cualquier oferta con una densidad de probabilidad que es independientede la entrada. El problema de viabilidad que surge del problema de optimización lineal al suponer que las restricciones son ajustadas es el siguiente: a (y) + a (x) + xb (x) + y x zg (z) dz = r max (3, 2x) ∀x <y a (x) + b (x) + ∞ x g (z) dz = 1 a (x) ≥ 0 b (x) ≥ 0 g (z) ≥ 0 Resolver este problema de viabilidad da la subasta υ3 propuesta anteriormente. La prueba de su optimización valida su forma propuesta. Encontrar una restricción simple en la forma de subastas de N-Bidder para N> 3 bajo las cuales la subasta óptima se puede encontrar analíticamente como anteriormente sigue siendo un problema abierto.4. Los puntos de referencia de ganancias generalizadas En esta sección, ampliamos nuestro enfoque más allá de las subastas que compiten con F (2) para considerar otros puntos de referencia para una ganancia de subastas. Mostraremos que, para tres postores, la forma de la subasta óptima es esencialmente independiente de la ganancia de referencia utilizada. Estos resultados corrobora fuertemente el análisis competitivo de las subastas en el peor de los casos al mostrar que nuestras técnicas nos permiten obtener subastas que son competitivas contra una amplia variedad de puntos de referencia razonables en lugar de simplemente F (2). El trabajo previo en el análisis competitivo de las subastas se ha centrado en la cuestión de diseñar la subasta con la mejor relación competitiva contra F (2), la ganancia del mecanismo omnisciente omnisciente omnisciente que vende al menos dos artículos. Sin embargo, es razonable considerar otros puntos de referencia. Por ejemplo, uno podría desear competir contra V ∗, la ganancia de la subasta de K-Vickrey con una opción óptima de la visión de K.2, alternativamente, si se usa una subasta como subrutina en un mecanismo más grande, uno podría desear elegirLa subasta que es óptimamente competitiva con un punto de referencia específico para ese propósito. Recuerde que F (2) (b) = max2≥k≥n kb (k). Podemos generalizar esta definición a GS, parametrizado por S = (S2, ..., Sn) y definidos como: GS (B) = MAX 2≤K≤N SKB (K). Al considerar GS, asumimos sin pérdida de generalidad que Si <Si+1, de lo contrario, la restricción impuesta por Si+1 es irrelevante. Tenga en cuenta que F (2) es el caso especial de GS con Si = I, y que V ∗ = GS con Si = I-1. 2 Recuerda que la subasta K-Vickrey vende una unidad a cada uno de los BDers más altos en unPrecio igual a la primera oferta más alta, B (K+1), logrando una ganancia de KB (K+1).178 Compitiendo con GS ahora diseñaremos una subasta de tres traseros υs, t 3 que logra la relación competitiva óptima contra GS, t. Como antes, primero encontraremos un límite inferior en la relación competitiva y luego diseñaremos una subasta para cumplir con ese límite. Podemos reducir la relación competitiva de υS, t 3 usando la misma distribución en el peor de los casos de [8] que usamos contra F (2). Evaluar el rendimiento de cualquier subasta que compita contra GS, T en esta distribución generará el siguiente teorema. Denotamos la subasta óptima para tres postores contra GS, T como υS, T 3. Teorema 4. La subasta óptima de tres traseros, υS, T 3, que compite contra GS, T (B) = Max (SB (2), TB (3)) tiene una relación competitiva de al menos S2 +T2 2T. La prueba se puede encontrar en el apéndice. Del mismo modo, podemos encontrar la subasta óptima contra GS, t usando la misma técnica que utilizamos para resolver la subasta de tres postor con la mejor relación competitiva contra F (2). Definición 6. ΥS, t 3 es invariante y simétrica a escala y dada por la función independiente de BID con función de densidad ρ1, x (z) = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨⎩ para x ≤ t s 1 con probabilidad T2 S2+T2 Z con densidad de probabilidad G (z) para z> t s para x> t s⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ 1 con probabilidad t2 s2+t2 - x t s zg (z) dz xcon probabilidad x t s (z + 1) g (z) dz z con densidad de probabilidad g (z) para z> x donde g (x) = 2 (t - s) 2 /(s2 + t2) (x - 1) 3. Teorema 5. ΥS, T 3 es S2 +T2 2T -Competitivo con GS, T. Esta subasta, como υ3, puede derivarse reduciendo el problema de optimización a un problema de viabilidad, adivinando que la solución óptima tiene la misma forma que υS, T 3 y la resolución. La subasta es óptima porque coincide con el límite inferior que se encuentra arriba. Tenga en cuenta que la forma de υS, T 3 es esencialmente la misma que para υ3, pero que la probabilidad de cada precio se escala dependiendo de los valores de S y T.Que nuestra subasta para tres postores coincida con el límite inferior calculado por la distribución de entrada utilizada en [8] es una fuerte evidencia de que esta distribución de entrada es la distribución de entrada en el peor de los casos para cualquier número de licitadores y cualquier punto de referencia de ganancias generalizada. Además, sospechamos fuertemente que para cualquier número de postores, la forma de la subasta óptima será independiente del punto de referencia utilizado.5. Subastas de agregación Hemos visto que las subastas óptimas para casos pequeños del modelo de suministro limitado se pueden encontrar analíticamente. En esta sección, construiremos un esquema para convertir las subastas de suministro limitadas en subastas de suministro ilimitadas con una buena relación competitiva. Como se discutió en la Sección 2.5, la existencia de un extractor de ganancias, ProfitExtractr, permite que una subasta trate un conjunto de ofertas como una sola oferta con valor F (s). Dado que los postores y una subasta, AM, para M <n licitadores, podemos convertir la subasta de trasfieto en una subasta de Bidor N mediante la división aleatoria de los licitadores en subconjuntos y luego tratando cada subconjunto como un solo postor (a través de ProfitExtracttr)y ejecutando la subasta M-Bidder. Definición 7. Dada una subasta veraz de Bidder M, AM, la subasta de la agregación M para AM, Aggam, funciona de la siguiente manera: 1. Elegir cada oferta de manera uniforme al azar en uno de los contenedores M, lo que resulta en vectores de oferta B (1) ,..., B (M).2. Para cada bin j, calcule la oferta agregada bj = f (b (j)). Sea B el vector de las ofertas agregadas, y B - J sean las ofertas agregadas para todos los contenedores que no sean j.3. Calcule el precio agregado TJ = F (B-J), donde F es la función independiente de la oferta para AM.4. Para cada bin j, ejecute ProfitExtracttj en B (j). Dado que AM y ProfitExtractr son sinceros, TJ se calcula independientemente de cualquier oferta en Bin J y, por lo tanto, el precio ofrecido cualquier postor en B (j) es independiente de su oferta;Por lo tanto, el teorema 6. Si AM es sincero, la subasta de la agregación M para AM, Aggam, es sincera. Tenga en cuenta que este esquema produce una nueva forma de comprender la subasta de extracción de ganancias de muestreo aleatorio (RSPE) [5] como el caso más simple de una subasta de agregación. Es la subasta de 2 de agregación para υ2, la subasta Vickrey de 1 unidad. Para analizar Aggam, considere arrojar k bolas a contenedores etiquetados m. Deje que K represente una configuración de bolas en los contenedores, de modo que Ki es igual al número de bolas en el contenedor I, y K (i) es igual al número de bolas en el contenedor ésimo más grande. Deje que KM, K representen el conjunto de todas las configuraciones posibles de K Balls en los contenedores M. Escribimos el coeficiente multinomial de K como K k. La probabilidad de que una configuración particular K surja arrojando bolas a los contenedores de manera uniforme al azar es K K M - K. Teorema 7. Sea una subasta con relación competitiva β. Luego, la subasta de agregación M para AM, Aggam, aumenta la siguiente fracción de los ingresos óptimos F (2) (b): E Aggam (b) F (2) ≥ min k≥2 k∈Km, k f (2)(K) Prueba de K K βKMK. Por definición, F (2) se vende a K ≥ 2 licitadores a un solo precio p.Deje que KJ sea el número de tales postores en B (J). Claramente, F (B (J)) ≥ PKJ. Por lo tanto, F (2) (F (B (1)), ..., F (B (N))) F (2) (B) ≥ F (2) (Pk1, ..., Pkn) Pk =F (2) (K1, ..., Kn) k La desigualdad se deriva de la monotonicidad de F (2), y la igualdad de la homogeneidad de F (2). ProfitExtractTj aumentará TJ si TJ ≤ BJ, y no hay ganancias de lo contrario. Esto, un Assam (B) ≥ E D (2) (B)/β. El teorema sigue reescribiendo esta expectativa como una suma sobre todos los k en km, k.5.1 Una subasta competitiva 3.25 Aplicamos el esquema de subasta de agregación a υ3, nuestra subasta óptima para tres postores, para lograr una subasta con la relación competitiva 3.25. Esto mejora en la subasta previamente más conocida que es 3.39 competitiva [7]. Teorema 8. La subasta de agregación para υ3 tiene una relación competitiva 3.25.179 Prueba. Por el Teorema 7, E Aggυ3 (b) F (2) (b) ≥ min k≥2 k i = 1 k - i j = 1 f (2) (i, j, k - i - j) k i, j, k−I - J βK3K para K = 2 y K = 3, E Aggυ3 (b) = 2 3 K/β. A medida que K aumenta, E Aggυ3 (b) /F (2) también aumenta. Como no esperamos encontrar una fórmula de forma cerrada para los ingresos, bajamos el límite F (2) (b) por 3B (3). Usando grandes límites de desviación, se puede demostrar que este límite inferior es mayor que 2 3 K/β para K para lo suficiente, y el resto puede mostrarse mediante cálculo explícito. Conectando β = 13/6, la relación competitiva es 13/4. A medida que K aumenta, la relación competitiva se acerca a 13/6. Tenga en cuenta que lo anterior limita en la relación competitiva de Aggυ3 es apretada. Para ver esto, considere el vector de ofertas con dos ofertas muy grandes y no idénticas de H y H + con las ofertas restantes 1. Dado que la relación competitiva de υ3 es ajustada en este ejemplo, los ingresos esperados de esta subasta en esta entrada serán exactamente 13/4.5.2 Una subasta de agregación basada en GS, T en esta sección mostramos que υ3 no es la subasta óptima para usar en una subasta de agregación. Uno puede hacerlo mejor eligiendo la subasta que es óptimamente competitiva contra un punto de referencia especialmente personalizado. Para ver por qué este podría ser el caso, observe (Tabla 1) que la fracción de F (2) (b) planteada para cuando hay K = 2 y K = 3 licitadores ganadores en F (2) (b) es sustancialmente más pequeño.que la fracción de F (2) (b) planteada cuando hay más ganadores. Esto ocurre porque la relación esperada entre F (2) (B) y F (2) (B) es más baja en este caso, mientras que la relación competitiva de υ3 es constante. Si elegimos una subasta de tres postor que funcionó mejor cuando F (2) tiene un número menor de ganadores, nuestra subasta de agregación funcionaría mejor en el peor de los casos. Un enfoque es competir contra un punto de referencia diferente que pone más peso que F (2) en soluciones con un pequeño número de ganadores. Recuerde que F (2) es la instancia de GS, T con S = 2 y T = 3. Al usar la subasta que compite de manera óptima contra GS, T con S> 2, mientras se mantiene t = 3, aumentaremos una mayor fracción de ingresos en un número menor de postores ganadores y una menor fracción de ingresos en un gran número de postores ganadores. Podemos optimizar numéricamente los valores de S y T en GS, T (b) para lograr la mejor relación competitiva para la subasta de agregación. De hecho, esto nos permitirá mejorar nuestra relación competitiva ligeramente. Teorema 9. Para una elección óptima de S y T, la subasta de agregación para υS, T 3 es 3.243 competitiva. La prueba sigue el esquema del teorema 7 y 8 con la elección óptima de S = 2.162 (mientras que T se mantiene constante en 3).5.3 Reducir aún más la relación competitiva Hay varias formas en que podríamos intentar usar este esquema de subasta de agregación para continuar impulsando la relación competitiva. En esta sección, damos una breve discusión de varios intentos.5.3.1 Aggυm para M> 3 Si la subasta de agregación para υ2 tiene una relación competitiva de 4 y la subasta de agregación para υ3 tiene una relación competitiva de 3.25, ¿podemos mejorar la relación competitiva al agregar υ4 o υm para M más grande? Conjeturamos en lo negativo: para M> 3, la subasta de agregación para υM tiene una relación competitiva más grande que la subasta de agregación para υ3. La dificultad principal para probar esto k m = 2 m = 3 m = 4 m = 5 m = 6 m = 7 2 0.25 0.3077 0.3349 0.3508 0.3612 0.3686 3 0.25 0.3077 0.3349 0.3508 0.3612 0.3686 4 0.3125 0.3248 0.3349 0.34383.35512 244 0.33110.3378 0.3439 6 0.3438 0.321 0.3057 0.3056 0.311 0.318 7 0.3438 0.333 0.3081 0.3009 0.3025 0.3074 8 0.3633 0.3229 0.3109 0.3022 0.3002 0.3024 9 0.3633 0.3233 0.3057 0.2977. 28 0.308 0.2952 0.2866 0.2837 11 0.377 0.3319 0.3128 0.298 0.2865 0.2813 12 0.3872 0.3358 0.3105 0.3001 0.28940.2827 13 0.3872 0.3395 0.3092 0.2976 0.2905 0.2841 14 0.3953 0.3391 0.312 0.2961 0.2888 0.2835 15 0.3953 0.3427 0.3135 0.2973 0.2882 0.2825 16 0.44018 3 17 17 0.4018 0.30428 0.3129 0.2.2967 0.2878 0.282 18 0.4073 0.3461 0.3133 0.2959 0.2859 0.2808 19 0.4073 0.3477 0.3137 0.2962 0.2844 0.278920 0.4119 0.3486 0.3148 0.2973 0.2843 0.2777 21 0.4119 0.3506 0.3171 0.298 0.2851 0.2775 22 0.4159 0.3519 0.3189 0.2986 0.2863 0.2781 23 0.4159 0.3531 0.320202 0.2999599599595995 0.2910 0.291 0.2910 0.2910 0.2910 0.2910 0.29129120. 0.3539 0.3209 0.3003 0.2878 0.2797 25 0.4194 0.3548 0.3218 0.3012 0.2886 0.2801 Tabla 1: E A (B)/F (2) (b) Para Aggυm en función de K, el número óptimo de ganadores en F (2) (b). El valor más bajo para cada columna se imprime en negrita.La conjetura radica en la dificultad de encontrar una solución de forma cerrada para la fórmula del Teorema 7. Sin embargo, podemos evaluar esta fórmula numéricamente para diferentes valores de M y K, suponiendo que la relación competitiva para υM coincida con el límite inferior para M dado por el Teorema 2. La Tabla 1 muestra, para cada valor de M y K, la fracción de F (2) planteada por la subasta de agregación para Aggυm cuando hay K licitadores ganadores, suponiendo que el límite inferior del teorema 2 sea apretado.5.3.2 Combinaciones convexas de Aggυm como se puede ver en la Tabla 1, cuando M> 3, el peor valor de K ya no es 2 y 3, sino una función creciente de M.Una subasta de agregación para inar supera a la subasta de agregación para υ3 cuando hay dos o tres postores ganadores, mientras que la subasta de agregación para υ3 supera al otro cuando hay al menos seis postores ganadores. Así, por ejemplo, una subasta que se aleatoriza entre las subastas de agregación para υ3 y υ4 tendrá el peor de los casos que es mejor que la de cualquier subasta sola. Las combinaciones más grandes de subastas permitirán más espacio para optimizar el peor caso. Sin embargo, sospechamos que ninguna combinación convexa de subastas de agregación tendrá una relación competitiva inferior a 3. Además, tenga en cuenta que aún no podemos reclamar la existencia de una buena subasta a través de esta técnica, ya que la subasta óptima υn para n> 3 no se conoce y solo se conjetura que el límite dado por el teorema 2 y representado en la Tabla 1 es correcto para υn.6. Un límite inferior a las subastas conservadoras en esta sección, definimos una clase de subastas que nunca ofrecen un precio de venta que sea más alto que cualquier oferta en la entrada y demostramos un límite más bajo en la relación competitiva de estas subastas. Como este límite inferior 180 es más fuerte que el límite inferior del teorema 2 para n ≥ 3, muestra que la subasta óptima debe cobrar ocasionalmente un precio de venta más alto que cualquier oferta en la entrada. Específicamente, este resultado explica parcialmente la forma de la subasta óptima de tres postor. Definición 8. Decimos que una subasta BIF es conservadora si su función de BidIndependiente F satisface F (B-I) ≤ Max (B-I). Ahora podemos establecer nuestro límite inferior a las subastas conservadoras. Teorema 10. Sea A una subasta conservadora para N postores. Entonces la relación competitiva de A es al menos 3n - 2 n. Corolario 1. La relación competitiva de cualquier subasta conservadora para un número arbitrario de postores es de al menos tres. Para una subasta de dos traseros, esta restricción no evita la optimización. Υ2, la subasta Vickrey de 1 unidad, es conservadora. Sin embargo, para un mayor número de postores, la restricción a las subastas conservadoras afecta la relación competitiva. Para el caso de tres traseros, υ3 tiene una relación competitiva 2.17, mientras que la mejor subasta conservadora no es mejor que 2.33 competitiva. La subasta K-Vickrey y la subasta de precios óptimas de muestreo aleatorio [9] son subastas conservadoras. La subasta de extracción de ganancias de muestreo aleatorio [5] y la subasta central [7], por otro lado, usan el mecanismo ProfitExTractr como subrutina y, por lo tanto, a veces ofrecen un precio de venta que es más alto que el valor de oferta de entrada más alto. En [8], los autores definen una subasta restringida como una sobre la cual, para cualquier entrada, los precios de venta se obtienen del conjunto de valores de oferta de entrada. La clase de subastas conservadoras puede verse como una generalización de la clase de subastas restringidas y, por lo tanto, nuestro resultado a continuación da límites más bajos en el rendimiento de una clase más amplia de subastas. Probaremos el Teorema 10 con la ayuda del siguiente lema: Lemma 1. Sea A una subasta conservadora con la relación competitiva 1/R para N Borders. Sea h n.Deje H0 = 1 y HK = kh de lo contrario. Luego, para todos K y H ≥ kh, PR [F (1, 1, ..., 1, H) ≤ HK] ≥ Nr - 1 N - 1 + K (3NR - 2R - N N - 1). PRUEBA. El lema está demostrado por una fuerte inducción en k.Primero alguna notación que será conveniente. Para cualquier K y H en particular consideraremos el vector de oferta B = (1, ..., 1, HK, H) y colocamos límites en ρb-i (z). Dado que podemos suponer sin pérdida de generalidad que la subasta es simétrica, notaremos B-1 como B con cualquiera de las ofertas de 1 valor enmascaradas. Del mismo modo, notamos B-HK (Resp. B-H) como B con la BID de valor HK (resp. Oferta de valor H) enmascarado. También dejaremos que P1 (b), phk (b) y pH (b) representen el pago esperado de un postor de 1 valorado, valioso y valorado en H en A, respectivamente (nota por simetría la esperada.El pago para todos los licitadores de 1 valor es el mismo). Caso base (k = 0, HK = 1): A debe aumentar los ingresos de al menos RN en B = (1, ..., 1, 1, H): Rn ≤ pH (B) + (N - 1) P1(b) = 1 + (n-1) 1 0 xρb-1 (x) dx ≤ 1 + (n-1) 1 0 ρb-1 (x) dx La segunda desigualdad se deriva del conservadurismo de la subasta subyacente. El caso base sigue trivialmente desde la desigualdad final. Caso inductivo (k> 0, HK = kh): Sea B = (1, ..., 1, HK, H). Primero, encontraremos un límite superior en pH (b) pH (b) = 1 0 xρb-h (x) dx + k i = 1 HI HI-1 xρb-H (x) dx (1) ≤ 1 + k i =1 HI HI HI-1 ρB-H (X) DX ≤ 1 + 3NR-2R-N N-1 K-1 I = 1 IH + KH 1-NR-1 N-1-(K-1) 3NR-2R-n n - 1 (2) = kh n (1 - r) n - 1 + (k - 1) 2 3nr - 2r - n n - 1 + 1. (3) La ecuación (1) se deriva del conservadurismo de A y (2) es invocar la fuerte hipótesis inductiva con H = kh y la observación de que los ingresos máximos posibles se encontrarán colocando exactamente suficiente probabilidad en cada múltiplo de H para satisfacer las restricciones de la hipótesis inductiva y colocando la probabilidad restante en KH. A continuación, encontraremos un límite inferior en PHK (b) considerando los ingresos recaudados por las ofertas b. Recuerde que debe obtener una ganancia de al menos RF (2) (b) = 2RKH. Dados los límites superiores en la ganancia de la oferta de ecuación con valor H (3), y las ofertas de 1 valorado, la ganancia de la oferta de valor HK debe ser al menos: phk (b) ≥ 2rkh-(n-2) p1 (b) - pH (b) ≥ kh 2r - n (1 - r) n - 1 + (k - 1) 2 3nr - 2r - n n - 1 - o (n).(4) Con el fin de un límite PR [F (B-HK) ≤ kh], considere la subasta que lo minimiza y es consistente con los límites inferiores obtenidos por la fuerte hipótesis inductiva en PR [F (B-HK) ≤ Ih] Para minimizar las restricciones implicadas por la fuerte hipótesis inductiva, colocamos la cantidad mínima de masa de probabilidad requerida cada nivel de precio. Esto da ρhk (b) con probabilidad NR - 1 N - 1 en 1 y exactamente 3NR - 2R - N N - 1 en cada HI por 1 ≤ i <k.Por lo tanto, la ganancia de ofrecer precios en la mayoría de HK - 1 es NR - 1 n - 1 −kh (K - 1) 3NR - 2R - N N - 1. Para satisfacer nuestro límite inferior, (4), en PHK (b), debe poner al menos 3NR - 2R - N N - 1 en HK. Por lo tanto, la probabilidad de que el precio de venta no sea más de kh en el vector de oferta enmascarado en el vector de oferta B = (1, ..., 1, kh, h) debe ser al menos nr - 1 n - 1 + k (3nr−2r - n n - 1). Dado Lemma 1, el Teorema 10 es fácil de probar. PRUEBA. Sea una subasta conservadora. Supongamos 3NR - 2R - N n - 1 => 0. Sea k = 1/, h ≥ kh y h n.Por Lemma 1, PR [f (1, ..., 1, kh, h) ≤ hk] ≥ nr - 1 n - 1 + k> 1. Pero esto es una contradicción, por lo que 3nr - 2r - n n - 1 ≤ 0. Por lo tanto, r ≤ n 3n - 2. El teorema sigue.7. Conclusiones y trabajo futuro hemos encontrado la subasta óptima para el caso de suministro limitado de tres unidades, y demostramos que su estructura es esencialmente independiente del punto de referencia utilizado en su análisis competitivo. Luego hemos utilizado esta subasta para derivar la subasta más conocida para el caso de suministro ilimitado. Nuestro trabajo deja muchas preguntas abiertas interesantes. Descubrimos que el límite inferior de [8] coincide con una subasta para tres postores, 181 incluso cuando compiten contra puntos de referencia generalizados. La pregunta abierta más interesante de nuestro trabajo es si el límite inferior del Teorema 2 puede ser igualado por una subasta para más de tres postores. Conjeturamos que puede. En segundo lugar, consideramos si nuestras técnicas pueden extenderse para encontrar subastas óptimas para un mayor número de postores. El uso de nuestro método de solución analítica requiere el conocimiento de una clase restringida de subastas que es lo suficientemente grande como para contener una subasta óptima pero lo suficientemente pequeña como para que la subasta óptima en esta clase se pueda encontrar explícitamente a través de métodos analíticos. Ninguna clase de subastas que cumplan con estos criterios se conoce incluso por el caso de los cuatro postor. Además, cuando el número de postores es mayor de tres, podría ser el caso de que la subasta óptima no sea expresable en términos de funciones elementales. Otro conjunto interesante de preguntas abiertas se refiere a subastas de agregación. Como mostramos, la subasta de agregación para υ3 supera la subasta de agregación para υ2 y parece que la subasta de agregación para υ3 es mejor que υm para m> 3. Dejamos la verificación de esta conjetura para el trabajo futuro. También mostramos que υ3 no es la mejor subasta de tres traseros para su uso en una subasta de agregación, pero la subasta que lo supera es capaz de reducir la relación competitiva de la subasta general solo un poco. Sería interesante saber si para alguna m hay una subasta de agregación M que mejore sustancialmente en la relación competitiva de Aggυm. Finalmente, comentamos que se sabe muy poco sobre la estructura de la subasta competitiva óptima. En nuestra subasta υ3, el precio de venta de un postor determinado está restringido para ser uno de los otros valores de oferta o ser más alto que todos los demás valores de oferta. La subasta óptima para dos licitadores, la subasta de Vickrey de 1 unidad, también se encuentra dentro de esta clase de subastas, ya que sus precios de venta están restringidos a los valores de oferta. Conjeturamos que una subasta óptima para cualquier número de postores se encuentra dentro de esta clase. Nuestro documento proporciona evidencia parcial de esta conjetura: el límite inferior de la Sección 6 en subastas conservadoras muestra que la subasta óptima debe ofrecer precios de venta más altos que cualquier valor de oferta si el límite inferior del teorema 2 es apretado, como se conjetura. Queda por mostrar que las subastas óptimas de otra manera solo ofrecen precios de venta a valores de oferta.8.

Prueba del Teorema 4 Deseamos demostrar que υS, T 3, la subasta óptima para tres postores contra GS, T, tiene una relación competitiva al menos S2 +T2 2T. Nuestra prueba sigue el esquema de la prueba de Lemma 5 y el Teorema 1 de [8];Sin embargo, nuestro caso es más simple porque solo buscamos un límite cuando n = 3. Defina el vector de BID aleatorio B = (B1, B2, B3) con PR [Bi> Z] = 1/Z. Calculamos EB [GS, T (B)] integrando PR [GS, T (B)> Z]. Luego usamos el hecho de que ninguna subasta puede haber esperado ganancias superiores a 3 en B para encontrar un límite más bajo en la relación competitiva contra GS, T para cualquier subasta. Para la distribución de entrada B definida anteriormente, Sea B (i) la oferta más grande. Defina los eventos disjuntos H2 = B (2) ≥ Z/S ∧ B (3) <Z/T, y H3 = B (3) ≥ Z/T. Intuitivamente, H3 corresponde al evento de que los tres postores ganan en GS, T, mientras que H2 corresponde al evento que solo los dos mejores postores ganan. GS, T (B) será mayor que Z si ocurre cualquier evento: PR [GS, T (B)> Z] = PR [H2] + PR [H3] (5) = 3 S Z 2 1 - T Z + T Z 3 3(6) Usando la identidad definida para variables aleatorias continuas no negativas que e [x] = ∞ 0 pr [x> x] dx, tenemos eB [gs, t (b)] = t + ∞ t 3 s z 2 1- t z + t z 3 dz (7) = 3 s2 + t2 2t (8) Dado que, para cualquier subasta a, eb [ea [a (b)]] ≤ 3 [8], está claro que EB [GS,t (b)] eb [ea [a (b)]] ≥ s2 +t2 2t. Por lo tanto, existe alguna entrada B para cada subasta A tal que GS, T (B) EA [A (B)] ≥ S2+T2 2T.182",

        "This is without loss of generality as (a) any lower bound that applies to the n = case also extends to the case where n ≥ [8], and (b) there is a reduction from the unlimited supply auction problem to the limited supply auction problem that takes an unlimited supply auction that is β-competitive with F(2) and constructs a limited supply auction parameterized by that is β-competitive with F(2, ) , the optimal omniscient auction that sells between 2 and units [6].",
        "Henceforth, we will assume that we are in the unlimited supply case, and we will examine lower bounds for limited supply problems by placing a restriction on the number of bidders in the auction. 2.4 Lower Bounds and Optimal Auctions Frequently in this paper, we will refer to the best known lower bound on the competitive ratio of truthful auctions: THEOREM 2.

        "We conjecture that it can.",
        "Second, we consider whether our techniques can be extended to find optimal auctions for greater numbers of bidders.",
        "The use of our analytic solution method requires knowledge of a restricted class of auctions which is large enough to contain an optimal auction but small enough that the optimal auction in this class can be found explicitly through analytic methods.",
        "No class of auctions which meets these criteria is known even for the four bidder case.",
        "Also, when the number of bidders is greater than three, it might be the case that the optimal auction is not expressible in terms of elementary functions.",
        "Another interesting set of open questions concerns aggregation auctions.",
        "As we show, the aggregation auction for Υ3 outperforms the aggregation auction for Υ2 and it appears that the aggregation auction for Υ3 is better than Υm for m > 3.",
        "We leave verification of this conjecture for future work.",

        "It would be interesting to know whether for any m there is an m-aggregation auction that substantially improves on the competitive ratio of AggΥm .",
        "Finally, we remark that very little is known about the structure of the optimal competitive auction.",
        "In our auction Υ3, the sales price for a given bidder is restricted either to be one of the other bid values or to be higher than all other bid values.",
        "The optimal auction for two bidders, the 1-unit Vickrey auction, also falls within this class of auctions, as its sales prices are restricted to bid values.",
        "We conjecture that an optimal auction for any number of bidders lies within this class.",
        "Our paper provides partial evidence for this conjecture: the lower bound of Section 6 on conservative auctions shows that the optimal auction must offer sales prices higher than any bid value if the lower bound of Theorem 2 is tight, as is conjectured.",

                "Here, the classical approach is to design such a mechanism given the prior distribution from which the bidders preferences are drawn (See e.g., [12, 4]).",

                "The goal of such work is to design an auction that achieves a large constant fraction of the profit attainable by an optimal mechanism that knows the prior distribution in advance.",
                "Positive results in this direction are fueled by the observation that in auctions for a number of identical units, much of the distribution from which the bidders are drawn can be deduced on the fly by the auction as it is being run [9, 14, 2].",
                "The performance of an auction in such a worst-case <br>competitive analysis</br> is measured by its competitive ratio, the ratio between a benchmark performance and the auctions performance on the input distribution that maximizes this ratio.",

                "We refer to auctions derived from this framework as aggregation auctions (Section 5). • We improve on the best known competitive ratio by proving that the aggregation auction constructed from our optimal three-unit auction is 3.25-competitive (Section 5.1). • Assuming that the conjecture that the optimal -unit auction has a competitive ratio that matches the lower bound proved in [8], we show that this optimal auction for ≥ 3 on some inputs will occasionally offer prices that are higher than any bid in that input (Section 6).",

                "We will use this profit extraction mechanism in Section 5 with the following intuition.",
                "Such a profit extractor makes it possible to treat this subset of bidders as a single bid with value F(S).",
                "Note that given a single bid, b, a truthful mechanism might offer it price t and if t ≤ b then the bidder wins and pays t; otherwise the bidder pays nothing (and loses).",
                "Likewise, a mechanism can offer the set of bidders S a target revenue R. If R ≤ F(2) (S), then ProfitExtractR raises R from S; otherwise, the it raises no revenue from S. 3.",
