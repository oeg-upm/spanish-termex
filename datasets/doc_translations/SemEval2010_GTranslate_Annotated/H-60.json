We show that an intuitive idf -based probability function for the probability of a term being informative assumes disjoint document events. By assuming documents to be independent rather than disjoint, we arrive at a Poisson-based probability of being informative. The framework is useful for understanding and deciding the parameter estimation and combination in probabilistic retrieval models. Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models General Terms Theory 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND The inverse document frequency (idf ) is one of the most successful parameters for a relevance-based ranking of retrieved objects. With N being the total number of documents, and n(t) being the number of documents in which term t occurs, the idf is defined as follows: idf(t) := − log n(t) N , 0 <= idf(t) < ∞ Ranking based on the sum of the idf -values of the query terms that occur in the retrieved documents works well, this has been shown in numerous applications. Also, it is well known that the combination of a document-specific term weight and idf works better than idf alone. This approach is known as tf-idf , where tf(t, d) (0 <= tf(t, d) <= 1) is the so-called term frequency of term t in document d. The idf reflects the discriminating power (informativeness) of a term, whereas the tf reflects the occurrence of a term. The idf alone works better than the tf alone does. An explanation might be the problem of tf with terms that occur in many documents; let us refer to those terms as noisy terms. We use the notion of noisy terms rather than frequent terms since frequent terms leaves open whether we refer to the document frequency of a term in a collection or to the so-called term frequency (also referred to as withindocument frequency) of a term in a document. We associate noise with the document frequency of a term in a collection, and we associate occurrence with the withindocument frequency of a term. The tf of a noisy term might be high in a document, but noisy terms are not good candidates for representing a document. Therefore, the removal of noisy terms (known as stopword removal) is essential when applying tf . In a tf-idf approach, the removal of stopwords is conceptually obsolete, if stopwords are just words with a low idf . From a probabilistic point of view, tf is a value with a frequency-based probabilistic interpretation whereas idf has an informative rather than a probabilistic interpretation. The missing probabilistic interpretation of idf is a problem in probabilistic retrieval models where we combine uncertain knowledge of different dimensions (e.g.: informativeness of terms, structure of documents, quality of documents, age of documents, etc.) such that a good estimate of the probability of relevance is achieved. An intuitive solution is a normalisation of idf such that we obtain values in the interval [0; 1]. For example, consider a normalisation based on the maximal idf -value. Let T be the set of terms occurring in a collection. Pfreq (t is informative) := idf(t) maxidf maxidf := max({idf(t)|t ∈ T}), maxidf <= − log(1/N) minidf := min({idf(t)|t ∈ T}), minidf >= 0 minidf maxidf ≤ Pfreq (t is informative) ≤ 1.0 This frequency-based probability function covers the interval [0; 1] if the minimal idf is equal to zero, which is the case if we have at least one term that occurs in all documents. Can we interpret Pfreq , the normalised idf , as the probability that the term is informative? When investigating the probabilistic interpretation of the 227 normalised idf , we made several observations related to disjointness and independence of document events. These observations are reported in section 3. We show in section 3.1 that the frequency-based noise probability n(t) N used in the classic idf -definition can be explained by three assumptions: binary term occurrence, constant document containment and disjointness of document containment events. In section 3.2 we show that by assuming independence of documents, we obtain 1 − e−1 ≈ 1 − 0.37 as the upper bound of the noise probability of a term. The value e−1 is related to the logarithm and we investigate in section 3.3 the link to information theory. In section 4, we link the results of the previous sections to probability theory. We show the steps from possible worlds to binomial distribution and Poisson distribution. In section 5, we emphasise that the theoretical framework of this paper is applicable for both idf and tf . Finally, in section 6, we base the definition of the probability of being informative on the results of the previous sections and compare frequency-based and Poisson-based definitions. 2. BACKGROUND The relationship between frequencies, probabilities and information theory (entropy) has been the focus of many researchers. In this background section, we focus on work that investigates the application of the Poisson distribution in IR since a main part of the work presented in this paper addresses the underlying assumptions of Poisson. [4] proposes a 2-Poisson model that takes into account the different nature of relevant and non-relevant documents, rare terms (content words) and frequent terms (noisy terms, function words, stopwords). [9] shows experimentally that most of the terms (words) in a collection are distributed according to a low dimension n-Poisson model. [10] uses a 2-Poisson model for including term frequency-based probabilities in the probabilistic retrieval model. The non-linear scaling of the Poisson function showed significant improvement compared to a linear frequency-based probability. The Poisson model was here applied to the term frequency of a term in a document. We will generalise the discussion by pointing out that document frequency and term frequency are dual parameters in the collection space and the document space, respectively. Our discussion of the Poisson distribution focuses on the document frequency in a collection rather than on the term frequency in a document. [7] and [6] address the deviation of idf and Poisson, and apply Poisson mixtures to achieve better Poisson-based estimates. The results proved again experimentally that a onedimensional Poisson does not work for rare terms, therefore Poisson mixtures and additional parameters are proposed. [3], section 3.3, illustrates and summarises comprehensively the relationships between frequencies, probabilities and Poisson. Different definitions of idf are put into context and a notion of noise is defined, where noise is viewed as the complement of idf . We use in our paper a different notion of noise: we consider a frequency-based noise that corresponds to the document frequency, and we consider a term noise that is based on the independence of document events. [11], [12], [8] and [1] link frequencies and probability estimation to information theory. [12] establishes a framework in which information retrieval models are formalised based on probabilistic inference. A key component is the use of a space of disjoint events, where the framework mainly uses terms as disjoint events. The probability of being informative defined in our paper can be viewed as the probability of the disjoint terms in the term space of [12]. [8] address entropy and bibliometric distributions. Entropy is maximal if all events are equiprobable and the frequency-based Lotka law (N/iλ is the number of scientists that have written i publications, where N and λ are distribution parameters), Zipf and the Pareto distribution are related. The Pareto distribution is the continuous case of the Lotka and Lotka and Zipf show equivalences. The Pareto distribution is used by [2] for term frequency normalisation. The Pareto distribution compares to the Poisson distribution in the sense that Pareto is fat-tailed, i. e. Pareto assigns larger probabilities to large numbers of events than Poisson distributions do. This makes Pareto interesting since Poisson is felt to be too radical on frequent events. We restrict in this paper to the discussion of Poisson, however, our results show that indeed a smoother distribution than Poisson promises to be a good candidate for improving the estimation of probabilities in information retrieval. [1] establishes a theoretical link between tf-idf and information theory and the theoretical research on the meaning of tf-idf clarifies the statistical model on which the different measures are commonly based. This motivation matches the motivation of our paper: We investigate theoretically the assumptions of classical idf and Poisson for a better understanding of parameter estimation and combination. 3. FROM DISJOINT TO INDEPENDENT We define and discuss in this section three probabilities: The frequency-based noise probability (definition 1), the total noise probability for disjoint documents (definition 2). and the noise probability for independent documents (definition 3). 3.1 Binary occurrence, constant containment and disjointness of documents We show in this section, that the frequency-based noise probability n(t) N in the idf definition can be explained as a total probability with binary term occurrence, constant document containment and disjointness of document containments. We refer to a probability function as binary if for all events the probability is either 1.0 or 0.0. The occurrence probability P(t|d) is binary, if P(t|d) is equal to 1.0 if t ∈ d, and P(t|d) is equal to 0.0, otherwise. P(t|d) is binary : ⇐⇒ P(t|d) = 1.0 ∨ P(t|d) = 0.0 We refer to a probability function as constant if for all events the probability is equal. The document containment probability reflect the chance that a document occurs in a collection. This containment probability is constant if we have no information about the document containment or we ignore that documents differ in containment. Containment could be derived, for example, from the size, quality, age, links, etc. of a document. For a constant containment in a collection with N documents, 1 N is often assumed as the containment probability. We generalise this definition and introduce the constant λ where 0 ≤ λ ≤ N. The containment of a document d depends on the collection c, this is reflected by the notation P(d|c) used for the containment 228 of a document. P(d|c) is constant : ⇐⇒ ∀d : P(d|c) = λ N For disjoint documents that cover the whole event space, we set λ = 1 and obtain Èd P(d|c) = 1.0. Next, we define the frequency-based noise probability and the total noise probability for disjoint documents. We introduce the event notation t is noisy and t occurs for making the difference between the noise probability P(t is noisy|c) in a collection and the occurrence probability P(t occurs|d) in a document more explicit, thereby keeping in mind that the noise probability corresponds to the occurrence probability of a term in a collection. Definition 1. The frequency-based term noise probability: Pfreq (t is noisy|c) := n(t) N Definition 2. The total term noise probability for disjoint documents: Pdis (t is noisy|c) := d P(t occurs|d) · P(d|c) Now, we can formulate a theorem that makes assumptions explicit that explain the classical idf . Theorem 1. IDF assumptions: If the occurrence probability P(t|d) of term t over documents d is binary, and the containment probability P(d|c) of documents d is constant, and document containments are disjoint events, then the noise probability for disjoint documents is equal to the frequency-based noise probability. Pdis (t is noisy|c) = Pfreq (t is noisy|c) Proof. The assumptions are: ∀d : (P(t occurs|d) = 1 ∨ P(t occurs|d) = 0) ∧ P(d|c) = λ N ∧ d P(d|c) = 1.0 We obtain: Pdis (t is noisy|c) = d|t∈d 1 N = n(t) N = Pfreq (t is noisy|c) The above result is not a surprise but it is a mathematical formulation of assumptions that can be used to explain the classical idf . The assumptions make explicit that the different types of term occurrence in documents (frequency of a term, importance of a term, position of a term, document part where the term occurs, etc.) and the different types of document containment (size, quality, age, etc.) are ignored, and document containments are considered as disjoint events. From the assumptions, we can conclude that idf (frequencybased noise, respectively) is a relatively simple but strict estimate. Still, idf works well. This could be explained by a leverage effect that justifies the binary occurrence and constant containment: The term occurrence for small documents tends to be larger than for large documents, whereas the containment for small documents tends to be smaller than for large documents. From that point of view, idf means that P(t ∧ d|c) is constant for all d in which t occurs, and P(t ∧ d|c) is zero otherwise. The occurrence and containment can be term specific. For example, set P(t∧d|c) = 1/ND(c) if t occurs in d, where ND(c) is the number of documents in collection c (we used before just N). We choose a document-dependent occurrence P(t|d) := 1/NT (d), i. e. the occurrence probability is equal to the inverse of NT (d), which is the total number of terms in document d. Next, we choose the containment P(d|c) := NT (d)/NT (c)·NT (c)/ND(c) where NT (d)/NT (c) is a document length normalisation (number of terms in document d divided by the number of terms in collection c), and NT (c)/ND(c) is a constant factor of the collection (number of terms in collection c divided by the number of documents in collection c). We obtain P(t∧d|c) = 1/ND(c). In a tf-idf -retrieval function, the tf -component reflects the occurrence probability of a term in a document. This is a further explanation why we can estimate the idf with a simple P(t|d), since the combined tf-idf contains the occurrence probability. The containment probability corresponds to a document normalisation (document length normalisation, pivoted document length) and is normally attached to the tf -component or the tf-idf -product. The disjointness assumption is typical for frequency-based probabilities. From a probability theory point of view, we can consider documents as disjoint events, in order to achieve a sound theoretical model for explaining the classical idf . But does disjointness reflect the real world where the containment of a document appears to be independent of the containment of another document? In the next section, we replace the disjointness assumption by the independence assumption. 3.2 The upper bound of the noise probability for independent documents For independent documents, we compute the probability of a disjunction as usual, namely as the complement of the probability of the conjunction of the negated events: P(d1 ∨ . . . ∨ dN ) = 1 − P(¬d1 ∧ . . . ∧ ¬dN ) = 1 − d (1 − P(d)) The noise probability can be considered as the conjunction of the term occurrence and the document containment. P(t is noisy|c) := P(t occurs ∧ (d1 ∨ . . . ∨ dN )|c) For disjoint documents, this view of the noise probability led to definition 2. For independent documents, we use now the conjunction of negated events. Definition 3. The term noise probability for independent documents: Pin (t is noisy|c) := d (1 − P(t occurs|d) · P(d|c)) With binary occurrence and a constant containment P(d|c) := λ/N, we obtain the term noise of a term t that occurs in n(t) documents: Pin (t is noisy|c) = 1 − 1 − λ N n(t) 229 For binary occurrence and disjoint documents, the containment probability was 1/N. Now, with independent documents, we can use λ as a collection parameter that controls the average containment probability. We show through the next theorem that the upper bound of the noise probability depends on λ. Theorem 2. The upper bound of being noisy: If the occurrence P(t|d) is binary, and the containment P(d|c) is constant, and document containments are independent events, then 1 − e−λ is the upper bound of the noise probability. ∀t : Pin (t is noisy|c) < 1 − e−λ Proof. The upper bound of the independent noise probability follows from the limit limN→∞(1 + x N )N = ex (see any comprehensive math book, for example, [5], for the convergence equation of the Euler function). With x = −λ, we obtain: lim N→∞ 1 − λ N N = e−λ For the term noise, we have: Pin (t is noisy|c) = 1 − 1 − λ N n(t) Pin (t is noisy|c) is strictly monotonous: The noise of a term tn is less than the noise of a term tn+1, where tn occurs in n documents and tn+1 occurs in n + 1 documents. Therefore, a term with n = N has the largest noise probability. For a collection with infinite many documents, the upper bound of the noise probability for terms tN that occur in all documents becomes: lim N→∞ Pin (tN is noisy) = lim N→∞ 1 − 1 − λ N N = 1 − e−λ By applying an independence rather a disjointness assumption, we obtain the probability e−1 that a term is not noisy even if the term does occur in all documents. In the disjoint case, the noise probability is one for a term that occurs in all documents. If we view P(d|c) := λ/N as the average containment, then λ is large for a term that occurs mostly in large documents, and λ is small for a term that occurs mostly in small documents. Thus, the noise of a term t is large if t occurs in n(t) large documents and the noise is smaller if t occurs in small documents. Alternatively, we can assume a constant containment and a term-dependent occurrence. If we assume P(d|c) := 1, then P(t|d) := λ/N can be interpreted as the average probability that t represents a document. The common assumption is that the average containment or occurrence probability is proportional to n(t). However, here is additional potential: The statistical laws (see [3] on Luhn and Zipf) indicate that the average probability could follow a normal distribution, i. e. small probabilities for small n(t) and large n(t), and larger probabilities for medium n(t). For the monotonous case we investigate here, the noise of a term with n(t) = 1 is equal to 1 − (1 − λ/N) = λ/N and the noise of a term with n(t) = N is close to 1− e−λ . In the next section, we relate the value e−λ to information theory. 3.3 The probability of a maximal informative signal The probability e−1 is special in the sense that a signal with that probability is a signal with maximal information as derived from the entropy definition. Consider the definition of the entropy contribution H(t) of a signal t. H(t) := P(t) · − ln P(t) We form the first derivation for computing the optimum. ∂H(t) ∂P(t) = − ln P(t) + −1 P(t) · P(t) = −(1 + ln P(t)) For obtaining optima, we use: 0 = −(1 + ln P(t)) The entropy contribution H(t) is maximal for P(t) = e−1 . This result does not depend on the base of the logarithm as we see next: ∂H(t) ∂P(t) = − logb P(t) + −1 P(t) · ln b · P(t) = − 1 ln b + logb P(t) = − 1 + ln P(t) ln b We summarise this result in the following theorem: Theorem 3. The probability of a maximal informative signal: The probability Pmax = e−1 ≈ 0.37 is the probability of a maximal informative signal. The entropy of a maximal informative signal is Hmax = e−1 . Proof. The probability and entropy follow from the derivation above. The complement of the maximal noise probability is e−λ and we are looking now for a generalisation of the entropy definition such that e−λ is the probability of a maximal informative signal. We can generalise the entropy definition by computing the integral of λ+ ln P(t), i. e. this derivation is zero for e−λ . We obtain a generalised entropy: −(λ + ln P(t)) d(P(t)) = P(t) · (1 − λ − ln P(t)) The generalised entropy corresponds for λ = 1 to the classical entropy. By moving from disjoint to independent documents, we have established a link between the complement of the noise probability of a term that occurs in all documents and information theory. Next, we link independent documents to probability theory. 4. THE LINK TO PROBABILITY THEORY We review for independent documents three concepts of probability theory: possible worlds, binomial distribution and Poisson distribution. 4.1 Possible Worlds Each conjunction of document events (for each document, we consider two document events: the document can be true or false) is associated with a so-called possible world. For example, consider the eight possible worlds for three documents (N = 3). 230 world w conjunction w7 d1 ∧ d2 ∧ d3 w6 d1 ∧ d2 ∧ ¬d3 w5 d1 ∧ ¬d2 ∧ d3 w4 d1 ∧ ¬d2 ∧ ¬d3 w3 ¬d1 ∧ d2 ∧ d3 w2 ¬d1 ∧ d2 ∧ ¬d3 w1 ¬d1 ∧ ¬d2 ∧ d3 w0 ¬d1 ∧ ¬d2 ∧ ¬d3 With each world w, we associate a probability µ(w), which is equal to the product of the single probabilities of the document events. world w probability µ(w) w7  λ N ¡3 ·  1 − λ N ¡0 w6  λ N ¡2 ·  1 − λ N ¡1 w5  λ N ¡2 ·  1 − λ N ¡1 w4  λ N ¡1 ·  1 − λ N ¡2 w3  λ N ¡2 ·  1 − λ N ¡1 w2  λ N ¡1 ·  1 − λ N ¡2 w1  λ N ¡1 ·  1 − λ N ¡2 w0  λ N ¡0 ·  1 − λ N ¡3 The sum over the possible worlds in which k documents are true and N −k documents are false is equal to the probability function of the binomial distribution, since the binomial coefficient yields the number of possible worlds in which k documents are true. 4.2 Binomial distribution The binomial probability function yields the probability that k of N events are true where each event is true with the single event probability p. P(k) := binom(N, k, p) := N k pk (1 − p)N −k The single event probability is usually defined as p := λ/N, i. e. p is inversely proportional to N, the total number of events. With this definition of p, we obtain for an infinite number of documents the following limit for the product of the binomial coefficient and pk : lim N→∞ N k pk = = lim N→∞ N · (N −1) · . . . · (N −k +1) k! λ N k = λk k! The limit is close to the actual value for k << N. For large k, the actual value is smaller than the limit. The limit of (1−p)N −k follows from the limit limN→∞(1+ x N )N = ex . lim N→∞ (1 − p)N−k = lim N→∞ 1 − λ N N −k = lim N→∞ e−λ · 1 − λ N −k = e−λ Again, the limit is close to the actual value for k << N. For large k, the actual value is larger than the limit. 4.3 Poisson distribution For an infinite number of events, the Poisson probability function is the limit of the binomial probability function. lim N→∞ binom(N, k, p) = λk k! · e−λ P(k) = poisson(k, λ) := λk k! · e−λ The probability poisson(0, 1) is equal to e−1 , which is the probability of a maximal informative signal. This shows the relationship of the Poisson distribution and information theory. After seeing the convergence of the binomial distribution, we can choose the Poisson distribution as an approximation of the independent term noise probability. First, we define the Poisson noise probability: Definition 4. The Poisson term noise probability: Ppoi (t is noisy|c) := e−λ · n(t) k=1 λk k! For independent documents, the Poisson distribution approximates the probability of the disjunction for large n(t), since the independent term noise probability is equal to the sum over the binomial probabilities where at least one of n(t) document containment events is true. Pin (t is noisy|c) = n(t) k=1 n(t) k pk (1 − p)N −k Pin (t is noisy|c) ≈ Ppoi (t is noisy|c) We have defined a frequency-based and a Poisson-based probability of being noisy, where the latter is the limit of the independence-based probability of being noisy. Before we present in the final section the usage of the noise probability for defining the probability of being informative, we emphasise in the next section that the results apply to the collection space as well as to the the document space. 5. THE COLLECTION SPACE AND THE DOCUMENT SPACE Consider the dual definitions of retrieval parameters in table 1. We associate a collection space D × T with a collection c where D is the set of documents and T is the set of terms in the collection. Let ND := |D| and NT := |T| be the number of documents and terms, respectively. We consider a document as a subset of T and a term as a subset of D. Let nT (d) := |{t|d ∈ t}| be the number of terms that occur in the document d, and let nD(t) := |{d|t ∈ d}| be the number of documents that contain the term t. In a dual way, we associate a document space L × T with a document d where L is the set of locations (also referred to as positions, however, we use the letters L and l and not P and p for avoiding confusion with probabilities) and T is the set of terms in the document. The document dimension in a collection space corresponds to the location (position) dimension in a document space. The definition makes explicit that the classical notion of term frequency of a term in a document (also referred to as the within-document term frequency) actually corresponds to the location frequency of a term in a document. For the 231 space collection document dimensions documents and terms locations and terms document/location frequency nD(t, c): Number of documents in which term t occurs in collection c nL(t, d): Number of locations (positions) at which term t occurs in document d ND(c): Number of documents in collection c NL(d): Number of locations (positions) in document d term frequency nT (d, c): Number of terms that document d contains in collection c nT (l, d): Number of terms that location l contains in document d NT (c): Number of terms in collection c NT (d): Number of terms in document d noise/occurrence P(t|c) (term noise) P(t|d) (term occurrence) containment P(d|c) (document) P(l|d) (location) informativeness − ln P(t|c) − ln P(t|d) conciseness − ln P(d|c) − ln P(l|d) P(informative) ln(P(t|c))/ ln(P(tmin, c)) ln(P(t|d))/ ln(P(tmin, d)) P(concise) ln(P(d|c))/ ln(P(dmin|c)) ln(P(l|d))/ ln(P(lmin|d)) Table 1: Retrieval parameters actual term frequency value, it is common to use the maximal occurrence (number of locations; let lf be the location frequency). tf(t, d):=lf(t, d):= Pfreq (t occurs|d) Pfreq (tmax occurs|d) = nL(t, d) nL(tmax , d) A further duality is between informativeness and conciseness (shortness of documents or locations): informativeness is based on occurrence (noise), conciseness is based on containment. We have highlighted in this section the duality between the collection space and the document space. We concentrate in this paper on the probability of a term to be noisy and informative. Those probabilities are defined in the collection space. However, the results regarding the term noise and informativeness apply to their dual counterparts: term occurrence and informativeness in a document. Also, the results can be applied to containment of documents and locations. 6. THE PROBABILITY OF BEING INFORMATIVE We showed in the previous sections that the disjointness assumption leads to frequency-based probabilities and that the independence assumption leads to Poisson probabilities. In this section, we formulate a frequency-based definition and a Poisson-based definition of the probability of being informative and then we compare the two definitions. Definition 5. The frequency-based probability of being informative: Pfreq (t is informative|c) := − ln n(t) N − ln 1 N = − logN n(t) N = 1 − logN n(t) = 1 − ln n(t) ln N We define the Poisson-based probability of being informative analogously to the frequency-based probability of being informative (see definition 5). Definition 6. The Poisson-based probability of being informative: Ppoi (t is informative|c) := − ln e−λ · Èn(t) k=1 λk k! − ln(e−λ · λ) = λ − ln Èn(t) k=1 λk k! λ − ln λ For the sum expression, the following limit holds: lim n(t)→∞ n(t) k=1 λk k! = eλ − 1 For λ >> 1, we can alter the noise and informativeness Poisson by starting the sum from 0, since eλ >> 1. Then, the minimal Poisson informativeness is poisson(0, λ) = e−λ . We obtain a simplified Poisson probability of being informative: Ppoi (t is informative|c) ≈ λ − ln Èn(t) k=0 λk k! λ = 1 − ln Èn(t) k=0 λk k! λ The computation of the Poisson sum requires an optimisation for large n(t). The implementation for this paper exploits the nature of the Poisson density: The Poisson density yields only values significantly greater than zero in an interval around λ. Consider the illustration of the noise and informativeness definitions in figure 1. The probability functions displayed are summarised in figure 2 where the simplified Poisson is used in the noise and informativeness graphs. The frequency-based noise corresponds to the linear solid curve in the noise figure. With an independence assumption, we obtain the curve in the lower triangle of the noise figure. By changing the parameter p := λ/N of the independence probability, we can lift or lower the independence curve. The noise figure shows the lifting for the value λ := ln N ≈ 9.2. The setting λ = ln N is special in the sense that the frequency-based and the Poisson-based informativeness have the same denominator, namely ln N, and the Poisson sum converges to λ. Whether we can draw more conclusions from this setting is an open question. We can conclude, that the lifting is desirable if we know for a collection that terms that occur in relatively few doc232 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Probabilityofbeingnoisy n(t): Number of documents with term t frequency independence: 1/N independence: ln(N)/N poisson: 1000 poisson: 2000 poisson: 1000,2000 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Probabilityofbeinginformative n(t): Number of documents with term t frequency independence: 1/N independence: ln(N)/N poisson: 1000 poisson: 2000 poisson: 1000,2000 Figure 1: Noise and Informativeness Probability function Noise Informativeness Frequency Pfreq Def n(t)/N ln(n(t)/N)/ ln(1/N) Interval 1/N ≤ Pfreq ≤ 1.0 0.0 ≤ Pfreq ≤ 1.0 Independence Pin Def 1 − (1 − p)n(t) ln(1 − (1 − p)n(t) )/ ln(p) Interval p ≤ Pin < 1 − e−λ ln(p) ≤ Pin ≤ 1.0 Poisson Ppoi Def e−λ Èn(t) k=1 λk k!

On the opposite, we could lower the curve when assuming that frequent terms are not too noisy, i. e. they are considered as being still significantly discriminative. The Poisson probabilities approximate the independence probabilities for large n(t); the approximation is better for larger λ. For n(t) < λ, the noise is zero whereas for n(t) > λ the noise is one. This radical behaviour can be smoothened by using a multi-dimensional Poisson distribution. Figure 1 shows a Poisson noise based on a two-dimensional Poisson: poisson(k, λ1, λ2) := π · e−λ1 · λk 1 k! + (1 − π) · e−λ2 · λk 2 k! The two dimensional Poisson shows a plateau between λ1 = 1000 and λ2 = 2000, we used here π = 0.5. The idea behind this setting is that terms that occur in less than 1000 documents are considered to be not noisy (i.e. they are informative), that terms between 1000 and 2000 are half noisy, and that terms with more than 2000 are definitely noisy. For the informativeness, we observe that the radical behaviour of Poisson is preserved. The plateau here is approximately at 1/6, and it is important to realise that this plateau is not obtained with the multi-dimensional Poisson noise using π = 0.5. The logarithm of the noise is normalised by the logarithm of a very small number, namely 0.5 · e−1000 + 0.5 · e−2000 . That is why the informativeness will be only close to one for very little noise, whereas for a bit of noise, informativeness will drop to zero. This effect can be controlled by using small values for π such that the noise in the interval [λ1; λ2] is still very little. The setting π = e−2000/6 leads to noise values of approximately e−2000/6 in the interval [λ1; λ2], the logarithms lead then to 1/6 for the informativeness. The indepence-based and frequency-based informativeness functions do not differ as much as the noise functions do. However, for the indepence-based probability of being informative, we can control the average informativeness by the definition p := λ/N whereas the control on the frequencybased is limited as we address next. For the frequency-based idf , the gradient is monotonously decreasing and we obtain for different collections the same distances of idf -values, i. e. the parameter N does not affect the distance. For an illustration, consider the distance between the value idf(tn+1) of a term tn+1 that occurs in n+1 documents, and the value idf(tn) of a term tn that occurs in n documents. idf(tn+1) − idf(tn) = ln n n + 1 The first three values of the distance function are: idf(t2) − idf(t1) = ln(1/(1 + 1)) = 0.69 idf(t3) − idf(t2) = ln(1/(2 + 1)) = 0.41 idf(t4) − idf(t3) = ln(1/(3 + 1)) = 0.29 For the Poisson-based informativeness, the gradient decreases first slowly for small n(t), then rapidly near n(t) ≈ λ and then it grows again slowly for large n(t). In conclusion, we have seen that the Poisson-based definition provides more control and parameter possibilities than 233 the frequency-based definition does. Whereas more control and parameter promises to be positive for the personalisation of retrieval systems, it bears at the same time the danger of just too many parameters. The framework presented in this paper raises the awareness about the probabilistic and information-theoretic meanings of the parameters. The parallel definitions of the frequency-based probability and the Poisson-based probability of being informative made the underlying assumptions explicit. The frequency-based probability can be explained by binary occurrence, constant containment and disjointness of documents. Independence of documents leads to Poisson, where we have to be aware that Poisson approximates the probability of a disjunction for a large number of events, but not for a small number. This theoretical result explains why experimental investigations on Poisson (see [7]) show that a Poisson estimation does work better for frequent (bad, noisy) terms than for rare (good, informative) terms. In addition to the collection-wide parameter setting, the framework presented here allows for document-dependent settings, as explained for the independence probability. This is in particular interesting for heterogeneous and structured collections, since documents are different in nature (size, quality, root document, sub document), and therefore, binary occurrence and constant containment are less appropriate than in relatively homogeneous collections. 7. SUMMARY The definition of the probability of being informative transforms the informative interpretation of the idf into a probabilistic interpretation, and we can use the idf -based probability in probabilistic retrieval approaches. We showed that the classical definition of the noise (document frequency) in the inverse document frequency can be explained by three assumptions: the term within-document occurrence probability is binary, the document containment probability is constant, and the document containment events are disjoint. By explicitly and mathematically formulating the assumptions, we showed that the classical definition of idf does not take into account parameters such as the different nature (size, quality, structure, etc.) of documents in a collection, or the different nature of terms (coverage, importance, position, etc.) in a document. We discussed that the absence of those parameters is compensated by a leverage effect of the within-document term occurrence probability and the document containment probability. By applying an independence rather a disjointness assumption for the document containment, we could establish a link between the noise probability (term occurrence in a collection), information theory and Poisson. From the frequency-based and the Poisson-based probabilities of being noisy, we derived the frequency-based and Poisson-based probabilities of being informative. The frequency-based probability is relatively smooth whereas the Poisson probability is radical in distinguishing between noisy or not noisy, and informative or not informative, respectively. We showed how to smoothen the radical behaviour of Poisson with a multidimensional Poisson. The explicit and mathematical formulation of idf - and Poisson-assumptions is the main result of this paper. Also, the paper emphasises the duality of idf and tf , collection space and document space, respectively. Thus, the result applies to term occurrence and document containment in a collection, and it applies to term occurrence and position containment in a document. This theoretical framework is useful for understanding and deciding the parameter estimation and combination in probabilistic retrieval models. The links between indepence-based noise as document frequency, probabilistic interpretation of idf , information theory and Poisson described in this paper may lead to variable probabilistic idf and tf definitions and combinations as required in advanced and personalised information retrieval systems.

    "original_translation": "Una definición basada en la frecuencia y basada en Poisson de la probabilidad de ser informativo del Departamento de Ciencias de la Computación de Thomas Roelleke, Queen Mary, Universidad de Londres, thor@dcs.qmul.ac.uk Resumen Este documento informa sobre investigaciones teóricas sobre los supuestos que subyacen al documento inversoFrecuencia (IDF). Mostramos que una función de probabilidad intuitiva basada en IDF para la probabilidad de que un término sea informativo asume eventos de documentos disjuntos. Al asumir que los documentos son independientes en lugar de disjuntos, llegamos a una probabilidad basada en Poisson de ser informativos. El marco es útil para comprender y decidir la estimación de parámetros y la combinación en modelos de recuperación probabilística. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos H.3.3 [Búsqueda y recuperación de información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Teoría 1. Introducción y antecedentes La frecuencia de documentos inverso (IDF) es uno de los parámetros más exitosos para una clasificación basada en la relevancia de objetos recuperados. Siendo n el número total de documentos, y n (t) es el número de documentos en los que ocurre el término t, el IDF se define de la siguiente manera: IDF (t): = - log n (t) n, 0 <= IDF(t) <∞ La clasificación basada en la suma de los valores IDF de los términos de consulta que ocurren en los documentos recuperados funciona bien, esto se ha mostrado en numerosas aplicaciones. Además, es bien sabido que la combinación de un peso de término específico de documento y las FDI funcionan mejor que las FDI solas. Este enfoque se conoce como TF-IDF, donde tf (t, d) (0 <= tf (t, d) <= 1) es la llamada frecuencia térmica del término t en el documento d.La FDI refleja el poder discriminatorio (informatividad) de un término, mientras que el TF refleja la ocurrencia de un término. La FDI por sí sola funciona mejor que el TF solo. Una explicación podría ser el problema de TF con los términos que ocurren en muchos documentos;Nos referemos a esos términos como términos ruidosos. Utilizamos la noción de términos ruidosos en lugar de términos frecuentes, ya que los términos frecuentes deja abiertos si nos referimos a la frecuencia del documento de un término en una colección o a la llamada frecuencia de término (también conocida como con frecuencia de indocumento) de un término en un término en undocumento. Asociamos el ruido con la frecuencia del documento de un término en una colección, y asociamos la ocurrencia con la frecuencia de inincumento de un término. El TF de un término ruidoso podría ser alto en un documento, pero los términos ruidosos no son buenos candidatos para representar un documento. Por lo tanto, la eliminación de términos ruidosos (conocidos como eliminación de palabras de parada) es esencial al aplicar TF. En un enfoque TF-IDF, la eliminación de las palabras de parada es conceptualmente obsoleta, si las palabras de parada son solo palabras con IDF bajas. Desde un punto de vista probabilístico, TF es un valor con una interpretación probabilística basada en la frecuencia, mientras que IDF tiene una interpretación informativa en lugar de una probabilística. La interpretación probabilística faltante de las FDI es un problema en los modelos de recuperación probabilística donde combinamos un conocimiento incierto de diferentes dimensiones (por ejemplo .: Información de los términos, estructura de documentos, calidad de documentos, edad de documentos, etc.) de modo que una buena estimación de la estimación de laSe logra la probabilidad de relevancia. Una solución intuitiva es una normalización de IDF de tal manera que obtenemos valores en el intervalo [0;1]. Por ejemplo, considere una normalización basada en el valor máximo de IDF. Sea t el conjunto de términos que ocurren en una colección. Pfreq (t es informativo): = idf (t) maxidf maxidf: = max ({idf (t) | t ∈ T}), maxidf <= - log (1/n) minidf: = min ({idf (t)| t ∈ T}), minidf> = 0 minidf maxidf ≤ pfreq (t es informativo) ≤ 1.0 Esta función de probabilidad basada en frecuencia cubre el intervalo [0;1] Si la IDF mínima es igual a cero, que es el caso si tenemos al menos un término que ocurre en todos los documentos. ¿Podemos interpretar PFREQ, las IDF normalizadas, como la probabilidad de que el término sea informativo? Al investigar la interpretación probabilística de las 227 IDF normalizadas, hicimos varias observaciones relacionadas con la desargación e independencia de los eventos de documentos. Estas observaciones se informan en la Sección 3. Mostramos en la Sección 3.1 que la probabilidad de ruido basada en la frecuencia N (t) N utilizada en la definición clásica de IDF puede explicarse por tres supuestos: ocurrencia de término binario, contención constante de documentos y desjodidad de los eventos de contención de documentos. En la Sección 3.2 mostramos que al suponer la independencia de los documentos, obtenemos 1 - E - 1 ≈ 1 - 0.37 como el límite superior de la probabilidad de ruido de un término. El valor E - 1 está relacionado con el logaritmo e investigamos en la Sección 3.3 el enlace a la teoría de la información. En la Sección 4, vinculamos los resultados de las secciones anteriores a la teoría de la probabilidad. Mostramos los pasos desde posibles mundos hasta distribución binomial y distribución de Poisson. En la Sección 5, enfatizamos que el marco teórico de este documento es aplicable tanto para IDF como para TF. Finalmente, en la Sección 6, basamos la definición de la probabilidad de ser informativo sobre los resultados de las secciones anteriores y comparar definiciones basadas en frecuencia y basadas en Poisson.2. Antecedentes La relación entre frecuencias, probabilidades y teoría de la información (entropía) ha sido el foco de muchos investigadores. En esta sección de antecedentes, nos centramos en el trabajo que investiga la aplicación de la distribución de Poisson en IR ya que una parte principal del trabajo presentado en este documento aborda los supuestos subyacentes de Poisson.[4] propone un modelo de 2 poisson que tenga en cuenta la naturaleza diferente de los documentos relevantes y no relevantes, términos raros (palabras de contenido) y términos frecuentes (términos ruidosos, palabras de función, palabras de parada).[9] muestra experimentalmente que la mayoría de los términos (palabras) en una colección se distribuyen de acuerdo con un modelo N-poisson de baja dimensión.[10] utiliza un modelo de 2 poisson para incluir probabilidades basadas en frecuencia a término en el modelo de recuperación probabilística. La escala no lineal de la función Poisson mostró una mejora significativa en comparación con una probabilidad lineal basada en la frecuencia. El modelo Poisson se aplicó aquí al término frecuencia de un término en un documento. Generalizaremos la discusión señalando que la frecuencia del documento y la frecuencia de término son parámetros duales en el espacio de recopilación y el espacio de documentos, respectivamente. Nuestra discusión sobre la distribución de Poisson se centra en la frecuencia del documento en una colección en lugar de en el término frecuencia en un documento.[7] y [6] abordan la desviación de IDF y Poisson, y aplican mezclas de Poisson para lograr mejores estimaciones basadas en Poisson. Los resultados probaron nuevamente experimentalmente que un Poisson ontimensional no funciona para términos raros, por lo tanto, se proponen mezclas de poisson y parámetros adicionales.[3], Sección 3.3, ilustra y resume integralmente las relaciones entre frecuencias, probabilidades y Poisson. Las diferentes definiciones de IDF se ponen en contexto y se define una noción de ruido, donde el ruido se ve como el complemento de las FDI. Usamos en nuestro documento una noción diferente de ruido: consideramos un ruido basado en la frecuencia que corresponde a la frecuencia del documento, y consideramos un ruido de término que se basa en la independencia de los eventos de documentos.[11], [12], [8] y [1] Enlace frecuencias y estimación de probabilidad a la teoría de la información.[12] establece un marco en el que los modelos de recuperación de información se formalizan en función de la inferencia probabilística. Un componente clave es el uso de un espacio de eventos disjuntos, donde el marco utiliza principalmente términos como eventos disjuntos. La probabilidad de ser informativa definida en nuestro documento puede verse como la probabilidad de los términos disjuntos en el término espacio de [12].[8] Dirección de entropía y distribuciones bibliométricas. La entropía es máxima si todos los eventos son equiprobables y la ley de Lotka basada en la frecuencia (N/iλ es el número de científicos que han escrito las publicaciones I, donde N y λ son parámetros de distribución), ZIPF y la distribución de Pareto están relacionadas. La distribución de Pareto es el caso continuo de Lotka y Lotka y Zipf Show equivalencias. La distribución de Pareto es utilizada por [2] para la normalización de la frecuencia de término. La distribución de Pareto se compara con la distribución de Poisson en el sentido de que Pareto es de cola de grasa, i.mi.Pareto asigna mayores probabilidades a grandes cantidades de eventos que las distribuciones de Poisson. Esto hace que Pareto sea interesante ya que se siente que Poisson es demasiado radical en eventos frecuentes. Restringimos en este documento a la discusión de Poisson, sin embargo, nuestros resultados muestran que, de hecho, una distribución más suave que Poisson promete ser un buen candidato para mejorar la estimación de las probabilidades en la recuperación de la información.[1] establece un vínculo teórico entre TF-IDF y la teoría de la información y la investigación teórica sobre el significado de TF-IDF aclara el modelo estadístico en el que las diferentes medidas se basan comúnmente. Esta motivación coincide con la motivación de nuestro artículo: investigamos teóricamente los supuestos de las FDI y Poisson clásicas para una mejor comprensión de la estimación y combinación de parámetros.3. De disjunto a independiente definimos y discutimos en esta sección tres probabilidades: la probabilidad de ruido basada en la frecuencia (Definición 1), la probabilidad de ruido total para documentos disjuntos (definición 2).y la probabilidad de ruido para documentos independientes (definición 3).3.1 Ocurrencia binaria, contención constante y disgusto de los documentos que mostramos en esta sección, que la probabilidad de ruido basada en la frecuencia n (t) n en la definición de IDF puede explicarse como una probabilidad total con ocurrencia de término binario, contención constante de documentos y disgusto deConsejos de documento. Nos referimos a una función de probabilidad como binaria si para todos los eventos la probabilidad es 1.0 o 0.0. La probabilidad de ocurrencia P (t | d) es binaria, si P (t | d) es igual a 1.0 si t ∈ D, y p (t | d) es igual a 0.0, de lo contrario. P (t | d) es binario: ⇐⇒ p (t | d) = 1.0 ∨ p (t | d) = 0.0 Nos referimos a una función de probabilidad como constante si para todos los eventos la probabilidad es igual. La probabilidad de contención del documento refleja la posibilidad de que un documento ocurra en una colección. Esta probabilidad de contención es constante si no tenemos información sobre la contención del documento o ignoramos que los documentos difieren en contención. La contención podría derivarse, por ejemplo, del tamaño, calidad, edad, enlaces, etc. de un documento. Para una contención constante en una colección con n documentos, 1 n a menudo se supone como la probabilidad de contención. Generalizamos esta definición e introducimos la constante λ donde 0 ≤ λ ≤ N. La contención de un documento D depende de la colección C, esto se refleja en la notación p (d | c) utilizada para la contención 228 de un documento. P (d | c) es constante: ⇐⇒ ∀d: p (d | c) = λ n para documentos disjuntos que cubren todo el espacio de eventos, establecemos λ = 1 y obtenemos èd p (d | c) = 1.0. A continuación, definimos la probabilidad de ruido basada en la frecuencia y la probabilidad de ruido total para documentos disjuntos. Presentamos la notación del evento que t es ruidosa y se produce para marcar la diferencia entre la probabilidad de ruido P (t es ruidoso | c) en una colección y la probabilidad de ocurrencia P (t ocurre | d) en un documento más explícito, manteniéndose asíTenga en cuenta que la probabilidad de ruido corresponde a la probabilidad de ocurrencia de un término en una colección. Definición 1. La probabilidad de ruido del término basado en frecuencia: PFREQ (t es ruidoso | c): = n (t) n definición 2. La probabilidad de ruido de término total para documentos disjunto: PDIS (t es ruidoso | c): = d p (t ocurre | d) · p (d | c) Ahora, podemos formular un teorema que hace que supuestaciones explícitas que explicen las IDF clásicas. Teorema 1. Suposiciones de IDF: si la probabilidad de ocurrencia P (t | d) del término t en los documentos d es binario, y la probabilidad de contención p (d | c) de los documentos d es constante, y las contenedores de documentos son eventos disjuntos, entonces la probabilidad de ruido paraDocumentos disjuntos es igual a la probabilidad de ruido basada en la frecuencia. PDIS (t es ruidoso | c) = pfreq (t es ruidoso | c) prueba. Los supuestos son: ∀d: (p (t ocurre | d) = 1 ∨ p (t ocurre | d) = 0) ∧ p (d | c) = λ n ∧ d p (d | c) = 1.0 obtenemos: Pdis (t es ruidoso | c) = d | t∈D 1 n = n (t) n = pfreq (t es ruidoso | c) El resultado anterior no es una sorpresa, pero es una formulación matemática de supuestos que pueden serSe usa para explicar las IDF clásicas. Los supuestos hacen explícitos que los diferentes tipos de tipos de términos ocurren en documentos (frecuencia de un término, importancia de un término, posición de un término, parte del documento donde ocurre el término, etc.) y los diferentes tipos de contención de documentos (tamaño, calidad de calidad, la edad, etc.) se ignoran y las contenedores de documentos se consideran eventos disjuntos. De los supuestos, podemos concluir que las FDI (ruido basado en frecuencia, respectivamente) es una estimación relativamente simple pero estricta. Aún así, FDF funciona bien. Esto podría explicarse por un efecto de apalancamiento que justifica la ocurrencia binaria y la contención constante: el término ocurrencia para documentos pequeños tiende a ser mayor que para documentos grandes, mientras que la contención de documentos pequeños tiende a ser más pequeño que para documentos grandes. Desde ese punto de vista, IDF significa que P (T ∧ D | C) es constante para todos los D en el que ocurre T, y P (T ∧ D | C) es cero de otra manera. La ocurrencia y la contención pueden ser específicos. Por ejemplo, establecer P (t∧d | c) = 1/nd (c) si t ocurre en d, donde nd (c) es el número de documentos en la colección c (usamos antes de solo n). Elegimos una ocurrencia dependiente del documento P (t | d): = 1/nt (d), i.mi.La probabilidad de ocurrencia es igual al inverso de NT (d), que es el número total de términos en el documento d.A continuación, elegimos la contención p (d | c): = nt (d)/nt (c) · nt (c)/nd (c) donde nt (d)/nt (c) es una normalización de longitud del documento (númerode términos en el documento D dividido por el número de términos en la colección c), y nt (c)/nd (c) es un factor constante de la colección (número de términos en la colección c dividido por el número de documentos en la colección c). Obtenemos P (T∧D | C) = 1/nd (c). En una función tf -IDF -rprieval, el componente TF refleja la probabilidad de ocurrencia de un término en un documento. Esta es una explicación adicional por qué podemos estimar la FDI con una P (T | D) simple, ya que el TF-IDF combinado contiene la probabilidad de ocurrencia. La probabilidad de contención corresponde a una normalización del documento (normalización de la longitud del documento, longitud del documento giratado) y normalmente se adjunta al componente TF o al producto TF -IDF. La suposición de desargación es típica de las probabilidades basadas en frecuencia. Desde el punto de vista de la teoría de la probabilidad, podemos considerar los documentos como eventos disjuntos, para lograr un modelo teórico sólido para explicar las IDF clásicas. Pero, ¿la desargación refleja el mundo real donde la contención de un documento parece ser independiente de la contención de otro documento? En la siguiente sección, reemplazamos la suposición de desargación por la suposición de independencia.3.2 El límite superior de la probabilidad de ruido para documentos independientes para documentos independientes, calculamos la probabilidad de una disyunción como de costumbre, a saber, como el complemento de la probabilidad de la conjunción de los eventos negados: P (D1 ∨ ... ∨ DN)= 1 - p (¬D1 ∧ ... ∧ ¬DN) = 1 - d (1 - p (d)) La probabilidad de ruido puede considerarse como la conjunción del término ocurrencia y la contención del documento. P (t es ruidoso | c): = P (t ocurre ∧ (d1 ∨ ... ∨ dn) | c) Para documentos disjuntos, esta visión de la probabilidad de ruido condujo a la definición 2. Para documentos independientes, ahora usamos la conjunción de eventos negados. Definición 3. El término probabilidad de ruido para documentos independientes: el pin (t es ruidoso | c): = d (1 - p (t ocurre | d) · p (d | c)) con ocurrencia binaria y una contención constante p (d | c): = λ/n, obtenemos el término ruido de un término t que ocurre en n (t) documentos: pin (t es ruidoso | c) = 1 - 1 - λ n n (t) 229 para ocurrencia binaria y documentos disjunto, la probabilidad de contención fue 1/N. Ahora, con documentos independientes, podemos usar λ como parámetro de colección que controla la probabilidad de contención promedio. Mostramos a través del siguiente teorema que el límite superior de la probabilidad de ruido depende de λ.Teorema 2. El límite superior de ser ruidoso: si la ocurrencia p (t | d) es binaria, y la contención p (d | c) es constante, y los contenedores de documentos son eventos independientes, entonces 1 - e - λ es el límite superior delProbabilidad de ruido.∀T: PIN (t es ruidoso | c) <1 - e - λ prueba. El límite superior de la probabilidad de ruido independiente se deduce desde el límite limn → ∞ (1 + x n) n = ex (ver cualquier libro de matemáticas integral, por ejemplo, [5], para la ecuación de convergencia de la función Euler). Con x = −λ, obtenemos: lim n → ∞ 1 - λ n n = e - λ para el término ruido, tenemos: pin (t es ruidoso | c) = 1 - 1 - λ n n (t) pin (T es ruidoso | c) es estrictamente monótono: el ruido de un término TN es menor que el ruido de un término TN+1, donde se produce TN en n documentos y Tn+1 ocurre en documentos n+1. Por lo tanto, un término con n = n tiene la mayor probabilidad de ruido. Para una colección con muchos documentos infinitos, el límite superior de la probabilidad de ruido para los términos que ocurre en todos los documentos se convierte en: lim n → ∞ pin (tn es ruidoso) = lim n → ∞ 1 - 1 - λ n n = 1 - e−λ aplicando una independencia en lugar de una suposición de desargación, obtenemos la probabilidad e - 1 de que un término no sea ruidoso incluso si el término ocurre en todos los documentos. En el caso disjunto, la probabilidad de ruido es una para un término que ocurre en todos los documentos. Si vemos p (d | c): = λ/n como la contención promedio, entonces λ es grande para un término que ocurre principalmente en documentos grandes, y λ es pequeño para un término que ocurre principalmente en documentos pequeños. Por lo tanto, el ruido de un término t es grande si t ocurre en n (t) documentos grandes y el ruido es menor si se produce en documentos pequeños. Alternativamente, podemos asumir una contención constante y una ocurrencia dependiente de término. Si asumimos p (d | c): = 1, entonces p (t | d): = λ/n puede interpretarse como la probabilidad promedio de que t represente un documento. La suposición común es que la probabilidad promedio de contención u ocurrencia es proporcional a N (t). Sin embargo, aquí hay potencial adicional: las leyes estadísticas (ver [3] sobre Luhn y ZIPF) indican que la probabilidad promedio podría seguir una distribución normal, i.mi.Probabilidades pequeñas para N (t) pequeños y N (t) grandes, y mayores probabilidades para mediano N (t). Para el caso monótono que investigamos aquí, el ruido de un término con n (t) = 1 es igual a 1 - (1 - λ/n) = λ/n y el ruido de un término con n (t) = n escerca de 1- e - λ. En la siguiente sección, relacionamos el valor E - λ a la teoría de la información.3.3 La probabilidad de una señal informativa máxima La probabilidad E - 1 es especial en el sentido de que una señal con esa probabilidad es una señal con información máxima derivada de la definición de entropía. Considere la definición de la contribución de entropía H (t) de una señal t.H (t): = p (t) · - ln p (t) Formamos la primera derivación para calcular el óptimo.∂h (t) ∂p (t) = - ln p (t) + −1 p (t) · p (t) = - (1 + ln p (t)) para obtener óptimo, usamos: 0 = −(1 + ln p (t)) La contribución de entropía H (t) es máxima para p (t) = e - 1. Este resultado no depende de la base del logaritmo como vemos a continuación: ∂h (t) ∂p (t) = - logb p (t) + −1 p (t) · ln b · p (t) = −1 ln b + logb p (t) = - 1 + ln p (t) ln b resumimos este resultado en el siguiente teorema: Teorema 3. La probabilidad de una señal informativa máxima: la probabilidad PMAX = E - 1 ≈ 0.37 es la probabilidad de una señal informativa máxima. La entropía de una señal informativa máxima es Hmax = E - 1. Prueba. La probabilidad y entropía se deducen de la derivación anterior. El complemento de la probabilidad de ruido máxima es e - λ y ahora estamos buscando una generalización de la definición de entropía de tal manera que e - λ es la probabilidad de una señal informativa máxima. Podemos generalizar la definición de entropía calculando la integral de λ+ ln p (t), i.mi.Esta derivación es cero para e - λ. Obtenemos una entropía generalizada: - (λ + ln p (t)) d (p (t)) = p (t) · (1 - λ - ln p (t)) La entropía generalizada corresponde para λ = 1 alEntropía clásica. Al pasar de los documentos disjuntos a independientes, hemos establecido un vínculo entre el complemento de la probabilidad de ruido de un término que ocurre en todos los documentos y la teoría de la información. A continuación, vinculamos documentos independientes con la teoría de la probabilidad.4. El vínculo con la teoría de la probabilidad que revisamos para documentos independientes tres conceptos de teoría de probabilidad: posibles mundos, distribución binomial y distribución de Poisson.4.1 Posibles mundos Cada conjunción de eventos de documentos (para cada documento, consideramos dos eventos de documentos: el documento puede ser verdadero o falso) está asociado con un llamado mundo posible. Por ejemplo, considere los ocho mundos posibles para tres documentos (n = 3).230 World W Conjunción W7 D1 ∧ D2 ∧ D3 W6 D1 ∧ D2 ∧ ∧ ¬D1∧ ¬D2 ∧ D3 W0 ¬D1 ∧ ¬D2 ∧ ¬D3 Con cada mundo W, asociamos una probabilidad µ (W), que es igual al producto de las probabilidades únicas de los eventos de documentos.Probabilidad del mundo W µ (W) W7 λ n ¡3 · 1 - λ n ¡0 w6 λ n ¡2 · 1 - λ n ¡1 W5 λ n ¡2 · 1 - λ n ¡1 W4 λ n ¡1 · 1- λ n ¡2 W3 λ n ¡2 · 1 - λ n ¡1 1 w2 λ n ¡1 · 1 - λ n ¡2 w1 λ n ¡1 · 1 - λ n ¡2 w0 λ n ¡0 · 1 - λ n.N ¡3 La suma sobre los posibles mundos en los que los documentos k son verdaderos y los documentos N -k son falsos es igual a la función de probabilidad de la distribución binomial, ya que el coeficiente binomial produce el número de mundos posibles en los que los documentos K son ciertos.4.2 Distribución binomial La función de probabilidad binomial produce la probabilidad de que K de n eventos sean verdaderos donde cada evento es cierto con la probabilidad de evento único p.P (k): = binom (n, k, p): = n k pk (1 - p) n −k La probabilidad de evento único generalmente se define como p: = λ/n, i.mi.P es inversamente proporcional a N, el número total de eventos. Con esta definición de P, obtenemos para un número infinito de documentos el siguiente límite para el producto del coeficiente binomial y PK: lim n → ∞ n k pk = = lim n → ∞ n · (n −1) ·...· (N −k +1) k!λ n k = λk k! El límite está cerca del valor real para k << N. Para K grande, el valor real es menor que el límite. El límite de (1 - P) n −k sigue desde el límite limn → ∞ (1+ x n) n = ex.lim n → ∞ (1 - p) n - k = lim n → ∞ 1 - λ n n −k = lim n → ∞ e - λ · 1 - λ n −k = e - λ nuevamente, el límite está cerca delValor real para k << N. Para K grande, el valor real es mayor que el límite.4.3 Distribución de Poisson Para un número infinito de eventos, la función de probabilidad de Poisson es el límite de la función de probabilidad binomial.lim n → ∞ binom (n, k, p) = λk k!· E - λ p (k) = poisson (k, λ): = λk k!· E - λ La probabilidad Poisson (0, 1) es igual a E - 1, que es la probabilidad de una señal informativa máxima. Esto muestra la relación de la distribución de Poisson y la teoría de la información. Después de ver la convergencia de la distribución binomial, podemos elegir la distribución de Poisson como una aproximación de la probabilidad de ruido de término independiente. Primero, definimos la probabilidad de ruido de Poisson: definición 4. La probabilidad de ruido del término de Poisson: PPOI (t es ruidoso | c): = e - λ · n (t) k = 1 λk k! Para documentos independientes, la distribución de Poisson se aproxima a la probabilidad de la disyunción para N (t) grande, ya que la probabilidad de ruido del término independiente es igual a la suma sobre las probabilidades binomiales donde al menos uno de los eventos de contención de documentos de N (t) es cierto. Pin (t es ruidoso | c) = n (t) k = 1 n (t) k pk (1 - p) n −k pin (t es ruidoso | c) ≈ pPoi (t es ruidoso | c) hemos definidoUna probabilidad basada en frecuencia y basada en Poisson de ser ruidosa, donde este último es el límite de la probabilidad basada en la independencia de ser ruidoso. Antes de presentar en la sección final el uso de la probabilidad de ruido para definir la probabilidad de ser informativo, enfatizamos en la siguiente sección que los resultados se aplican al espacio de recolección, así como al espacio del documento.5. El espacio de recopilación y el espacio del documento consideran las definiciones duales de parámetros de recuperación en la Tabla 1. Asociamos un espacio de colección D × T con una colección C donde D es el conjunto de documentos y t es el conjunto de términos en la colección. Sea nd: = | d |y nt: = | t |ser el número de documentos y términos, respectivamente. Consideramos un documento como un subconjunto de t y un término como un subconjunto de D. Sea nt (d): = | {t | d ∈ T} |ser el número de términos que ocurren en el documento d, y dejar nd (t): = | {d | t ∈ D} |ser el número de documentos que contienen el término t.De una manera dual, asociamos un espacio de documento L × T con un documento D donde L es el conjunto de ubicaciones (también denominadas posiciones, sin embargo, usamos las letras L y L y no P y P para evitar confusiones con probabilidades) y t es el conjunto de términos en el documento. La dimensión del documento en un espacio de colección corresponde a la dimensión de ubicación (posición) en un espacio de documento. La definición hace explícita que la noción clásica de la frecuencia del término de un término en un documento (también conocido como la frecuencia del término dentro del documento) en realidad corresponde a la frecuencia de ubicación de un término en un documento. Para el 231 Space Collection Document Dimensions Documents y Términos ubicaciones y términos Documento/frecuencia de ubicación ND (t, c): Número de documentos en los que el término T ocurre en la colección C nl (t, d): número de ubicaciones (posiciones) en las cualesEl término T ocurre en el documento d nd (c): número de documentos en la colección c nl (d): número de ubicaciones (posiciones) en el documento d frecuencia de término nt (d, c): número de términos que el documento d contiene en la colección cNT (L, D): Número de términos que la ubicación L contiene en el documento d nt (c): número de términos en la colección c nt (d): número de términos en el documento d ruido/ocurrencia p (t | c) (términoruido) p (t | d) (término ocurrencia) contención p (d | c) (documento) p (l | d) (ubicación) INFORMATISln p (d | c) - ln p (l | d) p (informativo) ln (p (t | c))/ ln (p (tmin, c)) ln (p (t | d))/ ln (P (tmin, d)) p (conciso) ln (p (d | c))/ ln (p (dmin | c)) ln (p (l | d))/ ln (p (lmin | d)) mesa1: Parámetros de recuperación Valor de frecuencia de término real, es común usar la ocurrencia máxima (número de ubicaciones;Deje que LF sea la frecuencia de ubicación).tf (t, d): = lf (t, d): = pfreq (t ocurre | d) pfreq (tmax ocurre | d) = nl (t, d) nl (tmax, d) Una dualidad adicional es entre la informatividad yConcisión (escasez de documentos o ubicaciones): la información se basa en la ocurrencia (ruido), la concisión se basa en la contención. Hemos destacado en esta sección la dualidad entre el espacio de colección y el espacio de documentos. Nos concentramos en este documento sobre la probabilidad de que un término sea ruidoso e informativo. Esas probabilidades se definen en el espacio de recolección. Sin embargo, los resultados con respecto al término ruido e informatividad se aplican a sus homólogos duales: ocurrencia de término e información en un documento. Además, los resultados se pueden aplicar a la contención de documentos y ubicaciones.6. La probabilidad de ser informativa mostramos en las secciones anteriores que la suposición de desargación conduce a probabilidades basadas en frecuencia y que la suposición de independencia conduce a las probabilidades de Poisson. En esta sección, formulamos una definición basada en frecuencia y una definición basada en Poisson de la probabilidad de ser informativa y luego comparamos las dos definiciones. Definición 5. La probabilidad basada en frecuencia de ser informativa: PFREQ (t es informativo | C): =-Ln n (t) n-ln 1 n =-logn n (t) n = 1-logn n (t) = 1-lnn (t) ln n Definimos la probabilidad basada en Poisson de ser informativo de forma análoga a la probabilidad basada en la frecuencia de ser informativo (ver definición 5). Definición 6. La probabilidad basada en Poisson de ser informativa: PPOI (t es informativo | c): =-ln e-λ · èn (t) k = 1 λk k!- ln (e - λ · λ) = λ - ln èn (t) k = 1 λk k!λ - ln λ Para la expresión de suma, el siguiente límite se mantiene: lim n (t) → ∞ n (t) k = 1 λk k!= eλ - 1 para λ >> 1, podemos alterar el ruido e informatividad Poisson comenzando la suma de 0, desde eλ >> 1. Entonces, la información mínima de Poisson es Poisson (0, λ) = e - λ. Obtenemos una probabilidad simplificada de Poisson de ser informativo: PPOI (t es informativo | c) ≈ λ - ln èn (t) k = 0 λk k!λ = 1 - ln èn (t) k = 0 λk k!λ El cálculo de la suma de Poisson requiere una optimización para N (t) grande. La implementación para este documento explota la naturaleza de la densidad de Poisson: la densidad de Poisson produce solo valores significativamente mayores que cero en un intervalo alrededor de λ. Considere la ilustración de las definiciones de ruido e información en la Figura 1. Las funciones de probabilidad que se muestran se resumen en la Figura 2 donde el Poisson simplificado se usa en los gráficos de ruido e información. El ruido basado en la frecuencia corresponde a la curva sólida lineal en la figura de ruido. Con una suposición de independencia, obtenemos la curva en el triángulo inferior de la figura de ruido. Al cambiar el parámetro p: = λ/n de la probabilidad de independencia, podemos levantar o bajar la curva de independencia. La figura de ruido muestra el levantamiento del valor λ: = ln n ≈ 9.2. La configuración λ = ln n es especial en el sentido de que la información basada en frecuencia y basada en Poisson tiene el mismo denominador, a saber, ln n, y la suma de Poisson converge a λ. Si podemos sacar más conclusiones de esta configuración es una pregunta abierta. Podemos concluir que el levantamiento es deseable si sabemos para una colección que los términos que ocurren en relativamente pocos DOC232 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.6 0.8 1 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Probabilidad de la nocturna N (t): número de documentos con la independencia de la frecuencia T a término: Independencia:1/n Independencia: LN (N)/N Poisson: 1000 Poisson: 2000 Poisson: 1000,2000 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 0.8 1 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Probabilidad de la formación de N (t): Número de documentos con Término T de la frecuencia Térmica: 1/N Independencia: LN (N)/N Poisson: 1000 Poisson: 2000 Poisson: 1000,2000 Figura 1: Función de probabilidad de ruido e informatividad Informatividad de ruido Freeq Def N (T)/N Ln (N (T)/N)/N)Intervalo LN (1/N) 1/N ≤ PFREQ ≤ 1.0 0.0 ≤ PFREQ ≤ 1.0 Pin de independencia DEF 1 - (1 - P) N (T) Ln (1 - (1 - P) N (T))/Ln (p) intervalo p ≤ pin <1 - e - λ ln (p) ≤ pin ≤ 1.0 poisson ppoi def e - λ èn (t) k = 1 λk k!(λ - ln èn (t) k = 1 λk k!)/(λ - ln λ) intervalo e - λ · λ ≤ ppoi <1 - e - λ (λ - ln (eλ - 1))/(λ -ln λ) ≤ PPOI ≤ 1.0 Poisson PPOI Simplificado Def e - λ èn (t) k = 0 λk k!(λ - ln èn (t) k = 0 λk k!)/λ intervalo e - λ ≤ pPOI <1.0 0.0 <pPOI ≤ 1.0 Figura 2: Las funciones de probabilidad no son garantía para encontrar documentos relevantes, i.mi.Suponemos que los términos raros siguen siendo relativamente ruidosos. Por lo contrario, podríamos bajar la curva al suponer que los términos frecuentes no son demasiado ruidosos, i.mi.Se considera que aún son significativamente discriminativos. Las probabilidades de Poisson se aproximan a las probabilidades de independencia para N (t) grande;La aproximación es mejor para λ más grande. Para n (t) <λ, el ruido es cero, mientras que para n (t)> λ el ruido es uno. Este comportamiento radical se puede suavizar utilizando una distribución de Poisson multidimensional. La Figura 1 muestra un ruido de Poisson basado en un Poisson bidimensional: Poisson (k, λ1, λ2): = π · e-λ1 · λk 1 k!+ (1 - π) · e - λ2 · λk 2 k! El Poisson bidimensional muestra una meseta entre λ1 = 1000 y λ2 = 2000, usamos aquí π = 0.5. La idea detrás de este entorno es que los términos que ocurren en menos de 1000 documentos se consideran no ruidosos (es decir, son informativos), que los términos entre 1000 y 2000 son medio ruidosos, y que los términos con más de 2000 son definitivamente ruidosos. Para la información, observamos que se conserva el comportamiento radical de Poisson. La meseta aquí está aproximadamente a 1/6, y es importante darse cuenta de que esta meseta no se obtiene con el ruido de Poisson multidimensional usando π = 0.5. El logaritmo del ruido se normaliza mediante el logaritmo de un número muy pequeño, a saber, 0.5 · E - 1000 + 0.5 · E - 2000. Es por eso que la información estará solo cerca de una por muy poco ruido, mientras que por un poco de ruido, la información caerá a cero. Este efecto puede controlarse utilizando valores pequeños para π de tal manera que el ruido en el intervalo [λ1;λ2] sigue siendo muy poco. La configuración π = E - 2000/6 conduce a valores de ruido de aproximadamente E - 2000/6 en el intervalo [λ1;λ2], los logaritmos conducen luego a 1/6 para la información. Las funciones de informatividad basadas en la independencia y basadas en la frecuencia no difieren tanto como las funciones de ruido. Sin embargo, para la probabilidad basada en la independencia de ser informativos, podemos controlar la informatividad promedio por la definición p: = λ/n, mientras que el control en la frecuencia basada en la frecuencia es limitado a medida que abordamos a continuación. Para las IDF basadas en la frecuencia, el gradiente está disminuyendo monótonamente y obtenemos para diferentes colecciones las mismas distancias de valores de IDF, i.mi.El parámetro N no afecta la distancia. Para una ilustración, considere la distancia entre el valor IDF (TN+1) de un término TN+1 que ocurre en documentos n+1, y el valor IDF (TN) de un término TN que ocurre en n documentos.IDF (TN + 1) - IDF (TN) = Ln n N + 1 Los primeros tres valores de la función de distancia son: IDF (T2) - IDF (T1) = Ln (1/(1 + 1)) = 0.69 IDF (T3)-IDF (T2) = Ln (1/(2 + 1)) = 0.41 IDF (T4)-IDF (T3) = Ln (1/(3 + 1)) = 0.29 para la informatividad basada en Poisson, elEl gradiente disminuye primero lentamente para N (t) pequeño, luego rápidamente cerca de N (t) ≈ λ y luego vuelve a crecer lentamente para N (t) grande. En conclusión, hemos visto que la definición basada en Poisson proporciona más posibilidades de control y parámetros que 233 la definición basada en frecuencia. Mientras que más control y parámetro promete ser positivo para la personalización de los sistemas de recuperación, tiene al mismo tiempo el peligro de demasiados parámetros. El marco presentado en este documento aumenta la conciencia sobre los significados probabilísticos y teóricos de la información de los parámetros. Las definiciones paralelas de la probabilidad basada en frecuencia y la probabilidad basada en Poisson de ser informativa hicieron explícitos los supuestos subyacentes. La probabilidad basada en la frecuencia puede explicarse por ocurrencia binaria, contención constante y disgusto de los documentos. La independencia de los documentos lleva a Poisson, donde debemos ser conscientes de que Poisson se aproxima a la probabilidad de una disyunción para una gran cantidad de eventos, pero no para un pequeño número. Este resultado teórico explica por qué las investigaciones experimentales sobre Poisson (ver [7]) muestran que una estimación de Poisson funciona mejor para términos frecuentes (malos, ruidosos) que para términos raros (buenos, informativos). Además de la configuración de parámetros de toda la colección, el marco presentado aquí permite la configuración dependiente del documento, como se explica para la probabilidad de independencia. Esto es en particular interesante para las colecciones heterogéneas y estructuradas, ya que los documentos son de naturaleza diferente (tamaño, calidad, documento raíz, sub documento) y, por lo tanto, la ocurrencia binaria y la contención constante son menos apropiados que en colecciones relativamente homogéneas.7. Resumen La definición de la probabilidad de ser informativa transforma la interpretación informativa de las FDI en una interpretación probabilística, y podemos usar la probabilidad basada en IDF en los enfoques de recuperación probabilística. Mostramos que la definición clásica del ruido (frecuencia del documento) en la frecuencia inversa del documento puede explicarse por tres supuestos: el término probabilidad de ocurrencia dentro del documento es binaria, la probabilidad de contención del documento es constante y los eventos de contención del documento son disjuntos. Al formular explícita y matemáticamente los supuestos, demostramos que la definición clásica de las FDI no tiene en cuenta parámetros como la naturaleza diferente (tamaño, calidad, estructura, etc.) de documentos en una colección o la naturaleza diferente de los términos ((cobertura, importancia, posición, etc.) en un documento. Discutimos que la ausencia de esos parámetros es compensada por un efecto de apalancamiento de la probabilidad de ocurrencia del término dentro del documento y la probabilidad de contención del documento. Al aplicar una independencia más bien una suposición de desargación para la contención del documento, podríamos establecer un vínculo entre la probabilidad de ruido (término ocurrencia en una colección), teoría de la información y Poisson. De las probabilidades basadas en frecuencia y basadas en Poisson de ser ruidosos, derivamos las probabilidades basadas en frecuencia y basadas en Poisson de ser informativos. La probabilidad basada en la frecuencia es relativamente suave, mientras que la probabilidad de Poisson es radical para distinguir entre ruidoso o no ruidoso, e informativo o no informativo, respectivamente. Mostramos cómo suavizar el comportamiento radical de Poisson con un Poisson multidimensional. La formulación explícita y matemática de las IDF y las supuestas de Poisson es el resultado principal de este documento. Además, el documento enfatiza la dualidad de IDF y TF, espacio de colección y espacio de documentos, respectivamente. Por lo tanto, el resultado se aplica a la ocurrencia y la contención del documento en una colección, y se aplica a la ocurrencia y la contención de posición en un documento. Este marco teórico es útil para comprender y decidir la estimación y combinación de parámetros en los modelos de recuperación probabilística. Los enlaces entre el ruido basado en la independencia como frecuencia de documentos, interpretación probabilística de las FDI, la teoría de la información y el Poisson descritos en este documento pueden conducir a definiciones y combinaciones de IDF y TF probabilísticas variables según sea necesario en los sistemas de recuperación de información avanzados y personalizados.

[12] establishes a framework in which information retrieval models are formalised based on probabilistic inference.",
        "A key component is the use of a space of disjoint events, where the framework mainly uses terms as disjoint events.",

        "IDF assumptions: If the occurrence probability P(t|d) of term t over documents d is binary, and the containment probability P(d|c) of documents d is constant, and document containments are disjoint events, then the noise probability for disjoint documents is equal to the frequency-based noise probability.",
        "Pdis (t is noisy|c) = Pfreq (t is noisy|c) Proof.",
        "The assumptions are: ∀d : (P(t occurs|d) = 1 ∨ P(t occurs|d) = 0) ∧ P(d|c) = λ N ∧ d P(d|c) = 1.0 We obtain: Pdis (t is noisy|c) = d|t∈d 1 N = n(t) N = Pfreq (t is noisy|c) The above result is not a surprise but it is a mathematical formulation of assumptions that can be used to explain the classical idf .",
        "The assumptions make explicit that the different types of term occurrence in documents (frequency of a term, importance of a term, position of a term, document part where the term occurs, etc.) and the different types of document containment (size, quality, age, etc.) are ignored, and document containments are considered as disjoint events.",
        "From the assumptions, we can conclude that idf (frequencybased noise, respectively) is a relatively simple but strict estimate.",
        "Still, idf works well.",
        "This could be explained by a leverage effect that justifies the binary occurrence and constant containment: The term occurrence for small documents tends to be larger than for large documents, whereas the containment for small documents tends to be smaller than for large documents.",
        "From that point of view, idf means that P(t ∧ d|c) is constant for all d in which t occurs, and P(t ∧ d|c) is zero otherwise.",
        "The occurrence and containment can be term specific.",
        "For example, set P(t∧d|c) = 1/ND(c) if t occurs in d, where ND(c) is the number of documents in collection c (we used before just N).",
        "We choose a document-dependent occurrence P(t|d) := 1/NT (d), i. e. the occurrence probability is equal to the inverse of NT (d), which is the total number of terms in document d. Next, we choose the containment P(d|c) := NT (d)/NT (c)·NT (c)/ND(c) where NT (d)/NT (c) is a document length normalisation (number of terms in document d divided by the number of terms in collection c), and NT (c)/ND(c) is a constant factor of the collection (number of terms in collection c divided by the number of documents in collection c).",
        "We obtain P(t∧d|c) = 1/ND(c).",
        "In a tf-idf -retrieval function, the tf -component reflects the occurrence probability of a term in a document.",
        "This is a further explanation why we can estimate the idf with a simple P(t|d), since the combined tf-idf contains the occurrence probability.",
        "The containment probability corresponds to a document normalisation (document length normalisation, pivoted document length) and is normally attached to the tf -component or the tf-idf -product.",
        "The disjointness assumption is typical for frequency-based probabilities.",
        "From a probability theory point of view, we can consider documents as disjoint events, in order to achieve a sound theoretical model for explaining the classical idf .",
        "But does disjointness reflect the real world where the containment of a document appears to be independent of the containment of another document?",
        "In the next section, we replace the disjointness assumption by the independence assumption. 3.2 The upper bound of the noise probability for independent documents For independent documents, we compute the probability of a disjunction as usual, namely as the complement of the probability of the conjunction of the negated events: P(d1 ∨ . . . ∨ dN ) = 1 − P(¬d1 ∧ . . . ∧ ¬dN ) = 1 − d (1 − P(d)) The noise probability can be considered as the conjunction of the term occurrence and the document containment.",
        "P(t is noisy|c) := P(t occurs ∧ (d1 ∨ . . . ∨ dN )|c) For disjoint documents, this view of the noise probability led to definition 2.",
        "For independent documents, we use now the conjunction of negated events.",
        "Definition 3.",
        "The term noise probability for independent documents: Pin (t is noisy|c) := d (1 − P(t occurs|d) · P(d|c)) With binary occurrence and a constant containment P(d|c) := λ/N, we obtain the term noise of a term t that occurs in n(t) documents: Pin (t is noisy|c) = 1 − 1 − λ N n(t) 229 For binary occurrence and disjoint documents, the containment probability was 1/N.",
        "Now, with independent documents, we can use λ as a collection parameter that controls the average containment probability.",
        "We show through the next theorem that the upper bound of the noise probability depends on λ. Theorem 2.",
        "The upper bound of being noisy: If the occurrence P(t|d) is binary, and the containment P(d|c) is constant, and document containments are independent events, then 1 − e−λ is the upper bound of the noise probability. ∀t : Pin (t is noisy|c) < 1 − e−λ Proof.",
        "The upper bound of the independent noise probability follows from the limit limN→∞(1 + x N )N = ex (see any comprehensive math book, for example, [5], for the convergence equation of the Euler function).",
        "With x = −λ, we obtain: lim N→∞ 1 − λ N N = e−λ For the term noise, we have: Pin (t is noisy|c) = 1 − 1 − λ N n(t) Pin (t is noisy|c) is strictly monotonous: The noise of a term tn is less than the noise of a term tn+1, where tn occurs in n documents and tn+1 occurs in n + 1 documents.",
        "Therefore, a term with n = N has the largest noise probability.",
        "For a collection with infinite many documents, the upper bound of the noise probability for terms tN that occur in all documents becomes: lim N→∞ Pin (tN is noisy) = lim N→∞ 1 − 1 − λ N N = 1 − e−λ By applying an independence rather a disjointness assumption, we obtain the probability e−1 that a term is not noisy even if the term does occur in all documents.",
        "In the disjoint case, the noise probability is one for a term that occurs in all documents.",
        "If we view P(d|c) := λ/N as the average containment, then λ is large for a term that occurs mostly in large documents, and λ is small for a term that occurs mostly in small documents.",
        "Thus, the noise of a term t is large if t occurs in n(t) large documents and the noise is smaller if t occurs in small documents.",
        "Alternatively, we can assume a constant containment and a term-dependent occurrence.",
        "If we assume P(d|c) := 1, then P(t|d) := λ/N can be interpreted as the average probability that t represents a document.",
        "The common assumption is that the average containment or occurrence probability is proportional to n(t).",
        "However, here is additional potential: The statistical laws (see [3] on Luhn and Zipf) indicate that the average probability could follow a normal distribution, i. e. small probabilities for small n(t) and large n(t), and larger probabilities for medium n(t).",
        "For the monotonous case we investigate here, the noise of a term with n(t) = 1 is equal to 1 − (1 − λ/N) = λ/N and the noise of a term with n(t) = N is close to 1− e−λ .",
        "In the next section, we relate the value e−λ to information theory. 3.3 The probability of a maximal informative signal The probability e−1 is special in the sense that a signal with that probability is a signal with maximal information as derived from the entropy definition.",
        "Consider the definition of the entropy contribution H(t) of a signal t. H(t) := P(t) · − ln P(t) We form the first derivation for computing the optimum. ∂H(t) ∂P(t) = − ln P(t) + −1 P(t) · P(t) = −(1 + ln P(t)) For obtaining optima, we use: 0 = −(1 + ln P(t)) The entropy contribution H(t) is maximal for P(t) = e−1 .",
        "This result does not depend on the base of the logarithm as we see next: ∂H(t) ∂P(t) = − logb P(t) + −1 P(t) · ln b · P(t) = − 1 ln b + logb P(t) = − 1 + ln P(t) ln b We summarise this result in the following theorem: Theorem 3.",
        "The probability of a maximal informative signal: The probability Pmax = e−1 ≈ 0.37 is the probability of a maximal informative signal.",
        "The entropy of a maximal informative signal is Hmax = e−1 .",
        "Proof.",
        "The probability and entropy follow from the derivation above.",
        "The complement of the maximal noise probability is e−λ and we are looking now for a generalisation of the entropy definition such that e−λ is the probability of a maximal informative signal.",
        "We can generalise the entropy definition by computing the integral of λ+ ln P(t), i. e. this derivation is zero for e−λ .",
        "We obtain a generalised entropy: −(λ + ln P(t)) d(P(t)) = P(t) · (1 − λ − ln P(t)) The generalised entropy corresponds for λ = 1 to the classical entropy.",
        "By moving from disjoint to independent documents, we have established a link between the complement of the noise probability of a term that occurs in all documents and information theory.",
        "Next, we link independent documents to probability theory. 4.",
        "THE LINK TO PROBABILITY THEORY We review for independent documents three concepts of probability theory: possible worlds, binomial distribution and Poisson distribution. 4.1 Possible Worlds Each conjunction of document events (for each document, we consider two document events: the document can be true or false) is associated with a so-called possible world.",
        "For example, consider the eight possible worlds for three documents (N = 3). 230 world w conjunction w7 d1 ∧ d2 ∧ d3 w6 d1 ∧ d2 ∧ ¬d3 w5 d1 ∧ ¬d2 ∧ d3 w4 d1 ∧ ¬d2 ∧ ¬d3 w3 ¬d1 ∧ d2 ∧ d3 w2 ¬d1 ∧ d2 ∧ ¬d3 w1 ¬d1 ∧ ¬d2 ∧ d3 w0 ¬d1 ∧ ¬d2 ∧ ¬d3 With each world w, we associate a probability µ(w), which is equal to the product of the single probabilities of the document events. world w probability µ(w) w7  λ N ¡3 ·  1 − λ N ¡0 w6  λ N ¡2 ·  1 − λ N ¡1 w5  λ N ¡2 ·  1 − λ N ¡1 w4  λ N ¡1 ·  1 − λ N ¡2 w3  λ N ¡2 ·  1 − λ N ¡1 w2  λ N ¡1 ·  1 − λ N ¡2 w1  λ N ¡1 ·  1 − λ N ¡2 w0  λ N ¡0 ·  1 − λ N ¡3 The sum over the possible worlds in which k documents are true and N −k documents are false is equal to the probability function of the binomial distribution, since the binomial coefficient yields the number of possible worlds in which k documents are true. 4.2 Binomial distribution The binomial probability function yields the probability that k of N events are true where each event is true with the single event probability p. P(k) := binom(N, k, p) := N k pk (1 − p)N −k The single event probability is usually defined as p := λ/N, i. e. p is inversely proportional to N, the total number of events.",
        "With this definition of p, we obtain for an infinite number of documents the following limit for the product of the binomial coefficient and pk : lim N→∞ N k pk = = lim N→∞ N · (N −1) · . . . · (N −k +1) k! λ N k = λk k!",
        "The limit is close to the actual value for k << N. For large k, the actual value is smaller than the limit.",
        "The limit of (1−p)N −k follows from the limit limN→∞(1+ x N )N = ex . lim N→∞ (1 − p)N−k = lim N→∞ 1 − λ N N −k = lim N→∞ e−λ · 1 − λ N −k = e−λ Again, the limit is close to the actual value for k << N. For large k, the actual value is larger than the limit. 4.3 Poisson distribution For an infinite number of events, the Poisson probability function is the limit of the binomial probability function. lim N→∞ binom(N, k, p) = λk k! · e−λ P(k) = poisson(k, λ) := λk k! · e−λ The probability poisson(0, 1) is equal to e−1 , which is the probability of a maximal informative signal.",

                "With N being the total number of documents, and n(t) being the number of documents in which term t occurs, the idf is defined as follows: idf(t) := − log n(t) N , 0 <= idf(t) < ∞ Ranking based on the sum of the idf -values of the query terms that occur in the retrieved documents works well, this has been shown in numerous applications.",
                "Also, it is well known that the combination of a document-specific term weight and idf works better than idf alone.",
                "This approach is known as tf-idf , where tf(t, d) (0 <= tf(t, d) <= 1) is the so-called term frequency of term t in document d. The idf reflects the discriminating power (informativeness) of a term, whereas the tf reflects the occurrence of a term.",
                "The idf alone works better than the tf alone does.",
                "An explanation might be the problem of tf with terms that occur in many documents; let us refer to those terms as noisy terms.",
                "We use the notion of noisy terms rather than frequent terms since frequent terms leaves open whether we refer to the document frequency of a term in a collection or to the so-called term frequency (also referred to as withindocument frequency) of a term in a document.",

                "In a tf-idf approach, the removal of stopwords is conceptually obsolete, if stopwords are just words with a low idf .",
                "From a probabilistic point of view, tf is a value with a frequency-based probabilistic interpretation whereas idf has an informative rather than a probabilistic interpretation.",

                "In this background section, we focus on work that investigates the application of the Poisson distribution in IR since a main part of the work presented in this paper addresses the underlying assumptions of Poisson. [4] proposes a 2-Poisson model that takes into account the different nature of relevant and non-relevant documents, rare terms (content words) and frequent terms (noisy terms, function words, stopwords). [9] shows experimentally that most of the terms (words) in a collection are distributed according to a low dimension n-Poisson model. [10] uses a 2-Poisson model for including term frequency-based probabilities in the probabilistic retrieval model.",
                "The non-linear scaling of the Poisson function showed significant improvement compared to a linear frequency-based probability.",
                "The Poisson model was here applied to the term frequency of a term in a document.",
                "We will generalise the discussion by pointing out that document frequency and term frequency are dual parameters in the collection space and the document space, respectively.",
                "Our discussion of the Poisson distribution focuses on the document frequency in a collection rather than on the term frequency in a document. [7] and [6] address the deviation of idf and Poisson, and apply Poisson mixtures to achieve better Poisson-based estimates.",
                "The results proved again experimentally that a onedimensional Poisson does not work for rare terms, therefore Poisson mixtures and additional parameters are proposed. [3], section 3.3, illustrates and summarises comprehensively the relationships between frequencies, probabilities and Poisson.",

                "We use in our paper a different notion of noise: we consider a frequency-based noise that corresponds to the document frequency, and we consider a term noise that is based on the independence of document events. [11], [12], [8] and [1] link frequencies and probability estimation to information theory. [12] establishes a framework in which information retrieval models are formalised based on probabilistic inference.",
                "A key component is the use of a space of disjoint events, where the framework mainly uses terms as disjoint events.",
                "The probability of being informative defined in our paper can be viewed as the probability of the disjoint terms in the term space of [12]. [8] address entropy and bibliometric distributions.",

                "We restrict in this paper to the discussion of Poisson, however, our results show that indeed a smoother distribution than Poisson promises to be a good candidate for improving the estimation of probabilities in information retrieval. [1] establishes a theoretical link between tf-idf and information theory and the theoretical research on the meaning of tf-idf clarifies the statistical model on which the different measures are commonly based.",
                "This motivation matches the motivation of our paper: We investigate theoretically the assumptions of classical idf and Poisson for a better understanding of parameter estimation and combination. 3.",
                "FROM DISJOINT TO INDEPENDENT We define and discuss in this section three probabilities: The frequency-based noise probability (definition 1), the total noise probability for disjoint documents (definition 2). and the noise probability for independent documents (definition 3). 3.1 Binary occurrence, constant containment and disjointness of documents We show in this section, that the frequency-based noise probability n(t) N in the idf definition can be explained as a total probability with binary term occurrence, constant document containment and disjointness of document containments.",

                "We generalise this definition and introduce the constant λ where 0 ≤ λ ≤ N. The containment of a document d depends on the collection c, this is reflected by the notation P(d|c) used for the containment 228 of a document.",

                "IDF assumptions: If the occurrence probability P(t|d) of term t over documents d is binary, and the containment probability P(d|c) of documents d is constant, and document containments are disjoint events, then the noise probability for disjoint documents is equal to the frequency-based noise probability.",

                "The assumptions make explicit that the different types of term occurrence in documents (frequency of a term, importance of a term, position of a term, document part where the term occurs, etc.) and the different types of document containment (size, quality, age, etc.) are ignored, and document containments are considered as disjoint events.",
                "From the assumptions, we can conclude that idf (frequencybased noise, respectively) is a relatively simple but strict estimate.",
                "Still, idf works well.",
                "This could be explained by a leverage effect that justifies the binary occurrence and constant containment: The term occurrence for small documents tends to be larger than for large documents, whereas the containment for small documents tends to be smaller than for large documents.",
                "From that point of view, idf means that P(t ∧ d|c) is constant for all d in which t occurs, and P(t ∧ d|c) is zero otherwise.",

                "For example, set P(t∧d|c) = 1/ND(c) if t occurs in d, where ND(c) is the number of documents in collection c (we used before just N).",
                "We choose a document-dependent occurrence P(t|d) := 1/NT (d), i. e. the occurrence probability is equal to the inverse of NT (d), which is the total number of terms in document d. Next, we choose the containment P(d|c) := NT (d)/NT (c)·NT (c)/ND(c) where NT (d)/NT (c) is a document length normalisation (number of terms in document d divided by the number of terms in collection c), and NT (c)/ND(c) is a constant factor of the collection (number of terms in collection c divided by the number of documents in collection c).",

[4] proposes a 2-Poisson model that takes into account the different nature of relevant and non-relevant documents, rare terms (content words) and frequent terms (noisy terms, function words, stopwords). [9] shows experimentally that most of the terms (words) in a collection are distributed according to a low dimension n-Poisson model. [10] uses a 2-Poisson model for including term frequency-based probabilities in the probabilistic retrieval model.",

                "Our discussion of the Poisson distribution focuses on the document frequency in a collection rather than on the term frequency in a document. [7] and [6] address the deviation of idf and Poisson, and apply Poisson mixtures to achieve better Poisson-based estimates.",
                "The results proved again experimentally that a onedimensional Poisson does not work for rare terms, therefore Poisson mixtures and additional parameters are proposed. [3], section 3.3, illustrates and summarises comprehensively the relationships between frequencies, probabilities and Poisson.",

[11], [12], [8] and [1] link frequencies and probability estimation to information theory. [12] establishes a framework in which information retrieval models are formalised based on probabilistic inference.",
                "A key component is the use of a space of disjoint events, where the framework mainly uses terms as disjoint events.",

                "The assumptions make explicit that the different types of term occurrence in documents (frequency of a term, importance of a term, position of a term, document part where the term occurs, etc.) and the different types of document containment (size, quality, age, etc.) are ignored, and document containments are considered as disjoint events.",
                "From the assumptions, we can conclude that idf (frequencybased noise, respectively) is a relatively simple but strict estimate.",

[4] proposes a 2-Poisson model that takes into account the different nature of relevant and non-relevant documents, rare terms (content words) and frequent terms (noisy terms, function words, stopwords). [9] shows experimentally that most of the terms (words) in a collection are distributed according to a low dimension n-Poisson model. [10] uses a 2-Poisson model for including term frequency-based probabilities in the probabilistic retrieval model.",

[11], [12], [8] and [1] link frequencies and probability estimation to information theory. [12] establishes a framework in which information retrieval models are formalised based on probabilistic inference.",

                "Also, it is well known that the combination of a document-specific term weight and idf works better than idf alone.",
                "This approach is known as tf-idf , where tf(t, d) (0 <= tf(t, d) <= 1) is the so-called term frequency of term t in document d. The idf reflects the discriminating power (informativeness) of a term, whereas the tf reflects the occurrence of a term.",
                "The idf alone works better than the tf alone does.",
                "An explanation might be the problem of tf with terms that occur in many documents; let us refer to those terms as noisy terms.",

[4] proposes a 2-Poisson model that takes into account the different nature of relevant and non-relevant documents, rare terms (content words) and frequent terms (noisy terms, function words, stopwords). [9] shows experimentally that most of the terms (words) in a collection are distributed according to a low dimension n-Poisson model. [10] uses a 2-Poisson model for including term frequency-based probabilities in the probabilistic retrieval model.",

                "Our discussion of the Poisson distribution focuses on the document frequency in a collection rather than on the term frequency in a document. [7] and [6] address the deviation of idf and Poisson, and apply Poisson mixtures to achieve better Poisson-based estimates.",
                "The results proved again experimentally that a onedimensional Poisson does not work for rare terms, therefore Poisson mixtures and additional parameters are proposed. [3], section 3.3, illustrates and summarises comprehensively the relationships between frequencies, probabilities and Poisson.",

[11], [12], [8] and [1] link frequencies and probability estimation to information theory. [12] establishes a framework in which <br>information retrieval</br> models are formalised based on probabilistic inference.",

[1] establishes a theoretical link between tf-idf and information theory and the theoretical research on the meaning of tf-idf clarifies the statistical model on which the different measures are commonly based.",

[9] shows experimentally that most of the terms (words) in a collection are distributed according to a low dimension n-Poisson model.

[4] proposes a 2-Poisson model that takes into account the different nature of relevant and non-relevant documents, rare terms (content words) and frequent terms (noisy terms, function words, stopwords). [9] shows experimentally that most of the terms (words) in a collection are distributed according to a low dimension n-Poisson model. [10] uses a 2-Poisson model for including term frequency-based probabilities in the probabilistic retrieval model.",

[12] establishes a framework in which information retrieval models are formalised based on probabilistic inference.",

                "The assumptions make explicit that the different types of term occurrence in documents (frequency of a term, importance of a term, position of a term, document part where the term occurs, etc.) and the different types of document containment (size, quality, age, etc.) are ignored, and document containments are considered as disjoint events.",
                "From the assumptions, we can conclude that idf (frequencybased noise, respectively) is a relatively simple but strict estimate.",

                "Figure 1 shows a Poisson noise based on a two-dimensional Poisson: poisson(k, λ1, λ2) := π · e−λ1 · λk 1 k! + (1 − π) · e−λ2 · λk 2 k!",
                "The two dimensional Poisson shows a plateau between λ1 = 1000 and λ2 = 2000, we used here π = 0.5.",
                "The idea behind this setting is that terms that occur in less than 1000 documents are considered to be not noisy (i.e. they are informative), that terms between 1000 and 2000 are half noisy, and that terms with more than 2000 are definitely noisy.",
                "For the informativeness, we observe that the radical behaviour of Poisson is preserved.",
                "The plateau here is approximately at 1/6, and it is important to realise that this plateau is not obtained with the multi-dimensional Poisson noise using π = 0.5.",
                "The logarithm of the noise is normalised by the logarithm of a very small number, namely 0.5 · e−1000 + 0.5 · e−2000 .",
                "That is why the informativeness will be only close to one for very little noise, whereas for a bit of noise, informativeness will drop to zero.",
                "This effect can be controlled by using small values for π such that the noise in the interval [λ1; λ2] is still very little.",
                "The setting π = e−2000/6 leads to noise values of approximately e−2000/6 in the interval [λ1; λ2], the logarithms lead then to 1/6 for the informativeness.",
                "The indepence-based and frequency-based informativeness functions do not differ as much as the noise functions do.",
                "However, for the indepence-based probability of being informative, we can control the average informativeness by the definition p := λ/N whereas the control on the frequencybased is limited as we address next.",
                "For the frequency-based idf , the gradient is monotonously decreasing and we obtain for different collections the same distances of idf -values, i. e. the parameter N does not affect the distance.",
                "For an illustration, consider the distance between the value idf(tn+1) of a term tn+1 that occurs in n+1 documents, and the value idf(tn) of a term tn that occurs in n documents. idf(tn+1) − idf(tn) = ln n n + 1 The first three values of the distance function are: idf(t2) − idf(t1) = ln(1/(1 + 1)) = 0.69 idf(t3) − idf(t2) = ln(1/(2 + 1)) = 0.41 idf(t4) − idf(t3) = ln(1/(3 + 1)) = 0.29 For the Poisson-based informativeness, the gradient decreases first slowly for small n(t), then rapidly near n(t) ≈ λ and then it grows again slowly for large n(t).",
                "In conclusion, we have seen that the Poisson-based definition provides more control and parameter possibilities than 233 the frequency-based definition does.",
                "Whereas more control and parameter promises to be positive for the personalisation of retrieval systems, it bears at the same time the danger of just too many parameters.",

                "The parallel definitions of the frequency-based probability and the Poisson-based probability of being informative made the underlying assumptions explicit.",
                "The frequency-based probability can be explained by binary occurrence, constant containment and disjointness of documents.",
                "Independence of documents leads to Poisson, where we have to be aware that Poisson approximates the probability of a disjunction for a large number of events, but not for a small number.",
                "This theoretical result explains why experimental investigations on Poisson (see [7]) show that a Poisson estimation does work better for frequent (bad, noisy) terms than for rare (good, informative) terms.",
                "In addition to the collection-wide parameter setting, the framework presented here allows for document-dependent settings, as explained for the independence probability.",
                "This is in particular interesting for heterogeneous and structured collections, since documents are different in nature (size, quality, root document, sub document), and therefore, binary occurrence and constant containment are less appropriate than in relatively homogeneous collections. 7.",
                "SUMMARY The definition of the probability of being informative transforms the informative interpretation of the idf into a probabilistic interpretation, and we can use the idf -based probability in probabilistic retrieval approaches.",
                "We showed that the classical definition of the noise (document frequency) in the inverse document frequency can be explained by three assumptions: the term within-document occurrence probability is binary, the document containment probability is constant, and the document containment events are disjoint.",
                "By explicitly and mathematically formulating the assumptions, we showed that the classical definition of idf does not take into account parameters such as the different nature (size, quality, structure, etc.) of documents in a collection, or the different nature of terms (coverage, importance, position, etc.) in a document.",
                "We discussed that the absence of those parameters is compensated by a leverage effect of the within-document term occurrence probability and the document containment probability.",
                "By applying an independence rather a disjointness assumption for the document containment, we could establish a link between the noise probability (term occurrence in a collection), information theory and Poisson.",

                "The frequency-based probability is relatively smooth whereas the Poisson probability is radical in distinguishing between noisy or not noisy, and informative or not informative, respectively.",
                "We showed how to smoothen the radical behaviour of Poisson with a multidimensional Poisson.",
                "The explicit and mathematical formulation of idf - and Poisson-assumptions is the main result of this paper.",
                "Also, the paper emphasises the duality of idf and tf , collection space and document space, respectively.",
                "Thus, the result applies to term occurrence and document containment in a collection, and it applies to term occurrence and position containment in a document.",
