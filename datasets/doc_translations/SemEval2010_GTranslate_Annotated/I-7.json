Which commitments a player can make with credibility depends on the circumstances. In some, a player can only commit to the performance of an action, in others, he can commit himself conditionally on the actions of the other players. Some situations even allow for commitments on commitments or for commitments to randomized actions. We explore the formal properties of these types of (conditional) commitment and their interrelationships. So as to preclude inconsistencies among conditional commitments, we assume an order in which the players make their commitments. Central to our analyses is the notion of an extortion, which we define, for a given order of the players, as a profile that contains, for each player, an optimal commitment given the commitments of the players that committed earlier. On this basis, we investigate for different commitment types whether it is advantageous to commit earlier rather than later, and how the outcomes obtained through extortions relate to backward induction and Pareto efficiency.

INTRODUCTION On one view, the least one may expect of game theory is that it provides an answer to the question which actions maximize an agents expected utility in situations of interactive decision making. A slightly divergent view is expounded by Schelling when he states that strategy [. . . ] is not concerned with the efficient application of force but with the exploitation of potential force [9, page 5]. From this perspective, the formal model of a game in strategic form only outlines the strategic features of an interactive situation. Apart from merely choosing and performing an action from a set of actions, there may also be other courses open to an agent. E.g., the strategic lie of the land may be such that a promise, a threat, or a combination of both would be more conductive to his ends. The potency of a promise, however, essentially depends on the extent the promisee can be convinced of the promisers resolve to see to its fulfillment. Likewise, a threat only succeeds in deterring an agent if the latter can be made to believe that the threatener is bound to execute the threat, should it be ignored. In this sense, promises and threats essentially involve a commitment on the part of the one who makes them, thus purposely restricting his freedom of choice. Promises and threats epitomize one of the fundamental and at first sight perhaps most surprising phenomena in game theory: it may occur that a player can improve his strategic position by limiting his own freedom of action. By commitments we will understand such limitations of ones action space. Action itself could be seen as the ultimate commitment. Performing a particular action means doing so to the exclusion of all other actions. Commitments come in different forms and it may depend on the circumstances which ones can and which ones cannot credibly be made. Besides simply committing to the performance of an action, an agent might make his commitment conditional on the actions of other agents, as, e.g., the kidnapper does, when he promises to set free a hostage on receiving a ransom, while threatening to cut off another toe, otherwise. Some situations even allow for commitments on commitments or for commitments to randomized actions. By focusing on the selection of actions rather than on commitments, it might seem that the conception of game theory as mere interactive decision theory is too narrow. In this respect, Schellings view might seem to evince a more comprehensive understanding of what game theory tries to accomplish. One might object, that commitments could be seen as the actions of a larger game. In reply to this criticism Schelling remarks: While it is instructive and intellectually satisfying to see how such tactics as threats, commitments, and promises can be absorbed in an enlarged, abstract supergame (game in normal form), it should be emphasized that we cannot learn anything about those tactics by studying games that are already in normal form. [. . . ] What we want is a theory that systematizes the study of the various universal ingredients that make up the move-structure of games; too abstract a model will miss them. [9, pp. 156-7] 108 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS Our concern is with these commitment tactics, be it that our analysis is confined to situations in which the players can commit in a given order and where we assume the commitments the players can make are given. Despite Schellings warning for too abstract a framework, our approach will be based on the formal notion of an extortion, which we will propose in Section 4 as a uniform tactic for a comprehensive class of situations in which commitments can be made sequentially. On this basis we tackle such issues as the usefulness of certain types of commitment in different situations (strategic games) or whether it is better to commit early rather than late. We also provide a framework for the assessment of more general game theoretic matters like the relationship of extortions to backward induction or Pareto efficiency. Insight into these matters has proved itself invaluable for a proper understanding of diplomatic policy during the Cold War. Nowadays, we believe, these issues are equally significant for applications and developments in such fields as multiagent systems, distributed computing and electronic markets. For example, commitments have been argued to be of importance for interacting software agents as well as for mechanism design. In the former setting, the inability to re-program a software agent on the fly can be seen as a commitment to its specification and thus exploited to strengthen its strategic position in a multiagent setting. A mechanism, on the other hand, could be seen as a set of commitments that steers the players behavior in a certain desired way (see, e.g., [2]). Our analysis is conceptually similar to that of Stackelberg or leadership games [15], which have been extensively studied in the economic literature (cf., [16]). These games analyze situations in which a leader commits to a pure or mixed strategy, and a number of followers, who then act simultaneously. Our approach, however, differs in that it is assumed that the players all move in a particular order-first, second, third and so on-and that it is specifically aimed at incorporating a wide range of possible commitments, in particular conditional commitments. After briefly discussing related work in Section 2, we present the formal game theoretic framework, in which we define the notions of a commitment type as well as conditional and unconditional commitments (Section 3). In Section 4 we propose the generic concept of an extortion, which for each commitment type captures the idea of an optimal commitment profile. We point out an equivalence between extortions and backward induction solutions, and investigate whether it is advantageous to commit earlier rather than later and how the outcomes obtained through extortions relate to Pareto efficiency. Section 5 briefly reviews some other commitment types, such as inductive, mixed and mixed conditional commitments. The paper concludes with an overview of the results and an outlook for future research in Section 6. 2. RELATED WORK Commitment is a central concept in game theory. The possibility to make commitments distinguishes cooperative from noncooperative game theory [4, 6]. Leadership games, as mentioned in the introduction, analyze commitments to pure or mixed strategies in what is essentially a two-player setting [15, 16]. Informally, Schelling [9] has emphasized the importance of promises, threats and the like for a proper understanding of social interaction. On a more formal level, threats have also figured in bargaining theory. Nashs threat game [5] and Harsanyis rational threats [3] are two important early examples. Also, commitments have played a significant role in the theory of equilibrium selection (see, e.g., [13]. Over the last few years, game theory has become almost indispensable as a research tool for computer science and (multi)agent research. Commitments have by no means gone unnoticed (see, ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (1, 3) (3, 2) (0, 0) (2, 1) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ Figure 1: Committing to a dominated strategy can be advantageous. e.g., [1, 11]). Recently, also the strategic aspects of commitments have attracted the attention of computer scientists. Thus, Conitzer and Sandholm [2] have studied the computational complexity of computing the optimal strategy to commit to in normal form and Bayesian games. Sandholm and Lesser [8] employ levelled commitments for the design of multiagent systems in which contractual agreements are not fully binding. Another connection between commitments and computer science has been pointed out by Samet [7] and Tennenholtz [12]. Their point of departure is the observation that programs can be used to formulate commitments that are conditional on the programs of other systems. Our approach is similar to the Stackleberg setting in that we assume an order in which the players commit. We, however, consider a number of different commitment types, among which conditional commitments, and propose a generic solution concept. 3. COMMITMENTS By committing, an agent can improve his strategic position. It may even be advantageous to commit to a strategy that is strongly dominated, i.e., one for which there is another strategy that yields a better payoff no matter how the other agents act. Consider for example the 2×2 game in Figure 1, in which one player, Row, chooses rows and another, Col, chooses columns. The entries in the matrix indicate the payoffs to Row and Col, respectively. Then, top-left is the solution obtained by iterative elimination of strongly dominated strategies: for Row, playing top is always better than playing bottom, and assuming that Row will therefore never play bottom, left is always better than right for Col. However, if Row succeeds in convincing Col of his commitment to play bottom, the latter had better choose the right column. Thus, Row attains a payoff of two instead of one. Along a similar line of reasoning, however, Col would wish to commit to the left column, as convincing Row of this commitment guarantees him the most desirable outcome. If, on the other hand, both players actually commit themselves in this way but without convincing the other party of their having done so, the game ends in misery for both. Important types of commitments, however, cannot simply be analyzed as unconditional commitments to actions. The essence of a threat, for example, is deterrence. If successful, it is not carried out. (This is also the reason why the credibility of a threat is not necessarily undermined if its putting into effect means that the threatener is also harmed.) By contrast, promises are made to entice and, as such, meant to be fulfilled. Thus, both threats and promises would be strategically void if they were unconditional. Figure 2 shows an example, in which Col can guarantee himself a payoff of three by threatening to choose the right column if Row chooses top. (This will suffice to deter Row, and there is no need for an additional promise on the part of Col.) He cannot do so by merely committing unconditionally, and neither can Row if he were to commit first. In the case of conditional commitments, however, a particular kind of inconsistency can arise. It is not in general the case that any two commitments can both be credible. In a 2 × 2 game, it could occur that Row commits conditionally on playing top if the The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 109 ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (2, 2) (0, 0) (1, 3) (3, 1) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ Figure 2: The column player Col can guarantee himself a payoff of three by threatening to play right if the row player Row plays top. Col plays left, and bottom, otherwise. If now, Col simultaneously were able to commit to the conditional strategy to play right if Row plays top, and left, otherwise, there is no strategy profile that can be played without one of the players bluff being called. To get around this problem, one can write down conditional commitments in the form of rules and define appropriate fixed point constructions, as suggested by Samet [7] and Tennenholtz [12]. Since checking the semantic equivalence of two commitments (or commitment conditions) is undecidable in general, Tennenholtz bases his definition of program equilibrium on syntactic equivalence. We, by contrast, try to steer clear from fixed point constructions by assuming that the players make their commitment in a particular order. Each player can then make his commitments dependent on the actions of the players to commit after him, but not on the commitments of the players that committed before. On the issue how this order comes about we do not here enter. Rather, we assume it to be determined by the circumstances, which may force or permit some players to commit earlier and others later. We will find that it is not always beneficial to commit earlier than later or vice versa. Another point to heed is that we only consider the case in which the commitments are considered absolutely binding. We do not take into account commitments that can be violated. Intuitively, this could be understood as that the possibility of violation fatally undermines the credibility of the commitment. We also assume commitments to be complete, in the sense that they fully lay down a players behavior in all foreseeable circumstances. These assumptions imply that the outcome of the game is entirely determined by the commitments the players make. Although these might be implausible assumptions for some situations, we had better study the idealized case first, before tackling the complications of the more general case. To make these concepts formally precise, we first have to fix some notation. 3.1 Strategic Games A strategic game is a tuple (N, (Ai)i∈N, (ui)i∈N), where N = {1, . . . , n} is a finite set of players, Ai is a set of actions available to player i and ui a real-valued utility function for player i on the set of (pure) strategy profiles S = A1×· · ·×An. We call a game finite if for all players i the action set Ai is finite. A mixed strategy σi for a player i is a probability distribution over Ai. We write Σi for the set of mixed strategies available to player i, and Σ = Σ1 × · · · × Σn for the set of mixed strategy profiles. We further have σ(a) and σi(a) denote the probability of action a in mixed strategy profile σ or mixed strategy σi, respectively. In settings involving expected utility, we will generally assume that utility functions represent von Neumann-Morgenstern preferences. For a player i and (mixed) strategy profiles σ and τ we write σ i τ if ui (σ) ui (τ). 3.2 Conditional Commitments Relative to a strategic game (N, (Ai)i∈N, (ui)i∈N) and an ordering π = (π1, . . . , πn) of the players, we define the set Fπi of (pure) conditional commitments of a player πi as the set of functions from Aπ1 × · · · × Aπi−1 to Aπi . For π1 we have the set of conditional commitments coincide with Aπ1 . By a conditional commitment profile f we understand any combination of conditional commitments in Fπ1 × · · · × Fπn . Intuitively, π reflects the sequential order in which the players can make their commitments, with πn committing first, πn−1 second, and so on. Each player can condition his action on the actions of all players that are to commit after him. In this manner, each conditional commitment profile f can be seen to determine a unique strategy profile, denoted by f , which will be played if all players stick to their conditional commitments. More formally, the strategy profile f = (fπ1 , . . . , fπn ) for a conditional commitment profile f is defined inductively as fπ1 =df. fπ1 , fπi+1 =df. fπi+1 (fπ1 , . . . , fπi ). The sequence fπ1 , (fπ1 , fπ2 ), . . . , (fπ1 , . . . , fπn ) will be called the path of f . E.g., in the two-player game of Figure 2 and given the order (Row, Col), Row has two conditional commitments, top and bottom, which we will henceforth denote t and b. Col, on the other hand, has four conditional commitments, corresponding to the different functions mapping strategies of Row to those of Col. If we consider a conditional commitment f for Col such that f (t) = l and f (b) = r, then (t, f ) is a conditional commitment profile and (t, f ) = (t, f (t)) = (t, l). There is a natural way in which a strategic game G together with an ordering (π1, . . . , πn) of the players can be interpreted as an extensive form game with perfect information (see, e.g., [4, 6])1 , in which π1 chooses his action first, π2 second, and so on. Observe that under this assumption the strategies in the extensive form game and the conditional commitments in the strategic game G with ordering π are mathematically the same objects. Applying backward induction to the extensive form game yields subgame perfect equilibria, which arguably provide appropriate solutions in this setting. From the perspective of conditional commitments, however, players move in reverse order. We will argue that under this interpretation other strategy profiles should be singled out as appropriate. To illustrate this point, consider once more the game in Figure 2 and observe that neither player can improve on the outcome obtained via iterated strong dominance by committing unconditionally to some strategy. Situations like this, in which players can make unconditional commitments in a fixed order, can fruitfully be analyzed as extensive form games, and the most lucrative unconditional commitment can be found through backward induction. Figure 3 shows the extensive form associated with the game of Figure 2. The strategies available to the row player are the same as in the strategic form: choosing the top or the bottom row. The strategies for the column player in the extensive game are given by the four functions that map strategies of the row player in the strategic game to one of his own. Transforming this extensive form back into a strategic game (see Figure 4), we find that there exists a second equilibrium besides the one found by means of backward induction. This equilibrium with outcome (1, 3), indicated by the thick lines in Figure 3, has been argued to be unacceptable in the sequential game as it would involve an incredible threat by Col: once Row has played top, Col finds himself confronted with a fait accompli. He had better make the best of a bad bargain and opt for the left column after all. This is in essence the line of thought Selten followed in his famous argument for subgame perfect equilibria [10]. If, however, the strategies of Col in the extensive form are thought of as his conditional commitments he can make in case 1 For a formal definition of a game in extensive form, the reader consult one of the standard textbooks, such as [4] or [6]. In this paper all formal definitions are based on strategic games and orderings of the players only. 110 The Sixth Intl.

The backward induction solution is indicated by dashed lines, the conditional commitment solution by solid ones. (The horizontal dotted lines do not indicate information sets, but merely indicate which players are to move when.) he moves first, the situation is radically different. Thus we also assume that it is possible for Col to make credible the threat to choose the right column if Row were to play top, so as to ensure the latter is always better off to play the bottom row. If Col can make a conditional commitment of playing the right column if Row chooses top, and the left column otherwise, this leaves Row with the easy choice between a payoff of zero or one, and Col may expect a payoff of three. This line of reasoning can be generalized to yield an algorithm for finding optimal conditional commitments for general twoplayer games: 1. Find a strategy profile s = (sπ1 , sπ2 ) with maximum payoff to player π2, and set fπ1 = sπ1 and fπ2 (sπ1 ) = sπ2 . 2. For each tπ1 ∈ Aπ1 with tπ1 sπ1 , find a strategy tπ2 ∈ Aπ2 that minimizes uπ1 (tπ1 , tπ2 ), and set fπ2 (tπ1 ) = tπ2 . 3. If uπ1 (tπ1 , fπ2 (tπ1 )) uπ1 (sπ1 , sπ2 ) for all tπ1 sπ1 , return f . 4. Otherwise, find the strategy profile (sπ1 , sπ2 ) with the highest payoff to π2 among the ones that have not yet been considered. Set fπ1 = sπ1 and fπ2 (sπ1 ) = sπ2 , and continue with Step 2. Generalizing the idea underlying this algorithm, we present in Section 4 the concept of an extortion, which applies to games with any number of players. For any order of the players an extortion contains, for each player, an optimal commitment given the commitments of the players that committed earlier. 3.3 Commitment Types So far, we have distinguished between conditional and unconditional commitments. If made sequentially, both of them determine a unique strategy profile in a given strategic game. This notion of sequential commitment allows for generalization and gives rise to the following definition of a (sequential) commitment type. Definition 3.1. (Sequential commitment type) A (sequential) commitment type τ associates with each strategic game G and each ordering π of its players, a tuple Xπ1 , . . . , Xπn , φ , where Xπ1 , . . . , Xπn are (abstract) sets of commitments and φ is a function mapping each profile in X = Xπ1 × · · · × Xπn to a (mixed) strategy profile of G. A commitment type Xπ1 , . . . , Xπn , φ is finite whenever Xπi is finite for each i with 1 i n. Thus, the type of unconditional commitments associates with a game and an ordering π of its players the tuple S π1 , . . . , S πn , id , ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (2, 2) (2, 2) (0, 0) (0, 0) (1, 3) (3, 1) (1, 3) (3, 1) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ Figure 4: The strategic game corresponding to the extensive form of Figure 3 where id is the identity function. Similarly, Fπ1 , . . . , Fπn , is the tuple associated with the same game by the type of (pure) conditional commitments. 4. EXTORTIONS In the introduction, we argued informally how players could improve their position by conditionally committing. How well they can do, could be analyzed by means of an extensive game with the actions of each player being defined as the possible commitments he can make. Here, we introduce for each commitment type a corresponding notion of extortion, which is defined relative to a strategic game and an ordering of the players. Extortions are meant to capture the concept of a profile that contains, for each player, an optimal commitment given the commitments of the players that committed earlier. A complicating factor is that in finding a players optimal commitment, one should not only take into account how such a commitment affects other players actions, but also how it enables them to make their commitments. Definition 4.1. (Extortions) Let G be a strategic game, π an ordering of its players, and τ a commitment type. Let τ(G, π) be given by Xπ1 , . . . , Xπn , φ . A τ-extortion of order 0 is any commitment profile x ∈ Xπ1 × · · · × Xπn . For m > 0, a commitment profile x ∈ Xπ1 × · · · × Xπn is a τ-extortion of order m in G given π if x is an τ-extortion of order m − 1 with φ yπ1 , . . . , yπm , xπm+1 , . . . , xπn πm φ xπ1 , . . . , xπm , xπm+1 , . . . , xπn for all commitment profiles g in X with (yπ1 , . . . , yπm , xπm+1 , . . . , xπn ) a τ-extortion of order m − 1. A τ-extortion is a commitment profile that is a τ-extortion of order m for all m with 0 m n. Furthermore, we say that a (mixed) strategy profile σ is τ-extortionable if there is some τ-extortion x with φ(x) = s. Thus, an extortion of order 1 is a commitment profile in which player π1, makes a commitment that maximizes his payoff, given fixed commitments of the other players. An extortion of order m is an extortion of order m − 1 that maximizes player ms payoff, given fixed commitments of the players πm+1 through πn. For the type of conditional commitments we have that any conditional commitment profile f is an extortion of order 0 and an extortion of an order m greater than 0 is any extortion of order m − 1 for which: gπ1 , . . . , gπm , fπm+1 , . . . , fπn πm fπ1 , . . . , fπm , fπm+1 , . . . , fπn , for each conditional commitment profile g such that gπ1 , . . . , gπm , fπm+1 , . . . , fπn an extortion of order m − 1. To illustrate the concept of an extortion for conditional commitments consider the three-player game in Figure 5 and assume ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (1, 4, 0) (1, 4, 0) (3, 3, 2) (0, 0, 2) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (4, 1, 1) (4, 0, 0) (3, 3, 2) (0, 0, 2) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ Figure 5: A three-player strategic game The Sixth Intl.

(Row, Col, Mat) to be the order in which the players commit. Figure 6 depicts the possible conditional commitments of the players in extensive forms, with the left branch corresponding to Rows strategy of playing the top row. Let f and g be the conditional commitment strategies indicated by the thick lines in the left and right figures respectively. Both f and g are extortions of order 1. In both f and g Row guarantees himself the higher payoff given the conditional commitments of Mat and Col. Only g, however, is also an extortion of order 2. To appreciate that f is not, consider the conditional commitment profile h in which Row chooses top and Col chooses right no matter how Row decides, i.e., h is such that hRow = t and hCol(t) = hCol(b) = r. Then, (hRow, hCol, fMat) is also an extortion of order 1, but yields Col a higher payoff than f does. We leave it to the reader to check that, by contrast, g is an extortion of order 3, and therewith an extortion per se. 4.1 Promises and Threats One way of understanding conditional extortions is by conceiving of them as combinations of precisely one promise and a number of threats. From the strategy profiles that can still be realized given the conditional commitments of players that have committed before him, a player tries to enforce the strategy profile that yields him as much payoff as possible. Hence, he chooses his commitment so as to render deviations from the path that leads to this strategy profile as unattractive as possible (threats) and the desired strategy profile as appealing as possible (promises) for the relevant players. If (sπ1 , . . . , sπn ) is such a desirable strategy profile for player πi and fπi his conditional commitment, the value of fπi (sπ1 , . . . , sπi−1 ) could be taken as his promise, whereas the values of fπi for all other (tπ1 , . . . , tπi−1 ) could be seen as constituting his threats. The higher the payoff is to the other players in a strategy profile a player aims for, the easier it is for him to formulate an effective threat. However, making appropriate threats in this respect does not merely come down to minimizing the payoffs to players to commit later wherever possible. A player should also take into account the commitments, promises and threats the following players can make on the basis of his and his predecessors commitments. This is what makes extortionate reasoning sometimes so complicated, especially in situations with more than two players. For example, in the game of Figure 5, there is no conditional extortion that ensures Mat a payoff of two. To appreciate this, consider the possible commitments Mat can make in case Row plays top and Col plays left (tl) and in case Row plays top and Col plays right (tr). If Mat commits to the right matrix in both cases, he virtually promises Row a payoff of four, leaving himself with a payoff of at most one. Otherwise, he puts Col in a position to deter Row from choosing bottom by threatening to choose the right column if the latter does so. Again, Mat cannot expect a payoff higher than one. In short, no matter how Mat conditionally commits, he will either enable Col to threaten Row into playing top or fail to lure Row into playing the bottom row. 4.2 Benign Backward Induction The solutions extortions provide can also be obtained by modeling the situation as an extensive form game and applying a backward inductive type of argument. The actions of the players in any such extensive form game are then given by their conditional commitments, which they then choose sequentially. For higher types of commitment, such as conditional commitments, such metagames, however, grow exponentially in the number of strategies available to the players and are generally much larger than the original game. The correspondence between the backward induction solutions in the meta-game and the extortions of the original strategic game rather signifies that the concept of an extortion is defined properly. First we define the concept of benign backward induction in general relative to a game in strategic form together with an ordering of the players. Intuitively it reflects the idea that each player chooses for each possible combination of actions of his predecessors the action that yields the highest payoff, given that his successors do similarly. The concept is called benign backward induction, because it implies that a player, when indifferent between a number of actions, chooses the one that benefits his predecessors most. For an ordering π of the players, we have πR denote its reversal (πn, . . . , π1). Definition 4.2. (Benign backward induction) Let G be a strategic game and π an ordering of its players. A benign backward induction of order 0 is any conditional commitment profile f subject to π. For m > 0, a conditional commitment strategy profile f is a benign backward induction (solution) of order m if f is a benign backward induction of order m − 1 and (gπR n , . . . , gπR m+1 , gπR m , . . . , gπR 1 ) πR m (gπR n , . . . , gπR m+1 , fπR m , . . . , fπR 1 ) for any backward induction (gπR n ,..., gπR m+1 , gπR m ,..., gπR 1 ) of order m−1. A conditional commitment profile f is a benign backward induction if it is a benign backward induction of order k for each k with 0 k n. For games with a finite action set for each player, the following result follows straightforwardly from Kuhns Theorem (cf. [6, p. 99]). In particular, this result holds if the players actions are commitments of a finite type. Fact 4.3. For each finite game and each ordering of the players, benign backward inductions exist. For each game, each ordering of its players and each commitment type, we can define another game G∗ with the the actions of each player i given by his τ-commitments Xi in G. The utility 112 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) of a strategy profile (xπ1 , . . . , xπn ) for a player i in G∗ can then be equated to his utility of the strategy profile φ(xπn , . . . , xπ1 ) in G. We now find that the extortions of G can be retrieved as the paths of the benign backward induction solutions of the game G∗ for the ordering πR of the players, provided that the commitment type is finite. Theorem 4.4. Let G = (N, (Ai)i∈N, (ui)i∈N) be a game and π an ordering of its players with which the finite commitment type τ associates the tuple Xπ1 , . . . , Xπn , φ . Let further G∗ = N, (Xπi )i∈N, (u∗ πi )i∈N , where u∗ πi (xπn , . . . , xπ1 ) = uπi (φ(xπ1 , . . . , xπn )), for each τ-commitment profile (xπ1 , . . . , xπn ). Then, a πcommitment profile (xπ1 , . . . , xπn ) is a τ-extortion in G given π if and only if there is some benign backward induction f in G∗ given πR with f = (xπn , . . . , xπ1 ). Proof. Assume that f is a benign backward induction in G∗ relative to πR . Then, f = (xπn , . . . , xπ1 ), for some commitment profile (xπ1 , . . . , xπn ) of G relative to π. We show by induction that (xπ1 , . . . , xπn ) is an extortion of order m, for all m with 0 m n. For m = 0, the proof is trivial. For the induction step, consider an arbitrary commitment profile (yπ1 , . . . , yπn ) such that (yπ1 , . . . , yπm , xπm+1 , . . . , xπn ) is an extortion of order m − 1. In virtue of the induction hypothesis, there is a benign backward induction g of order m − 1 in G∗ with g = (xπn , . . . , xπm+1 , yπm , . . . , yπ1 ). As f is also a benign backward induction of order m: (gπn , . . . , gπ1 ) ∗ πm (gπn , . . . , gπm+1 , fπm , . . . , fπ1 ) . Hence, (xπn , . . . , xπm+1 , yπm , . . . , yπ1 ) ∗ πm (xπn , . . . , xπ1 ). By definition of u∗ πm , then also: φ(yπ1 , . . . , yπm , xπm+1 , . . . , xπn ) πm φ(xπ1 , . . . , xπn ). We may conclude that x is an extortion of order m. For the only if direction, assume that x is an extortion of G given π. We prove that there is a benign backward induction f (∗) in G∗ for πR with f (∗) = x. In virtue of Fact 4.3, there is a benign backward induction h in G∗ given πR . Now define f (∗) in such a way that f (∗) πi (zπn , . . . , zπi−1 ) = xπi , if (zπn , . . . , zπi−1 ) = (xπn , . . . , xπi−1 ), and f (∗) πi (zπn , . . . , zπi−1 ) = hπi (zπn , . . . , zπi−1 ), otherwise. We prove by induction on m, that f (∗) is a benign backward induction of order m, for each m with 0 m n. The basis is trivial. So assume that f (∗) is a backward induction of order m − 1 in G∗ given πR and consider an arbitrary benign backward induction g of order m − 1 in G∗ given πR . Let g be given by (yπn , . . . , yπ1 ). Either (yπn , . . . , yπm+1 ) = (xπn , . . . , xπm+1 ), or this is not the case. If the latter, it can readily be appreciated that: (gπn , . . . , gπm+1 , f (∗) πm , . . . , f (∗) π1 ) = (gπn , . . . , gπm+1 , hπm , . . . , hπ1 ) . Having assumed that h is a benign backward induction, subsequently, (gπn , . . . , gπ1 ) ∗ m (gπn , . . . , gπm+1 , hπm , . . . , hπ1 ) , and (gπn , . . . , gπ1 ) ∗ m (gπn , . . . , gπm+1 , f (∗) πm , . . . , f (∗) π1 ) . Hence, f (∗) is a benign backward induction of order m. In the former case the reasoning is slightly different. Then, (gπn , . . . , gπ1 ) = (xπn , . . . , xπm+1 , yπm , . . . , yπ1 ). It follows that: (gπn , . . . , gπm+1 , f (∗) πm , . . . , f (∗) π1 ) = (f (∗) πn , . . . , f (∗) π1 ) = (xπn , . . . , xπ1 ). In virtue of the induction hypothesis, (yπ1 , . . . , yπn ) is an extortion of order m − 1 in G given π. As the reasoning takes place under the assumption that x is an extortion in G given π, we also have: φ(yπ1 , . . . , yπm , xπm+1 , . . . , xπn ) πm φ(xπ1 , . . . , xπn ). Then, (xπn , . . . , xπm+1 , yπm , . . . , yπ1 , ) ∗ πm (xπn , . . . , xπ1 )., by definition of u∗ . We may conclude that: (gπn , . . . , gπ1 ) ∗ πm (gπn , . . . , gπm+1 , f (∗) πm , . . . , f (∗) π1 ) , signifying that f (∗) is a benign backward induction of order m. As an immediate consequence of Theorem 4.4 and Fact 4.3 we also have the following result. Corollary 4.5. Let τ be a finite commitment type. Then, τ-extortions exist for each strategic game and for each ordering of the players. 4.3 Commitment Order In the case of unconditional commitments, it is not always favorable to be the first to commit. This is well illustrated by the familiar game rock-paper-scissors. If, on the other hand, the players are in a position to make conditional commitments in this particular game, moving first is an advantage. Rather, we find that it can never harm to move first in a two-player game with conditional commitments. Theorem 4.6. Let G be a two-player strategic game involving player i. Further let f be an extortion of G in which i commits first, and g an extortion in which i commits second. Then, g i f . Proof sketch. Let f be a conditional extortion in G given π. It suffices to show that there is some conditional extortion h of order 1 in G given π with h = f . Assume for a contradiction that there is no such extortion of order 1 in G given π . Then there must be some b∗ ∈ Aj such that f ≺j b∗ , a , for all a ∈ Ai. (Otherwise we could define (gj, gi) such that gj = fj(fi), gi(gj) = fi, and for any other b ∈ Aj, gi(b) = a∗ , where a∗ is an action in Ai such that (b, a∗ ) j f . Then g would be an extortion of order 1 in G given π with g .) Now consider a conditional commitment profile h for G and π such that hj(a) = b∗ , for all a ∈ Ai. Let further hi be such that (a, hj) i (hi, hj) , for all a ∈ Ai. Then, h is an extortion of order 1 in G given π. Observe that (hi, hj) = (fi , b∗ ). Hence, f ≺j h , contradicting the assumption that f is an extortion in G given π. Theorem 4.6 does not generalize to games with more than two players. Consider the three-player game in Figure 7, with extensive forms as in Figure 8. Here, Row and Mat have identical preferences. The latters extortionate powers relative Col, however, are very weak if he is to commit first: any conditional commitment he makes puts Col in a situation in which she can enforce a payoff of two, leaving Mat and Row in the cold with a payoff of one. However, if Mat is last to commit and Row first, then the latter can exploit his strategic powers, threaten Col so that she plays left, and guarantee both himself and Mat a payoff of two. 4.4 Pareto Efficiency Another issue concerns the Pareto efficiency of the strategy profiles extortionable through conditional commitments. We say that a strategy profile s (weakly) Pareto dominates another strategy profile t if t i s for all players i and s it for some. Moreover, a strategy profile s is (weakly) Pareto efficient if it is not (weakly) Pareto dominated by any other strategy profile. We extend this terminology to conditional commitment profiles by saying that a conditional commitment profile f is (weakly) Pareto efficient or (weakly) Pareto dominates another conditional commitment profile if f is or does so. We now have the following result. ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (0, 1, 0) (0, 0, 0) (0, 0, 0) (1, 2, 1) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (2, 1, 2) (0, 0, 0) (0, 0, 0) (1, 2, 1) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ Figure 7: A three-person game. The Sixth Intl.

Theorem 4.7. In each game, Pareto efficient conditional extortions exist. Moreover, any strategy profile that Pareto dominates an extortion is also extortionable through a conditional commitment. Proof sketch. Since, in virtue of Fact 4.5, extortions generally exists in each game, it suffices to recognize that the second claim holds. Let s be the strategy profile (sπ1 , . . . , sπn ). Let further the conditional extortion f be Pareto dominated by s. An extortion g with g = s can then be constructed by adopting all threats of f while promising g . I.e., for all players πi we have gπi (sπ1 , . . . , sπi−1 ) = si and gπi (tπ1 , . . . , tπn ) = fπi (tπ1 , . . . , tπn ), for all other tπ1 , . . . , tπn . As s Pareto dominates f , the threats of f remain effective as threats of g given that s is being promised. This result hints at a difference between (benign) backward induction and extortions. In general, solutions of benign backward inductions can be Pareto dominated by outcomes that are no benign backward induction solutions. Therefore, although every extortion can be seen as a benign backward induction in a larger game, it is not the case that all formal properties of extortions are shared by benign backward inductions in general. 5. OTHER COMMITMENT TYPES Conditional and unconditional commitments are only two possible commitment types. The definition also provides for types of commitment that allow for committing on commitments, thus achieving a finer adjustment of promises and threats. Similarly, it subsumes commitments on and to mixed strategies. In this section we comment on some of these possibilities. 5.1 Inductive Commitments Apart from making commitments conditional on the actions of the players to commit later, one could also commit on the commitments of the following players. Informally, such commitments would have the form of if you only dare to commit in such and such a way, then I do such and such, otherwise I promise to act so and so. For a strategic game G and an ordering π of the players, we define the inductive commitments of the players inductively. The inductive commitments available to π1 coincide with the actions that are available to him. An inductive commitment for player πi+1 is a function mapping each profile of inductive commitments of players π1 through πi to one of his basic actions. Formally we define the type of inductive commitments Fπ1 , . . . , Fπn , such that for each player πi in a game G and given π: Fπ1 =df. Aπ1 , Fπi+1 =df. A Fπ1 ×···×Fπi πi+1 . Let fπi = fπi fπ1 , . . . , fπi−1 , for each player πi and have f denote the pure strategy profile fπ1 , . . . , fπn . Inductive commitments have a greater extortionate power than conditional commitments. To appreciate this, consider once more the game in Figure 5. We found that the strategy profile in which Row chooses bottom and Col and Mat both choose left is not extortionable through conditional commitments. By means of inductive commitments, however, this is possible. Let f be the inductive commitment profile such that fRow is Row choosing the bottom row (b), fCol is the column player choosing the left column (l) no matter how Row decides, and fMat is defined such that: fMat fRow, fCol = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ r if fRow = t and fCol (b) = r, l otherwise. Instead of showing formally that f is an inductive extortion of the strategy profile (b, l, l), we point out informally how this can be done. We argued that in order to exact a payoff of two by means of a conditional extortion, Mat would have to lure Row into choosing the bottom row without at the same time putting Col in a position to successfully threaten Row not to choose top. This, we found, is an impossibility if the players can only make conditional commitments. By contrast, if Mat can commit to commitments, he can undermine Cols efforts to threaten Row by playing the right matrix, if Col were to do so. Yet, Mat can still force Row to choose the bottom row, in case Col desists form making this threat. As can readily be observed, in any game, the inductive commitments of the first two players to commit coincide with their conditional commitments. Hence, as an immediate consequence of Theorem 4.6, it can never harm to be the first to commit to an inductive commitment in the two player case. Similarly, we find that the game depicted in Figure 7 also serves as an example showing that, in case there are more than two players, it is not always better to commit to an inductive commitment early. In this example the strategic position of Mat is so weak if he is to commit first, that even the possibility to commit inductively does not strengthen it, whereas, in a similar fashion as with conditional commitments, Row can enforce a payoff of two to both himself and Mat if he is the first to commit. 5.2 Mixed Commitments Types So far we have merely considered commitments to and on pure strategies. A natural extension would be also to consider commitments to and on mixed strategies. We distinguish between conditional, unconditional as well as inductive mixed commitments. We find that they are generally quite incomparable with their pure counterparts: in some situations a player can achieve more using a mixed commitment, in another using a pure commitment type. A complicating factor with mixed commitment types is that they 114 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) can result in a mixed strategy profile being played. This makes that the distinction between promises and threats, as delineated in Section 4.1, gets blurred for mixed commitment types. The type of mixed unconditional commitments associates with each game G and ordering π of its players the tuple Σπ1 , . . . , Σπn , id . The two-player case has been extensively studied (e.g., [2, 16]). As a matter of fact, von Neumanns famous minimax theorem shows that for two-player zero-sum games, it does not matter which player commits first. If the second player to commit plays a mixed strategy that ensures his security level, the first player to commit can do no better than to do so as well [14]. In the game of Figure 5 we found that, with conditional commitments, Mat is unable to enforce an outcome that awards him a payoff of two. Recall that the reason of this failure is that any effort to deter Row from choosing the top row is flawed, as it would put Col in an excellent position to threaten Row not to choose the bottom row. If Mat has inductive commitments at his disposal, however, this is a possibility. We now find that in case the players can dispose of unconditional mixed strategies, Mat is in a much similar position. He could randomize uniformly between the left and right matrix. Then, Rows expected utility is 21 2 if he plays the top row, no matter how Col randomizes. The expected payoff of Col does not exceed 21 2 , either, in case Row chooses top. By purely committing to the left column, Col player entices Row to play bottom, as his expected utility then amounts to 3. This ensures an expected utility of three for Col as well. However, a player is not always better off with unconditional mixed commitments than with pure conditional commitments. For an example, consider the game in Figure 2. Using pure conditional commitments, he can ensure a payoff of three, whereas with unconditional mixed commitments 21 2 would be the most he could achieve. Neither is it in general advantageous to commit first to a mixed strategy in a three-player game. To appreciate this, consider once more the game in Figure 7. Again committing to a mixed strategy will not achieve much for Mat if he is to move first, and as before the other players have no reason to commit to anything other than a pure strategy. This holds for all players if Row commits first, Col second and Mat last, be it that in this case Mat obtains the best payoff he can get. Analogous to conditional and inductive commitments one can also define the types of mixed conditional and mixed inductive commitments. With the former, a player can condition his mixed strategies on the mixed strategies of the players to commit after him. These tend to be very large objects and, knowing little about them yet, we shelve their formal analysis for future research. Conceptually, it might not be immediately clear how such mixed conditional commitments can be made with credibility. For one, when ones commitments are conditional on a particular mixed strategy being played, how can it be recognized that it was in fact this mixed strategy that was played rather than another one? If this proves to be impossible, how can one know how his conditional commitments is to be effectuated? A possible answer would be, that all depends on the circumstances in which the commitments were made. E.g., if the different agents can submit their mixed conditional commitments to an independent party, the latter can execute the randomizations and determine the unique mixed strategy profile that their commitments induce. 6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION In some situations agents can strengthen their strategic position by committing themselves to a particular course of action. There are various types of commitment, e.g., pure, mixed and conditional. Which type of commitment an agent is in a position in to make essentially depends on the situation under consideration. If the agents commit in a particular order, there is a tactic common to making commitments of any type, which we have formalized by means the concept of an extortion. This generic concept of extortion can be analyzed in abstracto. Moreover, on its basis the various commitment types can be compared formally and systematically. We have seen that the type of commitment an agent can make has a profound impact on what an agent can achieve in a gamelike situation. In some situations a player is much helped if he is in a position to commit conditionally, whereas in others mixed commitments would be more profitable. This raises the question as to the characteristic formal features of the situations in which it is advantageous for a player to be able to make commitments of a particular type. Another issue which we leave for future research is the computational complexity of finding an extortion for the different commitment types. 7. REFERENCES [1] A. K. Chopra and M. Singh.

Introducción En un punto de vista, lo menos que uno puede esperar de la teoría del juego es que proporciona una respuesta a la pregunta que las acciones maximizan la utilidad de los agentes esperados en situaciones de toma de decisiones interactivas. Schelling expone una visión ligeramente divergente cuando establece esa estrategia [...] no se refiere a la aplicación eficiente de la fuerza sino por la explotación de la fuerza potencial [9, página 5]. Desde esta perspectiva, el modelo formal de un juego en forma estratégica solo describe las características estratégicas de una situación interactiva. Además de simplemente elegir y realizar una acción de un conjunto de acciones, también puede haber otros cursos abiertos a un agente. Por ejemplo, la mentira estratégica de la tierra puede ser tal que una promesa, una amenaza o una combinación de ambos serían más conductivas para sus fines. Sin embargo, la potencia de una promesa depende esencialmente de la medida en que el prometido pueda ser convencido de la resolución de los prometedores para ver su cumplimiento. Del mismo modo, una amenaza solo tiene éxito en disuadir a un agente si se puede hacer creer este último que el amenazador está obligado a ejecutar la amenaza, si se ignora. En este sentido, las promesas y amenazas implican esencialmente un compromiso por parte de quien los hace, lo que restringe a propósito su libertad de elección. Las promesas y amenazas personifican uno de los fenómenos fundamentales y a primera vista quizás más sorprendentes en la teoría del juego: puede ocurrir que un jugador pueda mejorar su posición estratégica al limitar su propia libertad de acción. Por compromisos comprenderemos tales limitaciones del espacio de acción. La acción misma podría verse como el mejor compromiso. Realizar una acción particular significa hacerlo con la exclusión de todas las demás acciones. Los compromisos vienen en diferentes formas y pueden depender de las circunstancias que pueden y cuáles no se pueden hacer de manera creíble. Además de simplemente comprometerse con el desempeño de una acción, un agente podría hacer que su compromiso sea condicionado a las acciones de otros agentes, como, por ejemplo, el secuestrador lo hace, cuando promete liberar a un rehén al recibir un rescate, mientras amenaza con cortarotro dedo del pie, de lo contrario. Algunas situaciones incluso permiten compromisos sobre compromisos o compromisos con acciones aleatorias. Al centrarse en la selección de acciones más que en los compromisos, podría parecer que la concepción de la teoría del juego como mera teoría de decisión interactiva es demasiado estrecha. A este respecto, Schellings View puede parecer una comprensión más completa de lo que la teoría del juego intenta lograr. Uno podría objetar que los compromisos podrían verse como las acciones de un juego más grande. En respuesta a esta crítica, Schelling comenta: Si bien es instructivo e intelectualmente satisfactorio ver cómo tácticas como las amenazas, los compromisos y las promesas pueden ser absorbidas en un supergame abstracto y ampliado (juego en forma normal), debe enfatizarse que no podemosAprenda cualquier cosa sobre esas tácticas estudiando juegos que ya están en forma normal.[...] Lo que queremos es una teoría que sistematiza el estudio de los diversos ingredientes universales que constituyen la estructura de movimiento de los juegos;Demasiado abstracto Un modelo los extrañará.[9, pp. 156-7] 108 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 Ifaamas Nuestra preocupación es con estas tácticas de compromiso, ya sea que nuestro análisis se limita a situaciones en las que los jugadores pueden comprometerse en unorden dado y donde asumimos los compromisos que los jugadores pueden hacer. A pesar de la advertencia de Schellings para un marco demasiado abstracto, nuestro enfoque se basará en la noción formal de una extorsión, que propondremos en la Sección 4 como una táctica uniforme para una clase integral de situaciones en las que se pueden hacer compromisos secuencialmente. Sobre esta base, abordamos temas como la utilidad de ciertos tipos de compromiso en diferentes situaciones (juegos estratégicos) o si es mejor comprometerse temprano en lugar de tarde. También proporcionamos un marco para la evaluación de asuntos teóricos del juego más generales, como la relación de las extortiones con la inducción atrasada o la eficiencia de Pareto. La visión de estos asuntos ha demostrado ser invaluable para una comprensión adecuada de la política diplomática durante la Guerra Fría. Hoy en día, creemos que estos problemas son igualmente significativos para aplicaciones y desarrollos en campos tales como sistemas multiagentes, computación distribuida y mercados electrónicos. Por ejemplo, se ha argumentado que los compromisos son importantes para los agentes de software interactuar, así como para el diseño del mecanismo. En el entorno anterior, la incapacidad de volver a programar un agente de software en la mosca puede verse como un compromiso con su especificación y, por lo tanto, explotada para fortalecer su posición estratégica en un entorno multiagente. Un mecanismo, por otro lado, podría verse como un conjunto de compromisos que dirigen el comportamiento de los jugadores de cierta manera deseada (ver, por ejemplo, [2]). Nuestro análisis es conceptualmente similar al de Stackelberg o los Juegos de Liderazgo [15], que se han estudiado ampliamente en la literatura económica (cf., [16]). Estos juegos analizan situaciones en las que un líder se compromete a una estrategia pura o mixta, y varios seguidores, que luego actúan simultáneamente. Nuestro enfoque, sin embargo, difiere en que se supone que todos los jugadores se mueven en un orden particular primero, segundo, tercero y, y que está destinado específicamente a incorporar una amplia gama de compromisos posibles, en particular compromisos condicionales. Después de discutir brevemente el trabajo relacionado en la Sección 2, presentamos el marco teórico formal del juego, en el que definimos las nociones de un tipo de compromiso, así como compromisos condicionales e incondicionales (Sección 3). En la Sección 4 proponemos el concepto genérico de una extorsión, que para cada tipo de compromiso captura la idea de un perfil de compromiso óptimo. Señalamos una equivalencia entre las extortiones y las soluciones de inducción hacia atrás, e investigamos si es ventajoso comprometerse más temprano en lugar de más tarde y cómo los resultados obtenidos a través de las extortiones se relacionan con la eficiencia de Pareto. La Sección 5 revisa brevemente otros tipos de compromiso, como compromisos condicionales inductivos, mixtos y mixtos. El documento concluye con una visión general de los resultados y una perspectiva para futuras investigaciones en la Sección 6. 2. El compromiso laboral relacionado es un concepto central en la teoría del juego. La posibilidad de hacer compromisos distingue la teoría de juegos no cooperativas de la cooperativa [4, 6]. Los juegos de liderazgo, como se menciona en la introducción, analizan los compromisos con estrategias puras o mixtas en lo que es esencialmente un entorno de dos jugadores [15, 16]. Informalmente, Schelling [9] ha enfatizado la importancia de las promesas, las amenazas y similares para una comprensión adecuada de la interacción social. En un nivel más formal, las amenazas también han figurado en la teoría de la negociación. El juego de amenazas de Nashs [5] y las amenazas racionales de Harsanyis [3] son dos primeros ejemplos importantes. Además, los compromisos han jugado un papel importante en la teoría de la selección de equilibrio (ver, por ejemplo, [13]. En los últimos años, la teoría del juego se ha vuelto casi indispensable como herramienta de investigación para la informática y (múltiples) investigaciones de agentes. Los compromisos no han pasado desapercibidos (ver, ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (1, 3) (3, 2) (0, 0) (2, 1) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ Figura 1: Comprometerse con una estrategia dominadapuede ser ventajoso. Por ejemplo, [1, 11]). Recientemente, también los aspectos estratégicos de los compromisos han atraído la atención de los informáticos. Por lo tanto, Conitzer y Sandholm [2] han estudiado la complejidad computacional de calcular la estrategia óptima para comprometerse en forma normal y juegos bayesianos. Sandholm y Lesser [8] emplean compromisos nivelados para el diseño de sistemas múltiples en los que los acuerdos contractuales no son completamente vinculantes. Samet [7] y Tennenholtz [12] han señalado otra conexión entre los compromisos y la informática. Su punto de partida es la observación de que los programas pueden usarse para formular compromisos que están condicionados a los programas de otros sistemas. Nuestro enfoque es similar a la configuración de Stackleberg, ya que asumimos un orden en el que los jugadores se comprometen. Sin embargo, consideramos una serie de diferentes tipos de compromiso, entre los cuales los compromisos condicionales, y proponemos un concepto de solución genérica.3. Compromisos Al comprometerse, un agente puede mejorar su posición estratégica. Incluso puede ser ventajoso comprometerse con una estrategia que está fuertemente dominada, es decir, una para la cual existe otra estrategia que produce una mejor recompensa, sin importar cómo actúen los otros agentes. Considere, por ejemplo, el juego 2 × 2 en la Figura 1, en el que un jugador, fila, elige filas y otro, col, elige columnas. Las entradas en la matriz indican los pagos para remar y col, respectivamente. Luego, la parte superior izquierda es la solución obtenida por la eliminación iterativa de estrategias fuertemente dominadas: para la fila, jugar a la parte superior siempre es mejor que jugar en la parte inferior y, por lo tanto, esa fila nunca jugará el fondo, la izquierda siempre es mejor que la correcta para el Col. Sin embargo, si Row logra convencer a COL de su compromiso de jugar Bottom, este último debería elegir la columna correcta. Por lo tanto, Row alcanza una recompensa de dos en lugar de uno. Sin embargo, a lo largo de una línea de razonamiento similar, COL desearía comprometerse con la columna izquierda, ya que la fila convincente de este compromiso le garantiza el resultado más deseable. Si, por otro lado, ambos jugadores realmente se comprometen de esta manera, pero sin convencer a la otra parte de que lo han hecho, el juego termina en miseria para ambos. Sin embargo, tipos importantes de compromisos no pueden simplemente analizarse como compromisos incondicionales con las acciones. La esencia de una amenaza, por ejemplo, es la disuasión. Si tiene éxito, no se lleva a cabo.(Esta es también la razón por la cual la credibilidad de una amenaza no se ve necesariamente si se pone en vigencia significa que el amenazador también está perjudicado). Por el contrario, las promesas se hacen para atraer y, como tal, destinadas a cumplirse. Por lo tanto, tanto las amenazas como las promesas serían estratégicamente nulas si fueran incondicionales. La Figura 2 muestra un ejemplo, en el que COL puede garantizar una recompensa de tres amenazando con elegir la columna correcta si Row elige a Top.(Esto será suficiente para disuadir la fila, y no hay necesidad de una promesa adicional por parte del Col.) No puede hacerlo simplemente cometiéndose incondicionalmente, y ninguno puede remar si se comprometiera primero. Sin embargo, en el caso de los compromisos condicionales, puede surgir un tipo particular de inconsistencia. En general, no es en general que dos compromisos puedan ser creíbles. En un juego de 2 × 2, podría ocurrir que la fila se compromete condicionalmente al jugar arriba si el sexto intl.

Col juega a la izquierda e inferior, de lo contrario. Si ahora, Col simultáneamente pudiera comprometerse con la estrategia condicional para jugar a la derecha si la fila juega arriba, y de lo contrario, de lo contrario, no hay un perfil de estrategia que se pueda jugar sin que uno de los jugadores sea llamado. Para evitar este problema, uno puede escribir compromisos condicionales en forma de reglas y definir las construcciones de puntos fijos apropiados, como lo sugiere Samet [7] y Tennenholtz [12]. Dado que verificar la equivalencia semántica de dos compromisos (o condiciones de compromiso) es indecidible en general, Tennenholtz basa su definición de equilibrio del programa sobre la equivalencia sintáctica. Nosotros, por el contrario, tratamos de evitar las construcciones de puntos fijos al suponer que los jugadores se comprometen en un orden particular. Cada jugador puede hacer que sus compromisos dependan de las acciones de los jugadores para comprometerse después de él, pero no de los compromisos de los jugadores que se cometieron antes. Sobre el tema de cómo se produce este pedido, no entramos aquí. Más bien, asumimos que está determinado por las circunstancias, lo que puede forzar o permitir que algunos jugadores se comprometan antes y a otros más tarde. Encontraremos que no siempre es beneficioso comprometerse antes que más tarde o viceversa. Otro punto para prestar atención es que solo consideramos el caso en el que los compromisos se consideran absolutamente vinculantes. No tenemos en cuenta los compromisos que pueden ser violados. Intuitivamente, esto podría entenderse como que la posibilidad de violación socava fatalmente la credibilidad del compromiso. También asumimos que los compromisos son completos, en el sentido de que colocan completamente el comportamiento de los jugadores en todas las circunstancias previsibles. Estos supuestos implican que el resultado del juego está completamente determinado por los compromisos que hacen los jugadores. Aunque estos podrían ser suposiciones inverosímil para algunas situaciones, primero estudiamos el caso idealizado primero, antes de abordar las complicaciones del caso más general. Para que estos conceptos sean formalmente precisos, primero tenemos que arreglar alguna notación.3.1 Juegos estratégicos Un juego estratégico es una tupla (n, (ai) i∈N, (ui) i∈N), donde n = {1 ,..., n} es un conjunto finito de jugadores, la IA es un conjunto de acciones disponibles para el jugador I y UI una función de utilidad de valor real para el jugador I en el conjunto de perfiles de estrategia (puros) s = a1 × · · · × an. Llamamos a un juego finito si para todos los jugadores, el conjunto de acción, AI es finito. Una estrategia mixta σi para un jugador I es una distribución de probabilidad sobre AI. Escribimos σi para el conjunto de estrategias mixtas disponibles para el jugador I, y σ = σ1 × · · · × σn para el conjunto de perfiles de estrategia mixta. Además, tenemos σ (a) y σi (a) denotan la probabilidad de acción A en el perfil de estrategia mixta σ o estrategia mixta σi, respectivamente. En la configuración que involucra la utilidad esperada, generalmente asumiremos que las funciones de utilidad representan las preferencias de von Neumann-Morgenstern. Para un jugador I y perfiles de estrategia (mixtos) σ y τ escribimos σ I τ si ui (σ) ui (τ).3.2 Compromisos condicionales en relación con un juego estratégico (n, (ai) i∈N, (ui) i∈N) y un orden π = (π1, ..., πn) de los jugadores, definimos el conjunto fπi de (puro) compromisos condicionales de un jugador πi como el conjunto de funciones de Aπ1 × · · · × Aπi - 1 a Aπi. Para π1 tenemos el conjunto de compromisos condicionales que coinciden con Aπ1. Mediante un perfil de compromiso condicional f, entendemos cualquier combinación de compromisos condicionales en Fπ1 × · · · × Fπn. Intuitivamente, π refleja el orden secuencial en el que los jugadores pueden hacer sus compromisos, con πn comprometiendo primero, πn - 1 segundo, y así sucesivamente. Cada jugador puede condicionar su acción sobre las acciones de todos los jugadores que se comprometerán después de él. De esta manera, se puede ver que cada perfil de compromiso condicional F determine un perfil de estrategia único, denotado por F, que se jugará si todos los jugadores se apegan a sus compromisos condicionales. Más formalmente, el perfil de estrategia f = (fπ1, ..., fπn) para un perfil de compromiso condicional F se define inductivamente como fπ1 = df.fπ1, fπi+1 = df.fπi+1 (fπ1, ..., fπi). La secuencia fπ1, (fπ1, fπ2) ,..., (fπ1, ..., fπn) se llamará la ruta de f. Por ejemplo, en el juego de dos jugadores de la Figura 2 y dado el orden (fila, col), la fila tiene dos compromisos condicionales, arriba e abajo, que en adelante denotaremos T y B.Col, por otro lado, tiene cuatro compromisos condicionales, correspondientes a las diferentes funciones de mapeo de estrategias de fila a las de Col. Si consideramos un compromiso condicional F para Col de tal manera que f (t) = L y F (b) = r, entonces (t, f) es un perfil de compromiso condicional y (t, f) = (t, f (t)) = (t, l). Hay una forma natural en la que un juego estratégico G junto con un pedido (π1, ..., πn) de los jugadores puede interpretarse como un juego de forma extensa con información perfecta (ver, por ejemplo, [4, 6]) 1, en el que π1 elige su acción primero, π2 segundo, y así sucesivamente. Observe que bajo esta suposición, las estrategias en el juego extenso de forma y los compromisos condicionales en el juego estratégico G con el pedido π son matemáticamente los mismos objetos. Aplicar la inducción hacia atrás a la extensa forma de juego que produce el subjuego perfecto equilibrio, que posiblemente proporcione soluciones apropiadas en este entorno. Sin embargo, desde la perspectiva de los compromisos condicionales, los jugadores se mueven en orden inverso. Argumentaremos que, bajo esta interpretación, otros perfiles de estrategia deben ser señalados según corresponda. Para ilustrar este punto, considere una vez más el juego en la Figura 2 y observe que ninguno de los jugadores puede mejorar el resultado obtenido a través de un dominio fuerte iterado al comprometerse incondicionalmente a alguna estrategia. Situaciones como esta, en las que los jugadores pueden hacer compromisos incondicionales en un orden fijo, se pueden analizar fructíferamente como juegos de forma extensos, y el compromiso incondicional más lucrativo se puede encontrar a través de la inducción hacia atrás. La Figura 3 muestra la forma extensa asociada con el juego de la Figura 2. Las estrategias disponibles para el jugador de fila son las mismas que en la forma estratégica: elegir la fila superior o inferior. Las estrategias para el jugador de columna en el extenso juego están dadas por las cuatro funciones que mapean las estrategias del jugador de filas en el juego estratégico a uno de los suyos. Transformando esta extensa forma en un juego estratégico (ver Figura 4), encontramos que existe un segundo equilibrio además del que se encuentra mediante la inducción hacia atrás. Se ha argumentado que este equilibrio con el resultado (1, 3), indicado por las líneas gruesas en la Figura 3, es inaceptable en el juego secuencial, ya que implicaría una amenaun hecho consum. Será mejor que lo haga lo mejor de un mal trato y opte por la columna izquierda después de todo. Esta es, en esencia, la línea de pensamiento que Selten siguió en su famoso argumento para el equilibrio perfecto del subjuego [10]. Sin embargo, si las estrategias de COL en la forma extensa se consideran sus compromisos condicionales que puede hacer en el caso 1 para una definición formal de un juego en forma extensa, el lector consulta uno de los libros de texto estándar, como [4]o [6]. En este documento, todas las definiciones formales se basan solo en juegos estratégicos y pedidos de los jugadores.110 El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 2 2 3 1 0 0 1 3 Row Col Figura 3: Forma extensa obtenida del juego estratégico de la Figura 2 cuando el jugador de fila elige primero una acción. La solución de inducción hacia atrás se indica mediante líneas discontinuas, la solución de compromiso condicional por las sólidas.(Las líneas punteadas horizontales no indican conjuntos de información, sino que simplemente indican qué jugadores deben moverse cuando) se mueve primero, la situación es radicalmente diferente. Por lo tanto, también asumimos que es posible que Col sea creíble la amenaza de elegir la columna correcta si la fila se reproducía en la parte superior, para asegurarse de que este último siempre esté mejor para jugar la fila inferior. Si Col puede hacer un compromiso condicional de jugar la columna derecha si la fila elige la parte superior, y la columna izquierda de lo contrario, esto deja la fila con la fácil elección entre una recompensa de cero o uno, y Col puede esperar una recompensa de tres. Esta línea de razonamiento se puede generalizar para producir un algoritmo para encontrar compromisos condicionales óptimos para los juegos generales de TwoPlayer: 1. Encuentre un perfil de estrategia S = (Sπ1, Sπ2) con el pago máximo al jugador π2, y establece Fπ1 = Sπ1 y Fπ2 (Sπ1) = Sπ2.2. Para cada tπ1 ∈ Aπ1 con tπ1 sπ1, encuentre una estrategia tπ2 ∈ Aπ2 que minimiza Uπ1 (tπ1, tπ2) y establece fπ2 (tπ1) = tπ2.3. Si uπ1 (tπ1, fπ2 (tπ1)) uπ1 (sπ1, sπ2) para todos tπ1 sπ1, return f.4. De lo contrario, encuentre el perfil de estrategia (Sπ1, Sπ2) con la recompensa más alta a π2 entre los que aún no se han considerado. Establezca fπ1 = sπ1 y fπ2 (sπ1) = sπ2, y continúe con el paso 2. Al generalizar la idea subyacente a este algoritmo, presentamos en la Sección 4 el concepto de extorsión, que se aplica a los juegos con cualquier número de jugadores. Para cualquier orden de los jugadores que contiene una extorsión, para cada jugador, un compromiso óptimo dados los compromisos de los jugadores que se comprometieron anteriormente.3.3 Tipos de compromiso Hasta ahora, hemos distinguido entre compromisos condicionales e incondicionales. Si se realiza secuencialmente, ambos determinan un perfil de estrategia único en un juego estratégico determinado. Esta noción de compromiso secuencial permite la generalización y da lugar a la siguiente definición de un tipo de compromiso (secuencial). Definición 3.1.(Tipo de compromiso secuencial) A (secuencial) El tipo de compromiso τ se asocia con cada juego estratégico G y cada pedido π de sus jugadores, una tupla xπ1 ,..., Xπn, φ, donde xπ1 ,..., Xπn son conjuntos (abstractos) de compromisos y φ es una función que mapea cada perfil en x = xπ1 × · · · × xπn a un perfil de estrategia (mixto) de G. Un tipo de compromiso Xπ1 ,..., Xπn, φ es finito cada vez que xπi es finito para cada i con 1 i n.Por lo tanto, el tipo de compromisos incondicionales se asocia con un juego y un pedido π de sus jugadores la tupla S π1 ,..., S πn, id, ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (2, 2) (2, 2) (0, 0) (0, 0) (1, 3) (3, 1) (1, 3) (3,1) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ Figura 4: El juego estratégico correspondiente a la forma extensa de la Figura 3 donde ID es la función de identidad. Del mismo modo, fπ1 ,..., Fπn, es la tupla asociada con el mismo juego por el tipo de compromisos condicionales (puros).4. Extortiones En la introducción, argumentamos informalmente cómo los jugadores podrían mejorar su posición al cometer condicionalmente. Qué tan bien pueden hacer, podría analizarse mediante un juego extenso con las acciones de cada jugador que se definen como los posibles compromisos que puede hacer. Aquí, presentamos para cada compromiso tipo A noción de extorsión correspondiente, que se define en relación con un juego estratégico y un orden de los jugadores. Las extortiones están destinadas a capturar el concepto de un perfil que contiene, para cada jugador, un compromiso óptimo dados los compromisos de los jugadores que se cometieron anteriormente. Un factor complicado es que al encontrar un compromiso óptimo de los jugadores, uno no solo debe tener en cuenta cómo tal compromiso afecta las acciones de otros jugadores, sino también cómo les permite hacer sus compromisos. Definición 4.1.(Extortiones) Sea G un juego estratégico, un orden de sus jugadores y un tipo de compromiso. Deje que τ (g, π) sea dado por xπ1 ,..., Xπn, φ. Una extensión τ del orden 0 es cualquier perfil de compromiso x ∈ Xπ1 × · · · × xπn. Para m> 0, un perfil de compromiso x ∈ Xπ1 × · · · × xπn es una τ-extorsión del orden m en g dada π si x es una τ-extorsión del orden m-1 con φ yπ1 ,..., yπm, xπm+1 ,..., xπn πm φ xπ1 ,..., xπm, xπm+1 ,..., xπn para todos los perfiles de compromiso G en x con (yπ1, ..., yπm, xπm+1, ..., xπn) A τ-extorsión del orden m-1. Una τ-extorsión es un perfil de compromiso que es una extinción τ de orden m para todos m con 0 m n.Además, decimos que un perfil de estrategia (mixto) σ es τ-intensable si hay alguna τ-extorsionada x con φ (x) = s.Por lo tanto, una extorsión del orden 1 es un perfil de compromiso en el que el jugador π1 hace un compromiso que maximiza su recompensa, dados los compromisos fijos de los otros jugadores. Una extorsión del orden M es una extorsión del orden M - 1 que maximiza el pago del jugador MS, dados los compromisos fijos de los jugadores πm+1 a πn. Para el tipo de compromisos condicionales, tenemos que cualquier perfil de compromiso condicional F es una extorsión del orden 0 y una extorsión de un orden M mayor de 0 es cualquier extorsión del orden M - 1 para el cual: Gπ1 ,..., gπm, fπm+1 ,..., fπn πm fπ1 ,..., fπm, fπm+1 ,..., fπn, para cada perfil de compromiso condicional G tal que gπ1 ,..., gπm, fπm+1 ,..., fπn una extorsión del orden M - 1. Para ilustrar el concepto de una extorsión para los compromisos condicionales, considere el juego de tres jugadores en la Figura 5 y asumir ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣gra eléctrica eléctrica y asume ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ uct eléctrica eléctrica eléctricos eléctricos y asume., 0, 2) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (4, 1, 1) (4, 0, 0) (3, 3, 2) (0, 0, 2) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ Figura 5: un juego estratégico de tres jugadores el sexto intl.

La Figura 6 muestra los posibles compromisos condicionales de los jugadores en formas extensas, con la rama izquierda correspondiente a la estrategia de filas de jugar la fila superior. Sea F y G las estrategias de compromiso condicional indicadas por las líneas gruesas en las figuras izquierda y derecha, respectivamente. Tanto F como G son extorsiones del orden 1. Sin embargo, en F y G Row, el pago más alto, los compromisos condicionales de MAT y Col. Solo G, sin embargo, también es una extorsión del Orden 2. Para apreciar que F no lo es, considere el perfil de compromiso condicional H en el que Row elige TOP y COL elige bien, no importa cómo la fila decida, es decir, H es tal que hrow = t y hcol (t) = hcol (b) = r.Entonces, (HROW, HCOL, FMAT) también es una extorsión del Orden 1, pero produce una recompensa más alta que F. Dejamos que el lector verifique que, por el contrario, G es una extorsión del Orden 3, y con ello una extorsión per se.4.1 Promesas y amenazas Una forma de comprender las extortiones condicionales es concebirlas como combinaciones de precisión de una promesa y una serie de amenazas. De los perfiles de estrategia que aún se pueden realizar dados los compromisos condicionales de los jugadores que se han cometido antes que él, un jugador trata de hacer cumplir el perfil de estrategia que le produce la mayor cantidad de recompensa posible. Por lo tanto, elige su compromiso para hacer que las desviaciones del camino que lleva a este perfil de estrategia lo sea lo más atractivo posible (amenazas) y el perfil de estrategia deseado lo más atractivo posible (promesas) para los jugadores relevantes. Si (Sπ1, ..., Sπn) es un perfil de estrategia tan deseable para el jugador πi y fπi su compromiso condicional, el valor de fπi (sπ1, ..., sπi - 1) podría tomarse como su promesa, mientras que los valoresde fπi para todos los demás (tπ1, ..., tπi - 1) podría verse como constituyendo sus amenazas. Cuanto mayor sea la recompensa para los otros jugadores en un perfil de estrategia que apunta un jugador, más fácil es para él formular una amenaza efectiva. Sin embargo, hacer amenazas apropiadas a este respecto no se reduce simplemente a minimizar los pagos a los jugadores para comprometerse más tarde siempre que sea posible. Un jugador también debe tener en cuenta los compromisos, promesas y amenazas que los siguientes jugadores pueden hacer sobre la base de sus compromisos y sus predecesores. Esto es lo que hace que el razonamiento exorbitado a veces sea tan complicado, especialmente en situaciones con más de dos jugadores. Por ejemplo, en el juego de la Figura 5, no existe una extorsión condicional que asegure a MAT un pago de dos. Para apreciar esto, considere los posibles compromisos que Mat puede hacer en Case Row juega Top y Col juega a la izquierda (TL) y en caso de que Row juegue Top y Col juega a la derecha (TR). Si MAT se compromete a la matriz correcta en ambos casos, prácticamente promete una recaudación de cuatro, dejándose con una recompensa de la máximo de uno. De lo contrario, pone a Col en una posición para disuadir la fila de elegir el fondo amenazando con elegir la columna correcta si este último lo hace. Nuevamente, MAT no puede esperar un pago superior a uno. En resumen, no importa cómo se comprometa condicionalmente MAT, permitirá a Col amenazar a la fila para que juegue a la parte superior o no pueda atraer a la fila para que juegue la fila inferior.4.2 Inducción hacia atrás benigna Las extortiones de soluciones que proporcionan también se pueden obtener modelando la situación como un juego de forma extenso y aplicando un tipo de argumento inductivo hacia atrás. Las acciones de los jugadores en cualquier juego de forma tan extenso son dadas por sus compromisos condicionales, que luego eligen secuencialmente. Para los tipos más altos de compromiso, como los compromisos condicionales, tales metagamames, sin embargo, crecen exponencialmente en el número de estrategias disponibles para los jugadores y generalmente son mucho más grandes que el juego original. La correspondencia entre las soluciones de inducción hacia atrás en el meta-juego y las extortiones del juego estratégico original significa que el concepto de extorsión se define correctamente. Primero definimos el concepto de inducción benigna hacia atrás en general en relación con un juego en forma estratégica junto con un orden de los jugadores. Intuitivamente refleja la idea que cada jugador elige para cada posible combinación de acciones de sus predecesores la acción que produce la mayor recompensa, dado que sus sucesores lo hacen de manera similar. El concepto se llama inducción benigna hacia atrás, porque implica que un jugador, cuando es indiferente entre una serie de acciones, elige la que más beneficia a sus predecesores. Para un orden π de los jugadores, hemos πr denota su reversión (πn, ..., π1). Definición 4.2.(Inducción benigna hacia atrás) Sea G un juego estratégico y un orden de sus jugadores. Una inducción benigna hacia atrás del orden 0 es cualquier perfil de compromiso condicional f sujeto a π. Para m> 0, un perfil de estrategia de compromiso condicional F es una inducción benigna hacia atrás (solución) del orden m si F es una inducción benigna hacia atrás del orden M - 1 y (gπr n, .., gπr m+1, gπr m, ..., gπr 1) πr m (gπr n, ..., gπr m+1, fπr m, ..., fπr 1) para cualquier inducción hacia atrás (gπr n, ..., gπr m+1,gπr m, ..., gπr 1) de orden m - 1. Un perfil de compromiso condicional F es una inducción benigna hacia atrás si se trata de una inducción benigna hacia atrás del orden k para cada k con 0 k n.Para los juegos con una acción finita establecida para cada jugador, el siguiente resultado sigue directamente del teorema de Kuhns (cf. [6, p. 99]). En particular, este resultado se mantiene si las acciones de los jugadores son compromisos de un tipo finito. Hecho 4.3. Para cada juego finito y cada pedido de los jugadores, existen inducciones benignas hacia atrás. Para cada juego, cada orden de sus jugadores y cada tipo de compromiso, podemos definir otro juego G ∗ con las acciones de cada jugador que dio por sus τ compromisos xi en G. la utilidad 112 la sexta intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) de un perfil de estrategia (xπ1, ..., xπn) para un jugador i en g ∗ puede equipararse en su utilidad del perfil de estrategia φ (xπn, ..., xπ1) En G. ahora encontramos que las extortiones de G se pueden recuperar como los caminos de las soluciones benignas de inducción hacia atrás del juego G ∗ para el orden πr de los jugadores, siempre que el tipo de compromiso sea finito. Teorema 4.4. Deje que G = (n, (ai) i∈N, (ui) i∈N) sea un juego y π un orden de sus jugadores con el que el tipo de compromiso finito τ asocia la tupla xπ1 ,..., Xπn, φ. Deje más g ∗ = n, (xπi) i∈N, (u ∗ πi) i∈N, donde u ∗ πi (xπn, ..., xπ1) = uπi (φ (xπ1, ..., Xπn))), para cada perfil de compromiso τ (xπ1, ..., xπn). Entonces, un perfil de comisión π (xπ1, ..., xπn) es una τ-extortion en g dada π si y solo si hay alguna inducción benigna hacia atrás f en g ∗ dada πr con f = (xπn, ..., xπ1). Prueba. Suponga que F es una inducción benigna hacia atrás en G ∗ en relación con πr. Entonces, f = (xπn, ..., xπ1), para algún perfil de compromiso (xπ1, ..., xπn) de g relativo a π. Mostramos por inducción que (xπ1, ..., xπn) es una extorsión del orden m, para todos m con 0 m n.Para M = 0, la prueba es trivial. Para el paso de inducción, considere un perfil de compromiso arbitrario (yπ1, ..., yπn) tal que (yπ1, ..., yπm, xπm+1, .., xπn) es una extorsión del orden m - 1. En virtud de la hipótesis de inducción, hay una inducción benigna hacia atrás G de orden M - 1 en G ∗ con g = (xπn, ..., xπm+1, yπm, ..., yπ1). Como F es también una inducción benigna hacia atrás del orden M: (Gπn, ..., Gπ1) ∗ πm (Gπn, ..., Gπm+1, Fπm, ..., Fπ1). Por lo tanto, (xπn, ..., xπm+1, yπm, ..., yπ1) ∗ πm (xπn, ..., xπ1). Por definición de u ∗ πm, entonces también: φ (yπ1, ..., yπm, xπm+1, ..., xπn) πm φ (xπ1, ..., xπn). Podemos concluir que X es una extorsión del orden m.Para la única dirección if, suponga que X es una extorsión de G dada π. Probamos que hay una inducción benigna hacia atrás F (∗) en g ∗ para πr con f (∗) = x. En virtud del hecho 4.3, hay una inducción benigna hacia atrás h en g ∗ dada πr. Ahora defina f (∗) de tal manera que f (∗) πi (zπn, ..., zπi - 1) = xπi, if (zπn, ..., zπi - 1) = (xπn, ..,,,,,,,,,,.xπi - 1), y f (∗) πi (zπn, ..., zπi - 1) = hπi (zπn, ..., zπi - 1), de lo contrario. Probamos por inducción en M, que F (∗) es una inducción benigna hacia atrás del orden M, para cada m con 0 m n.La base es trivial. Entonces, suponga que F (∗) es una inducción hacia atrás del orden M - 1 en G ∗ Dada πr y considere una inducción benigna hacia atrás arbitraria G del orden M - 1 en G ∗ Dada πr. Deje que G se administre por (yπn, ..., yπ1). O (yπn, ..., yπm+1) = (xπn, ..., xπm+1), o este no es el caso. Si es este último, se puede apreciar fácilmente que: (gπn, ..., gπm+1, f (∗) πm, ..., f (∗) π1) = (gπn, ..., gπm+1,Hπm, ..., Hπ1). Habiendo asumido que H es una inducción benigna hacia atrás, posteriormente, (gπn, ..., gπ1) ∗ m (gπn, ..., gπm+1, hπm, ..., hπ1), y (gπn, .. .. .. ..., gπ1) ∗ m (gπn, ..., gπm+1, f (∗) πm, ..., f (∗) π1). Por lo tanto, F (∗) es una inducción benigna hacia atrás del orden m.En el primer caso, el razonamiento es ligeramente diferente. Entonces, (gπn, ..., gπ1) = (xπn, ..., xπm+1, yπm, ..., yπ1). Se deduce que: (gπn, ..., gπm+1, f (∗) πm, ..., f (∗) π1) = (f (∗) πn, ..., f (∗) π1) = =(xπn, ..., xπ1). En virtud de la hipótesis de inducción, (yπ1, ..., yπn) es una extorsión del orden m - 1 en g dado π. Como el razonamiento tiene lugar bajo la suposición de que X es una extorsión en G dada π, también tenemos: φ (yπ1, ..., yπm, xπm+1, ..., xπn) πm φ (xπ1, ..., xπn). Entonces, (xπn, ..., xπm+1, yπm, ..., yπ1,) ∗ πm (xπn, ..., xπ1).,, Por definición de u ∗. Podemos concluir que: (gπn, ..., gπ1) ∗ πm (gπn, ..., gπm+1, f (∗) πm, ..., f (∗) π1), lo que significa que f (∗)es una inducción benigna hacia atrás del orden m.Como consecuencia inmediata del teorema 4.4 y el hecho 4.3 también tenemos el siguiente resultado. Corolario 4.5. Sea τ un tipo de compromiso finito. Luego, existen τ-extortiones para cada juego estratégico y para cada pedido de los jugadores.4.3 Orden de compromiso En caso de compromisos incondicionales, no siempre es favorable ser el primero en comprometerse. Esto está bien ilustrado por los conocidos juego de papel de rock-papel. Si, por otro lado, los jugadores están en condiciones de hacer compromisos condicionales en este juego en particular, moverse primero es una ventaja. Más bien, encontramos que nunca puede dañar moverse primero en un juego de dos jugadores con compromisos condicionales. Teorema 4.6. Deje que G sea un juego estratégico de dos jugadores que involucre al jugador i. Además, sea una extorsión de G en la que me compromete primero, y G una extorsión en la que me compromete en segundo lugar. Entonces, g i f. Boceto de prueba. Sea F una extorsión condicional en g dada π. Es suficiente demostrar que hay alguna extorsión condicional H del orden 1 en g dado π con h = f. Suponga por una contradicción que no existe tal extorsión del orden 1 en g dado π. Entonces debe haber algunos b ∗ ∈ Aj tal que f ≺j b ∗, a, para todos a ∈ Ai.(De lo contrario, podríamos definir (GJ, GI) tal que GJ = FJ (Fi), GI (GJ) = Fi, y para cualquier otro B ∈ Aj, GI (B) = A ∗, donde A ∗ es una acción en AItal que (b, a ∗) j f. Entonces G sería una extorsión del orden 1 en G administrado π con g.) Ahora considere un perfil de compromiso condicional H para G y π de tal manera que hj (a) = b ∗, para todos a ∈ Ai. Deje que más hola sea tal que (a, hj) i (hola, hj), para todos a ∈ Ai. Entonces, H es una extorsión del orden 1 en g dado π. Observe que (HI, HJ) = (FI, B ∗). Por lo tanto, F ≺j H, contradiciendo la suposición de que F es una extorsión en G administrada π.Teorema 4.6 no se generaliza a los juegos con más de dos jugadores. Considere el juego de tres jugadores en la Figura 7, con formas extensas como en la Figura 8. Aquí, Row y Mat tienen preferencias idénticas. Sin embargo, los poderes exorbitantes de los últimos colon son muy débiles si se compromete primero: cualquier compromiso condicional que haga pone a Col en una situación en la que ella puede hacer cumplir una recompensa de dos, dejando a Mat y Row en el frío con una recompensa deuno. Sin embargo, si MAT es el último en cometer y remar primero, entonces este último puede explotar sus poderes estratégicos, amenazar a Col para que ella juegue a la izquierda y garantice a sí mismo y a MAT una recompensa de dos.4.4 Eficiencia de Pareto Otro problema se refiere a la eficiencia de Pareto de los perfiles de estrategia extorsionables a través de compromisos condicionales. Decimos que un perfil de estrategia s (débilmente) Pareto domina otro perfil de estrategia si es para todos los jugadores que yo y su es para algunos. Además, un perfil de estrategia es (débil) pareto eficiente si no está (débil) pareto dominado por cualquier otro perfil de estrategia. Extendemos esta terminología a los perfiles de compromiso condicional al decir que un perfil de compromiso condicional F es (débil) pareto eficiente o (débil) Pareto domina otro perfil de compromiso condicional si F es o eso es o eso. Ahora tenemos el siguiente resultado.⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (0, 1, 0) (0, 0, 0) (0, 0, 0) (1, 2, 1) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (2, 1, 2) (0, 0, 0) (0, 0, 0) (1, 2, 1) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ Figura 7: Un juego de tres personas.

Teorema 4.7. En cada juego, existen extortiones condicionales eficientes de Pareto. Además, cualquier perfil de estrategia que Pareto domine una extorsión también es extorsionable a través de un compromiso condicional. Boceto de prueba. Dado que, en virtud de hecho 4.5, las extortiones generalmente existe en cada juego, es suficiente reconocer que el segundo reclamo se celebra. Sea s el perfil de estrategia (Sπ1, ..., Sπn). Deje que la extorsión condicional f esté dominada por s.Una extorsión G con g = s se puede construir adoptando todas las amenazas de F mientras prometen g. Es decir, para todos los jugadores πi tenemos gπi (sπ1, ..., sπi - 1) = si y gπi (tπ1, ..., tπn) = fπi (tπ1, ..., tπn), para todos los demás tπ1,..., tπn. A medida que S Pareto domina F, las amenazas de F siguen siendo efectivas como amenazas de G dado que se promete S. Este resultado sugiere una diferencia entre la inducción (benigna) hacia atrás y las extortiones. En general, las soluciones de inducciones benignas hacia atrás pueden estar dominadas por los resultados que no son soluciones benignas de inducción hacia atrás. Por lo tanto, aunque cada extorsión puede verse como una inducción benigna hacia atrás en un juego más grande, no es el caso de que todas las propiedades formales de las extortiones sean compartidas por inducciones benignas hacia atrás en general.5. Otros tipos de compromiso Los compromisos condicionales e incondicionales son solo dos tipos de compromiso posibles. La definición también proporciona tipos de compromiso que permitan comprometerse con los compromisos, lo que logran un ajuste más fino de promesas y amenazas. Del mismo modo, subsume compromisos en y con estrategias mixtas. En esta sección comentamos algunas de estas posibilidades.5.1 Compromisos inductivos Además de hacer compromisos condicionados a las acciones de los jugadores para comprometerse más tarde, uno también podría comprometerse en los compromisos de los siguientes jugadores. Informalmente, tales compromisos tendrían la forma de si solo se atreve a comprometerse de tal y así, entonces hago tal y tal, de lo contrario prometo actuar así y así. Para un juego estratégico G y un orden de orden de los jugadores, definimos los compromisos inductivos de los jugadores de manera inductiva. Los compromisos inductivos disponibles para π1 coinciden con las acciones que están disponibles para él. Un compromiso inductivo para el jugador πi+1 es una función que mapea cada perfil de compromisos inductivos de los jugadores π1 a πi a una de sus acciones básicas. Formalmente definimos el tipo de compromisos inductivos Fπ1 ,..., Fπn, de modo que para cada jugador πi en un juego g y dado π: fπ1 = df. Aπ1, fπi+1 = df. A Fπ1 × ··· × Fπi πi+1. Sea fπi = fπi fπ1 ,..., Fπi - 1, para cada jugador πi y ha denota el perfil de estrategia pura fπ1 ,..., fπn. Los compromisos inductivos tienen un mayor poder exorbitante que los compromisos condicionales. Para apreciar esto, considere una vez más el juego en la Figura 5. Descubrimos que el perfil de estrategia en el que Row elige Bottom y Col y Mat, ambos eligen a la izquierda, no es extorsable a través de compromisos condicionales. Por medio de compromisos inductivos, sin embargo, esto es posible. Sea f el perfil de compromiso inductivo de tal manera que Frow sea fila eligiendo la fila inferior (b), fcol es el reproductor de columna que elige la columna izquierda (l) sin importar cómo decida la fila, y fmat se define de tal manera que: fmat frow, fcol =⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ r si frow = t y fcol (b) = r, l de lo contrario. En lugar de mostrar formalmente que F es una extorsión inductiva del perfil de estrategia (B, L, L), señalamos informalmente cómo se puede hacer esto. Argumentamos que para exigir una recompensa de dos por medio de una extorsión condicional, MAT tendría que atraer la fila para elegir la fila inferior sin al mismo tiempo poner a Col en una posición para amenazar con éxito a la fila para no elegir la parte superior. Descubrimos que esto es imposible si los jugadores solo pueden hacer compromisos condicionales. Por el contrario, si MAT puede comprometerse con los compromisos, puede socavar los esfuerzos del Cols para amenazar a la fila jugando la matriz correcta, si COL lo hacía. Sin embargo, MAT todavía puede forzar a la fila a elegir la fila inferior, en caso de que los desistes de los Col se formen por hacer esta amenaza. Como se puede observar fácilmente, en cualquier juego, los compromisos inductivos de los dos primeros jugadores para cometer coincidir con sus compromisos condicionales. Por lo tanto, como consecuencia inmediata del Teorema 4.6, nunca puede dañar ser el primero en comprometerse con un compromiso inductivo en el caso de los dos jugadores. Del mismo modo, encontramos que el juego representado en la Figura 7 también sirve como ejemplo que muestra que, en caso de que haya más de dos jugadores, no siempre es mejor comprometerse con un compromiso inductivo temprano. En este ejemplo, la posición estratégica de MAT es tan débil si se compromete primero, que incluso la posibilidad de comprometerse inductivamente no la fortalece, mientras que, de manera similar, como con los compromisos condicionales, la fila puede imponer una recompensa de dos a ambosél mismo y Mat si él es el primero en comprometerse.5.2 Tipos de compromisos mixtos Hasta ahora hemos considerado compromisos con estrategias puras. Una extensión natural también sería considerar compromisos con estrategias mixtas. Distinguemos entre compromisos condicionales, incondicionales e inductivos mixtos. Encontramos que generalmente son bastante incomparables con sus contrapartes puras: en algunas situaciones, un jugador puede lograr más usando un compromiso mixto, en otro usando un tipo de compromiso puro. Un factor complicado con los tipos de compromiso mixto es que 114 el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) puede dar como resultado un perfil de estrategia mixto que se juega. Esto hace que la distinción entre promesas y amenazas, como se delineó en la Sección 4.1, se borra de los tipos de compromiso mixto. El tipo de compromisos incondicionales mixtos se asocia con cada juego G y ordenando π de sus jugadores la tupla σπ1 ,..., Σπn, id. El caso de dos jugadores se ha estudiado ampliamente (por ejemplo, [2, 16]). De hecho, el famoso teorema de Minimax de Von Neumann muestra que para los juegos de dos jugadores cero, no importa qué jugador comete primero. Si el segundo jugador en comprometerse juega una estrategia mixta que garantiza su nivel de seguridad, el primer jugador en comprometerse no puede hacer mejor que hacerlo también [14]. En el juego de la Figura 5, encontramos que, con compromisos condicionales, MAT no puede hacer cumplir un resultado que le otorga una recompensa de dos. Recuerde que la razón de esta falla es que cualquier esfuerzo para disuadir la fila de elegir la fila superior es defectuosa, ya que pondría a Col en una excelente posición para amenazar a la fila para no elegir la fila inferior. Sin embargo, si MAT tiene compromisos inductivos a su disposición, esta es una posibilidad. Ahora encontramos que en caso de que los jugadores puedan deshacerse de estrategias mixtas incondicionales, MAT está en una posición muy similar. Podría aleatorizar uniformemente entre la matriz izquierda y derecha. Entonces, la utilidad esperada de las filas es 21 2 si juega la fila superior, sin importar cómo Col aleatoriza. La recompensa esperada de COL tampoco excede 21 2, en caso de que Row elija la parte superior. Al comprometerse puramente con la columna izquierda, Col Player atrae a Row para jugar al fondo, ya que su utilidad esperada asciende a 3. Esto asegura una utilidad esperada de tres para Col también. Sin embargo, un jugador no siempre está mejor con compromisos mixtos incondicionales que con compromisos condicionales puros. Para un ejemplo, considere el juego en la Figura 2. Usando compromisos condicionales puros, puede garantizar una recompensa de tres, mientras que con los compromisos mixtos incondicionales 21 2 sería lo máximo que podría lograr. Tampoco es en general ventajoso comprometerse primero con una estrategia mixta en un juego de tres jugadores. Para apreciar esto, considere una vez más el juego en la Figura 7. Una vez más, comprometerse con una estrategia mixta no logrará mucho para MAT si se mueve primero, y como antes, los otros jugadores no tienen ninguna razón para comprometerse con otra cosa que no sea una estrategia pura. Esto es válido para todos los jugadores si Row se compromete en primer lugar, Col Second y Mat Last, ya sea que en este caso Mat obtiene la mejor recompensa que puede obtener. Compromisos análogos a los condicionales e inductivos Uno también se puede definir los tipos de compromisos inductivos condicionales mixtos y mixtos. Con el primero, un jugador puede condicionar sus estrategias mixtas sobre las estrategias mixtas de los jugadores para comprometerse después de él. Estos tienden a ser objetos muy grandes y, sabiendo poco sobre ellos, pero enviamos su análisis formal para futuras investigaciones. Conceptualmente, podría no estar claro de inmediato cómo se pueden hacer tales compromisos condicionales mixtos con credibilidad. Por un lado, cuando los compromisos son condicionales sobre una estrategia mixta particular que se juega, ¿cómo se puede reconocer que, de hecho, fue esta estrategia mixta la que se jugó en lugar de otra? Si esto resulta imposible, ¿cómo se puede saber cómo se efectuarán sus compromisos condicionales? Una posible respuesta sería que todo depende de las circunstancias en que se hicieron los compromisos. Por ejemplo, si los diferentes agentes pueden enviar sus compromisos condicionales mixtos con una parte independiente, este último puede ejecutar las aleatorizaciones y determinar el perfil de estrategia mixto único que inducen sus compromisos.6. Resumen y conclusión en algunas situaciones Los agentes pueden fortalecer su posición estratégica comprometiéndose con un curso de acción particular. Existen varios tipos de compromiso, por ejemplo, puro, mixto y condicional. Qué tipo de compromiso se encuentra un agente para hacer esencialmente depende de la situación bajo consideración. Si los agentes se comprometen en un orden particular, existe una táctica común a hacer compromisos de cualquier tipo, que hemos formalizado por medio del concepto de extorsión. Este concepto genérico de extorsión se puede analizar en abstracto. Además, sobre su base, los diversos tipos de compromiso se pueden comparar formal y sistemáticamente. Hemos visto que el tipo de compromiso que puede hacer un agente tiene un profundo impacto en lo que un agente puede lograr en una situación de gamel como un juego. En algunas situaciones, un jugador está muy ayudado si está en condiciones de comprometerse condicionalmente, mientras que en otros compromisos mixtos serían más rentables. Esto plantea la pregunta sobre las características formales características de las situaciones en las que es ventajoso que un jugador pueda hacer compromisos de un tipo particular. Otro problema que dejamos para futuras investigaciones es la complejidad computacional de encontrar una extorsión para los diferentes tipos de compromiso.7. Referencias [1] A. K. Chopra y M. Singh.

        "From the strategy profiles that can still be realized given the conditional commitments of players that have committed before him, a player tries to enforce the strategy profile that yields him as much payoff as possible.",

        "The actions of the players in any such extensive form game are then given by their conditional commitments, which they then choose sequentially.",

        "Here, Row and Mat have identical preferences.",

        "However, if Mat is last to commit and Row first, then the latter can exploit his strategic powers, threaten Col so that she plays left, and guarantee both himself and Mat a payoff of two. 4.4 Pareto Efficiency Another issue concerns the Pareto efficiency of the strategy profiles extortionable through conditional commitments.",
        "We say that a strategy profile s (weakly) Pareto dominates another strategy profile t if t i s for all players i and s it for some.",

        "Theorem 4.7.",
        "In each game, Pareto efficient conditional extortions exist.",
        "Moreover, any strategy profile that Pareto dominates an extortion is also extortionable through a conditional commitment.",
        "Proof sketch.",
        "Since, in virtue of Fact 4.5, extortions generally exists in each game, it suffices to recognize that the second claim holds.",
        "Let s be the strategy profile (sπ1 , . . . , sπn ).",
        "Let further the conditional extortion f be Pareto dominated by s. An extortion g with g = s can then be constructed by adopting all threats of f while promising g .",
        "I.e., for all players πi we have gπi (sπ1 , . . . , sπi−1 ) = si and gπi (tπ1 , . . . , tπn ) = fπi (tπ1 , . . . , tπn ), for all other tπ1 , . . . , tπn .",
        "As s Pareto dominates f , the threats of f remain effective as threats of g given that s is being promised.",
        "This result hints at a difference between (benign) backward induction and extortions.",
        "In general, solutions of benign backward inductions can be Pareto dominated by outcomes that are no benign backward induction solutions.",
        "Therefore, although every extortion can be seen as a benign backward induction in a larger game, it is not the case that all formal properties of extortions are shared by benign backward inductions in general. 5.",
        "OTHER COMMITMENT TYPES Conditional and unconditional commitments are only two possible commitment types.",
        "The definition also provides for types of commitment that allow for committing on commitments, thus achieving a finer adjustment of promises and threats.",
        "Similarly, it subsumes commitments on and to mixed strategies.",
        "In this section we comment on some of these possibilities. 5.1 Inductive Commitments Apart from making commitments conditional on the actions of the players to commit later, one could also commit on the commitments of the following players.",
        "Informally, such commitments would have the form of if you only dare to commit in such and such a way, then I do such and such, otherwise I promise to act so and so.",
        "For a strategic game G and an ordering π of the players, we define the inductive commitments of the players inductively.",
        "The inductive commitments available to π1 coincide with the actions that are available to him.",
        "An inductive commitment for player πi+1 is a function mapping each profile of inductive commitments of players π1 through πi to one of his basic actions.",
        "Formally we define the type of inductive commitments Fπ1 , . . . , Fπn , such that for each player πi in a game G and given π: Fπ1 =df.",
        "Aπ1 , Fπi+1 =df.",
        "A Fπ1 ×···×Fπi πi+1 .",
        "Let fπi = fπi fπ1 , . . . , fπi−1 , for each player πi and have f denote the pure strategy profile fπ1 , . . . , fπn .",
        "Inductive commitments have a greater extortionate power than conditional commitments.",
        "To appreciate this, consider once more the game in Figure 5.",
        "We found that the strategy profile in which Row chooses bottom and Col and Mat both choose left is not extortionable through conditional commitments.",
        "By means of inductive commitments, however, this is possible.",
        "Let f be the inductive commitment profile such that fRow is Row choosing the bottom row (b), fCol is the column player choosing the left column (l) no matter how Row decides, and fMat is defined such that: fMat fRow, fCol = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ r if fRow = t and fCol (b) = r, l otherwise.",
        "Instead of showing formally that f is an inductive extortion of the strategy profile (b, l, l), we point out informally how this can be done.",
        "We argued that in order to exact a payoff of two by means of a conditional extortion, Mat would have to lure Row into choosing the bottom row without at the same time putting Col in a position to successfully threaten Row not to choose top.",
        "This, we found, is an impossibility if the players can only make conditional commitments.",
        "By contrast, if Mat can commit to commitments, he can undermine Cols efforts to threaten Row by playing the right matrix, if Col were to do so.",
        "Yet, Mat can still force Row to choose the bottom row, in case Col desists form making this threat.",
        "As can readily be observed, in any game, the inductive commitments of the first two players to commit coincide with their conditional commitments.",
        "Hence, as an immediate consequence of Theorem 4.6, it can never harm to be the first to commit to an inductive commitment in the two player case.",
        "Similarly, we find that the game depicted in Figure 7 also serves as an example showing that, in case there are more than two players, it is not always better to commit to an inductive commitment early.",
        "In this example the strategic position of Mat is so weak if he is to commit first, that even the possibility to commit inductively does not strengthen it, whereas, in a similar fashion as with conditional commitments, Row can enforce a payoff of two to both himself and Mat if he is the first to commit. 5.2 Mixed Commitments Types So far we have merely considered commitments to and on pure strategies.",
        "A natural extension would be also to consider commitments to and on mixed strategies.",
        "We distinguish between conditional, unconditional as well as inductive mixed commitments.",
        "We find that they are generally quite incomparable with their pure counterparts: in some situations a player can achieve more using a mixed commitment, in another using a pure commitment type.",
        "A complicating factor with mixed commitment types is that they 114 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) can result in a mixed strategy profile being played.",
        "This makes that the distinction between promises and threats, as delineated in Section 4.1, gets blurred for mixed commitment types.",
        "The type of mixed unconditional commitments associates with each game G and ordering π of its players the tuple Σπ1 , . . . , Σπn , id .",
        "The two-player case has been extensively studied (e.g., [2, 16]).",
        "As a matter of fact, von Neumanns famous minimax theorem shows that for two-player zero-sum games, it does not matter which player commits first.",
        "If the second player to commit plays a mixed strategy that ensures his security level, the first player to commit can do no better than to do so as well [14].",
        "In the game of Figure 5 we found that, with conditional commitments, Mat is unable to enforce an outcome that awards him a payoff of two.",
        "Recall that the reason of this failure is that any effort to deter Row from choosing the top row is flawed, as it would put Col in an excellent position to threaten Row not to choose the bottom row.",
        "If Mat has inductive commitments at his disposal, however, this is a possibility.",
        "We now find that in case the players can dispose of unconditional mixed strategies, Mat is in a much similar position.",
        "He could randomize uniformly between the left and right matrix.",
        "Then, Rows expected utility is 21 2 if he plays the top row, no matter how Col randomizes.",
        "The expected payoff of Col does not exceed 21 2 , either, in case Row chooses top.",
        "By purely committing to the left column, Col player entices Row to play bottom, as his expected utility then amounts to 3.",
        "This ensures an expected utility of three for Col as well.",
        "However, a player is not always better off with unconditional mixed commitments than with pure conditional commitments.",
        "For an example, consider the game in Figure 2.",
        "Using pure conditional commitments, he can ensure a payoff of three, whereas with unconditional mixed commitments 21 2 would be the most he could achieve.",
        "Neither is it in general advantageous to commit first to a mixed strategy in a three-player game.",
        "To appreciate this, consider once more the game in Figure 7.",
        "Again committing to a mixed strategy will not achieve much for Mat if he is to move first, and as before the other players have no reason to commit to anything other than a pure strategy.",
        "This holds for all players if Row commits first, Col second and Mat last, be it that in this case Mat obtains the best payoff he can get.",
        "Analogous to conditional and inductive commitments one can also define the types of mixed conditional and mixed inductive commitments.",
        "With the former, a player can condition his mixed strategies on the mixed strategies of the players to commit after him.",
        "These tend to be very large objects and, knowing little about them yet, we shelve their formal analysis for future research.",
        "Conceptually, it might not be immediately clear how such mixed conditional commitments can be made with credibility.",
        "For one, when ones commitments are conditional on a particular mixed strategy being played, how can it be recognized that it was in fact this mixed strategy that was played rather than another one?",
        "If this proves to be impossible, how can one know how his conditional commitments is to be effectuated?",
        "A possible answer would be, that all depends on the circumstances in which the commitments were made.",
        "E.g., if the different agents can submit their mixed conditional commitments to an independent party, the latter can execute the randomizations and determine the unique mixed strategy profile that their commitments induce. 6.",
        "SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION In some situations agents can strengthen their strategic position by committing themselves to a particular course of action.",
        "There are various types of commitment, e.g., pure, mixed and conditional.",
        "Which type of commitment an agent is in a position in to make essentially depends on the situation under consideration.",
        "If the agents commit in a particular order, there is a tactic common to making commitments of any type, which we have formalized by means the concept of an extortion.",
        "This generic concept of extortion can be analyzed in abstracto.",
        "Moreover, on its basis the various commitment types can be compared formally and systematically.",
        "We have seen that the type of commitment an agent can make has a profound impact on what an agent can achieve in a gamelike situation.",
        "In some situations a player is much helped if he is in a position to commit conditionally, whereas in others mixed commitments would be more profitable.",
        "This raises the question as to the characteristic formal features of the situations in which it is advantageous for a player to be able to make commitments of a particular type.",
        "Another issue which we leave for future research is the computational complexity of finding an extortion for the different commitment types. 7.",

                "In the game of Figure 5 we found that, with conditional commitments, Mat is unable to enforce an outcome that awards him a payoff of two.",
                "Recall that the reason of this failure is that any effort to deter Row from choosing the top row is flawed, as it would put Col in an excellent position to threaten Row not to choose the bottom row.",

                "By purely committing to the left column, Col player entices Row to play bottom, as his expected utility then amounts to 3.",
                "This ensures an expected utility of three for Col as well.",

                "This holds for all players if Row commits first, Col second and Mat last, be it that in this case Mat obtains the best payoff he can get.",
                "Analogous to conditional and inductive commitments one can also define the types of mixed conditional and mixed inductive commitments.",

                "We argued that in order to exact a payoff of two by means of a conditional extortion, Mat would have to lure Row into choosing the bottom row without at the same time putting Col in a position to successfully threaten Row not to choose top.",
                "This, we found, is an impossibility if the players can only make conditional commitments.",

                "Recall that the reason of this failure is that any effort to deter Row from choosing the top row is flawed, as it would put Col in an excellent position to threaten Row not to choose the bottom row.",

                "Using pure conditional commitments, he can ensure a payoff of three, whereas with unconditional mixed commitments 21 2 would be the most he could achieve.",

                "We argued that in order to exact a payoff of two by means of a conditional <br>extortion</br>, Mat would have to lure Row into choosing the bottom row without at the same time putting Col in a position to successfully threaten Row not to choose top.",

                "The two-player case has been extensively studied (e.g., [2, 16]).",
                "As a matter of fact, von Neumanns famous minimax theorem shows that for two-player zero-sum games, it does not matter which player commits first.",
                "If the second player to commit plays a mixed strategy that ensures his security level, the first player to commit can do no better than to do so as well [14].",
                "In the game of Figure 5 we found that, with conditional commitments, Mat is unable to enforce an outcome that awards him a payoff of two.",
                "Recall that the reason of this failure is that any effort to deter Row from choosing the top row is flawed, as it would put Col in an excellent position to threaten Row not to choose the bottom row.",
                "If Mat has inductive commitments at his disposal, however, this is a possibility.",
                "We now find that in case the players can dispose of unconditional mixed strategies, Mat is in a much similar position.",

                "By purely committing to the left column, Col player entices Row to play bottom, as his expected utility then amounts to 3.",
                "This ensures an expected utility of three for Col as well.",
                "However, a player is not always better off with unconditional mixed commitments than with pure conditional commitments.",
                "For an example, consider the game in Figure 2.",
                "Using pure conditional commitments, he can ensure a payoff of three, whereas with unconditional mixed commitments 21 2 would be the most he could achieve.",
                "Neither is it in general advantageous to commit first to a mixed strategy in a three-player game.",
                "To appreciate this, consider once more the game in Figure 7.",
                "Again committing to a mixed strategy will not achieve much for Mat if he is to move first, and as before the other players have no reason to commit to anything other than a pure strategy.",
                "This holds for all players if Row commits first, Col second and Mat last, be it that in this case Mat obtains the best payoff he can get.",
                "Analogous to conditional and inductive commitments one can also define the types of mixed conditional and mixed inductive commitments.",
                "With the former, a player can condition his mixed strategies on the mixed strategies of the players to commit after him.",
                "These tend to be very large objects and, knowing little about them yet, we shelve their formal analysis for future research.",

                "If this proves to be impossible, how can one know how his conditional commitments is to be effectuated?",
                "A possible answer would be, that all depends on the circumstances in which the commitments were made.",
                "E.g., if the different agents can submit their mixed conditional commitments to an independent party, the latter can execute the randomizations and determine the unique mixed strategy profile that their commitments induce. 6.",

                "In this example the strategic position of Mat is so weak if he is to commit first, that even the possibility to commit inductively does not strengthen it, whereas, in a similar fashion as with conditional commitments, Row can enforce a payoff of two to both himself and Mat if he is the first to commit. 5.2 Mixed Commitments Types So far we have merely considered commitments to and on pure strategies.",
                "A natural extension would be also to consider commitments to and on mixed strategies.",
                "We distinguish between conditional, unconditional as well as inductive mixed commitments.",
                "We find that they are generally quite incomparable with their pure counterparts: in some situations a player can achieve more using a mixed commitment, in another using a pure commitment type.",
                "A complicating factor with mixed commitment types is that they 114 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) can result in a mixed strategy profile being played.",
                "This makes that the distinction between promises and threats, as delineated in Section 4.1, gets blurred for mixed commitment types.",
                "The type of mixed unconditional commitments associates with each game G and ordering π of its players the tuple Σπ1 , . . . , Σπn , id .",
                "The two-player case has been extensively studied (e.g., [2, 16]).",
                "As a matter of fact, von Neumanns famous minimax theorem shows that for two-player zero-sum games, it does not matter which player commits first.",
                "If the second player to commit plays a mixed strategy that ensures his security level, the first player to commit can do no better than to do so as well [14].",
                "In the game of Figure 5 we found that, with conditional commitments, Mat is unable to enforce an outcome that awards him a payoff of two.",
                "Recall that the reason of this failure is that any effort to deter Row from choosing the top row is flawed, as it would put Col in an excellent position to threaten Row not to choose the bottom row.",
                "If Mat has inductive commitments at his disposal, however, this is a possibility.",
                "We now find that in case the players can dispose of unconditional mixed strategies, Mat is in a much similar position.",
                "He could randomize uniformly between the left and right matrix.",
                "Then, Rows expected utility is 21 2 if he plays the top row, no matter how Col randomizes.",
                "The expected payoff of Col does not exceed 21 2 , either, in case Row chooses top.",
                "By purely committing to the left column, Col player entices Row to play bottom, as his expected utility then amounts to 3.",
                "This ensures an expected utility of three for Col as well.",
                "However, a player is not always better off with unconditional mixed commitments than with pure conditional commitments.",
                "For an example, consider the game in Figure 2.",
                "Using pure conditional commitments, he can ensure a payoff of three, whereas with unconditional mixed commitments 21 2 would be the most he could achieve.",
                "Neither is it in general advantageous to commit first to a mixed strategy in a three-player game.",
                "To appreciate this, consider once more the game in Figure 7.",
                "Again committing to a mixed strategy will not achieve much for Mat if he is to move first, and as before the other players have no reason to commit to anything other than a pure strategy.",
                "This holds for all players if Row commits first, Col second and Mat last, be it that in this case Mat obtains the best payoff he can get.",
                "Analogous to conditional and inductive commitments one can also define the types of mixed conditional and mixed inductive commitments.",
                "With the former, a player can condition his mixed strategies on the mixed strategies of the players to commit after him.",
                "These tend to be very large objects and, knowing little about them yet, we shelve their formal analysis for future research.",
                "Conceptually, it might not be immediately clear how such mixed conditional commitments can be made with credibility.",
                "For one, when ones commitments are conditional on a particular mixed strategy being played, how can it be recognized that it was in fact this mixed strategy that was played rather than another one?",
                "If this proves to be impossible, how can one know how his conditional commitments is to be effectuated?",
                "A possible answer would be, that all depends on the circumstances in which the commitments were made.",
                "E.g., if the different agents can submit their mixed conditional commitments to an independent party, the latter can execute the randomizations and determine the unique mixed strategy profile that their commitments induce. 6.",
                "SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION In some situations agents can strengthen their strategic position by committing themselves to a particular course of action.",
                "There are various types of commitment, e.g., pure, mixed and conditional.",
                "Which type of commitment an agent is in a position in to make essentially depends on the situation under consideration.",
                "If the agents commit in a particular order, there is a tactic common to making commitments of any type, which we have formalized by means the concept of an extortion.",
                "This generic concept of extortion can be analyzed in abstracto.",
                "Moreover, on its basis the various commitment types can be compared formally and systematically.",
                "We have seen that the type of commitment an agent can make has a profound impact on what an agent can achieve in a gamelike situation.",
                "In some situations a player is much helped if he is in a position to commit conditionally, whereas in others mixed commitments would be more profitable.",
                "This raises the question as to the characteristic formal features of the situations in which it is advantageous for a player to be able to make commitments of a particular type.",
                "Another issue which we leave for future research is the computational complexity of finding an extortion for the different commitment types. 7.",
