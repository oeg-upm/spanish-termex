This model allows us to circumvent Myerson and Satterthwaites impossibility result and present a bilateral market mechanism that is efficient, individually rational, incentive compatible and budget balanced in the single-unit heterogeneous setting. The underlying scheme makes this combination of desirable qualities possible by reporting a price range for each buyer-seller pair that defines a zone of possible agreements, while the final price is left open for negotiation.

INTRODUCTION In this paper we introduce the concept of negotiation based mechanisms in the context of the theory of efficient truthful markets. A market consists of multiple buyers and sellers who wish to exchange goods. The markets main objective is to produce an allocation of sellers goods to buyers as to maximize the total gain from trade. A commonly studied model of participant behavior is taken from the field of economic mechanism design [3, 4, 11]. In this model each player has a private valuation function that assigns real values to each possible allocation. The algorithm motivates players to participate truthfully by handing payments to them. The mechanism in an exchange collects buyer bids and seller bids and clears the exchange by computing:(i) a set of trades, and (ii) the payments made and received by players. In designing a mechanism to compute trades and payments we must consider the bidding strategies of self-interested players, i.e. rational players that follow expected-utility maximizing strategies. We set allocative efficiency as our primary goal. That is the mechanism must compute a set of trades that maximizes gain from trade. In addition we require individual rationality (IR) so that all players have positive expected utility to participate, budget balance (BB) so that the exchange does not run at a loss, and incentive compatibility (IC) so that reporting the truth is a dominant strategy for each player. Unfortunately, Myerson and Satterthwaites (1983) well known result demonstrates that in bilateral trade it is impossible to simultaneously achieve perfect efficiency, BB, and IR using an IC mechanism [10]. A unique approach to overcome Myerson and Satterthwaites impossibility result was attempted by Parkes, Kalagnanam and Eso [12]. This result designs both a regular and a combinatorial bilateral trade mechanism (which imposes BB and IR) that approximates truth revelation and allocation efficiency. In this paper we circumvent Myerson and Satterthwaites impossibility result by introducing a new model of negotiationrange markets. A negotiation-range mechanism does not produce payment prices for the market participants. Rather, is assigns each buyer-seller pair a price range, called Zone Of Possible Agreements (ZOPA). The buyer is provided with the high end of the range and the seller with the low end of the range. This allows the trading parties to engage in negotiation over the final price with guarantee that the deal is beneficial for both of them. The negotiation process is not considered part of the mechanism but left up to the interested parties, or to some external mechanism to perform. In effect a negotiation-range mechanism operates as a mediator between the market participants, offering them the grounds to be able to finalize the terms of the trade by themselves. This concept is natural to many real-world market environments such as the real estate market. 1 We focus on the single-unit heterogeneous setting: n sellers offer one unique good each by placing sealed bids specifying their willingness to sell, and m buyers, interested in buying a single good each, placing sealed bids specifying their willingness to pay for each good they may be interested in. Our main result is a single-unit heterogeneous bilateral trade negotiation-range mechanism (ZOPAS) that is efficient, individually rational, incentive compatible and budget balanced. Our result does not contradict Myerson and Satterthwaites important theorem. Myerson-Satterthwaites proof relies on a theorem assuring that in two different efficient IC markets; if the sellers have the same upper bound utility then they will receive the same prices in each market and if the buyers have the same lower bound utility then they will receive the same prices in each market. Our single-unit heterogeneous mechanism bypasses Myerson and Satterthwaites theorem by producing a price range, defined by a sellers floor and a buyers ceiling, for each pair of matched players. In our market mechanism the sellers upper bound utility may be the same while the sellers floor is different and the buyers lower bound utility may be the same while the buyers ceiling is different. Moreover, the final price is not fixed by the mechanism at all. Instead, it is determined by an independent negotiation between the buyer and seller. More specifically, in a negotiation-range mechanism, the range of prices each matched pair is given is resolved by a negotiation stage where a final price is determined. This negotiation stage is crucial for our mechanism to be IC. Intuitively, a negotiation range mechanism is incentive compatible if truth telling promises the best ZOPA from the point of view of the player in question. That is, he would tell the truth if this strategy maximizes the upper and lower bounds on his utility as expressed by the ZOPA boundaries. Yet, when carefully examined it turns out that it is impossible (by [10]) that this goal will always hold. This is simply because such a mechanism could be easily modified to determine final prices for the players (e.g. by taking the average of the ranges boundaries). Here, the negotiation stage come into play. We show that if the above utility maximizing condition does not hold then it is the case that the player cannot influence the negotiation bound that is assigned to his deal partner no matter what value he declares. This means that the only thing that he may achieve by reporting a false valuation is modifying his own negotiation bound, something that he could alternatively achieve by reporting his true valuation and incorporating the effect of the modified negotiation bound into his negotiation strategy. This eliminates the benefit of reporting false valuations and allows our mechanism to compute the optimal gain from trade according to the players true values. The problem of computing the optimal allocation which maximizes gain from trade can be conceptualized as the problem of finding the maximum weighted matching in a weighted bipartite graph connecting buyers and sellers, where each edge in the graph is assigned a weight equal to the difference between the respective buyer bid and seller bid. It is well known that this problem can be solved efficiently in polynomial time. VCG IC payment schemes [2, 7, 13] support efficient and IR bilateral trade but not simultaneously BB. Our particular approach adapts the VCG payment scheme to achieve budget balance. The philosophy of the VCG payment schemes in bilateral trade is that the buyer pays the sellers opportunity cost of not selling the good to another buyer and not keeping the good to herself. The seller is paid in addition to the buyers price a compensation for the damage the mechanism did to the seller by not extracting the buyers full bid. Our philosophy is a bit different: The seller is paid at least her opportunity cost of not selling the good to another buyer and not keeping the good for herself. The buyer pays at most his alternate sellers opportunity cost of not selling the good to another buyer and not keeping the alternate good for herself. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe our model and definitions. In section 3 we present the single-unit heterogeneous negotiation-range mechanism and show that it is efficient, IR, IC and BB. Finally, we conclude with a discussion in Section 4. 2. NEGOTIATION MARKETS PRELIMINARIES Let Π denote the set of players, N the set of n selling players, and M the set of m buying players, where Π = N ∪ M. Let Ψ = {1, ..., t} denote the set of goods. Let Ti ∈ {−1, 0, 1}t denote an exchange vector for a trade, such that player i buys goods {A ∈ Ψ|Ti (A) = 1} and sells goods {A ∈ Ψ|Ti (A) = −1}. Let T = (T1, ..., T|Π|) denote the complete trade between all players. We view T as describing the allocation of goods by the mechanism to the buyers and sellers. In the single-unit heterogeneous setting every good belongs to specific seller, and every buyer is interested in buying one good. The buyer may bid for several or all goods. At the end of the auction every good is either assigned to one of the buyers who bid for it or kept unsold by the seller. It is convenient to assume the sets of buyers and sellers are disjoint (though it is not required), i.e. N ∩ M = ∅. Each seller i is associated with exactly one good Ai, for which she has true valuation ci which expresses the price at which it is beneficial for her to sell the good. If the seller reports a false valuation at an attempt to improve the auction results for her, this valuation is denoted ˆci. A buyer has a valuation vector describing his valuation for each of the goods according to their owner. Specifically, vj(k) denotes buyer js valuation for good Ak. Similarly, if he reports a false valuation it is denoted ˆvj(k). If buyer j is matched by the mechanism with seller i then Ti(Ai) = −1 and Tj(Ai) = 1. Notice, that in our setting for every k = i, Ti(Ak) = 0 and Tj(Ai) = 0 and also for every z = j, Tz(Ai) = 0. For a matched buyer j - seller i pair, the gain from trade on the deal is defined as vj(i) − ci. Given and allocation T, the gain from trade associated with T is V = j∈M,i∈N (vj(i) − ci) · Tj(Ai). Let T∗ denote the optimal allocation which maximizes the gain from trade, computed according to the players true valuations. Let V ∗ denote the optimal gain from trade associated with this allocation. When players report false valuations we use ˆT∗ and ˆV ∗ to denote the optimal allocation and gain from trade, respectively, when computed according to the reported valuations. 2 We are interested in the design of negotiation-range mechanisms. In contrast to a standard auction mechanism where the buyer and seller are provided with the prices they should pay, the goal of a negotiation-range mechanism is to provide the players with a range of prices within which they can negotiate the final terms of the deal by themselves. The mechanism would provide the buyer with the upper bound on the range and the seller with the lower bound on the range. This gives each of them a promise that it will be beneficial for them to close the deal, but does not provide information about the other players terms of negotiation. Definition 1. Negotiation Range: Zone Of Possible Agreements, ZOPA, between a matched buyer and seller. The ZOPA is a range, (L, H), 0 ≤ L ≤ H, where H is an upper bound (ceiling) price for the buyer and L is a lower bound (floor) price for the seller. Definition 2. Negotiation-Range Mechanism: A mechanism that computes a ZOPA, (L, H), for each matched buyer and seller in T∗ , and provides the buyer with the upper bound H and the seller with the lower bound L. The basic assumption is that participants in the auction are self-interested players. That is their main goal is to maximize their expected utility. The utility for a buyer who does not participate in the trade is 0. If he does win some good, his utility is the surplus between his valuation for that good and the price he pays. For a seller, if she keeps the good unsold, her utility is just her valuation of the good, and the surplus is 0. If she gets to sell it, her utility is the price she is paid for it, and the surplus is the difference between this price and her valuation. Since negotiation-range mechanisms assign bounds on the range of prices rather than the final price, it is useful to define the upper and lower bounds on the players utilities defined by the ranges limits. Definition 3. Consider a buyer j - seller i pair matched by a negotiation-range mechanism and let (L, H) be their associated negotiation range. • The buyers top utility is: vj(i) − L, and the buyers bottom utility is vj(i) − H. • The sellers top utility is H, with surplus H − ci, and the sellers bottom utility is L, with surplus L − ci. 3. THE SINGLE-UNIT HETEROGENEOUS MECHANISM (ZOPAS) 3.1 Description of the Mechanism ZOPAS is a negotiation-range mechanism, it finds the optimal allocation T∗ and uses it to define a ZOPA for each buyer-seller pair. The first stage in applying the mechanism is for the buyers and sellers to submit their sealed bids. The mechanism then allocates buyers to sellers by computing the allocation T ∗ , which results in the optimal gain from trade V ∗ , and defines a ZOPA for each buyer-seller pair. Finally, buyers and sellers use the ZOPA to negotiate a final price. Computing T∗ involves solving the maximum weighted bipartite matching problem for the complete bipartite graph Kn,m constructed by placing the buyers on one side of the Find the optimal allocation T ∗ Compute the maximum weighted bipartite matching for the bipartite graph of buyers and sellers, and edge weights equal to the gain from trade. Calculate Sellers Floors For every buyer j, allocated good Ai Find the optimal allocation (T−j)∗ Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗ − V ∗ Calculate Buyers Ceilings For every buyer j, allocated good Ai Find the optimal allocation (T −i )∗ Find the optimal allocation (T −i −j )∗ Hj = vj(i) + (V −i −j )∗ − (V −i )∗ Negotiation Phase For every buyer j and every seller i of good Ai Report to seller i her floor Li and identify her matched buyer j Report to buyer j his ceiling Hj and identify his matched seller i i, j negotiate the goods final price Figure 1: The ZOPAS mechanism graph, the seller on another and giving the edge between buyer j and seller i weight equal to vj(i) − ci. The maximum weighted matching problem in solvable in polynomial time (e.g., using the Hungarian Method). This results in a matching between buyers and sellers that maximizes gain from trade. The next step is to compute for each buyer-seller pair a sellers floor, which provides the lower bound of the ZOPA for this pair, and assigns it to the seller. A sellers floor is computed by calculating the difference between the total gain from trade when the buyer is excluded and the total gain from trade of the other participants when the buyer is included (the VCG principle). Let (T−j)∗ denote the gain from trade of the optimal allocation when buyer js bids are discarded. Denote by (V−j)∗ the total gain from trade in the allocation (T−j)∗ . Definition 4. Seller Floor: The lowest price the seller should expect to receive, communicated to the seller by the mechanism. The seller floor for player i who was matched with buyer j on good Ai, i.e., Tj(Ai) = 1, is computed as: Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗ − V ∗ . The seller is instructed not to accept less than this price from her matched buyer. Next, the mechanism computes for each buyer-seller pair a buyer ceiling, which provides the upper bound of the ZOPA for this pair, and assigns it to the buyer. Each buyers ceiling is computed by removing the buyers matched seller and calculating the difference between the total gain from trade when the buyer is excluded and the total gain from trade of the other participants when the 3 buyer is included. Let (T−i )∗ denote the gain from trade of the optimal allocation when seller i is removed from the trade. Denote by (V −i )∗ the total gain from trade in the allocation (T−i )∗ . Let (T−i −j )∗ denote the gain from trade of the optimal allocation when seller i is removed from the trade and buyer js bids are discarded. Denote by (V −i −j )∗ the total gain from trade in the allocation (T −i −j )∗ . Definition 5. Buyer Ceiling: The highest price the seller should expect to pay, communicated to the buyer by the mechanism. The buyer ceiling for player j who was matched with seller i on good Ai, i.e., Tj(Ai) = 1, is computed as: Hj = vj(i) + (V −i −j )∗ − (V −i )∗ . The buyer is instructed not to pay more than this price to his matched seller. Once the negotiation range lower bound and upper bound are computed for every matched pair, the mechanism reports the lower bound price to the seller and the upper bound price to the buyer. At this point each buyer-seller pair negotiates on the final price and concludes the deal. A schematic description the ZOPAS mechanism is given in Figure 3.1. 3.2 Analysis of the Mechanism In this section we analyze the properties of the ZOPAS mechanism. Theorem 1. The ZOPAS market negotiation-range mechanism is an incentive-compatible bilateral trade mechanism that is efficient, individually rational and budget balanced. Clearly ZOPAS is an efficient polynomial time mechanism. Let us show it satisfies the rest of the properties in the theorem. Claim 1. ZOPAS is individually rational, i.e., the mechanism maintains nonnegative utility surplus for all participants. Proof. If a participant does not trade in the optimal allocation then his utility surplus is zero by definition. Consider a pair of buyer j and seller i which are matched in the optimal allocation T ∗ . Then the buyers utility is at least vj(i) − Hj. Recall that Hj = vj(i) + (V −i −j )∗ − (V −i )∗ , so that vj(i) − Hj = (V −i )∗ − (V −i −j )∗ . Since the optimal gain from trade which includes j is higher than that which does not, we have that the utility is nonnegative: vj(i) − Hj ≥ 0. Now, consider the seller i. Her utility surplus is at least Li − ci. Recall that Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗ − V ∗ . If we removed from the optimal allocation T ∗ the contribution of the buyer j - seller i pair, we are left with an allocation which excludes j, and has value V ∗ − (vj(i) − ci). This implies that (V−j)∗ ≥ V ∗ − vj(i) + ci, which implies that Li − ci ≥ 0. The fact that ZOPAS is a budget-balanced mechanism follows from the following lemma which ensures the validity of the negotiation range, i.e., that every sellers floor is below her matched buyers ceiling. This ensures that they can close the deal at a final price which lies in this range. Lemma 1. For every buyer j- seller i pair matched by the mechanism: Li ≤ Hj. Proof. Recall that Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗ − V ∗ and Hj = vj(i)+(V −i −j )∗ −(V −i )∗ . To prove that Li ≤ Hj it is enough to show that (V −i )∗ + (V−j)∗ ≤ V ∗ + (V −i −j )∗ . (1) The proof of (1) is based on a method which we apply several times in our analysis. We start with the allocations (T−i )∗ and (T−j)∗ which together have value equal to (V −i )∗ + (V−j)∗ . We now use them to create a pair of new valid allocations, by using the same pairs that were matched in the original allocations. This means that the sum of values of the new allocations is the same as the original pair of allocations. We also require that one of the new allocations does not include buyer j or seller i. This means that the sum of values of these new allocations is at most V ∗ + (V −i −j )∗ , which proves (1). Let G be the bipartite graph where the nodes on one side of G represent the buyers and the nodes on the other side represent the sellers, and edge weights represent the gain from trade for the particular pair. The different allocations represent bipartite matchings in G. It will be convenient for the sake of our argument to think of the edges that belong to each of the matchings as being colored with a specific color representing this matching. Assign color 1 to the edges in the matching (T −i )∗ and assign color 2 to the edges in the matching (T−j)∗ . We claim that these edges can be recolored using colors 3 and 4 so that the new coloring represents allocations T (represented by color 3) and (T−i −j ) (represented by color 4). This implies the that inequality (1) holds. Figure 2 illustrates the graph G and the colorings of the different matchings. Define an alternating path P starting at j. Let S1 be the seller matched to j in (T −i )∗ (if none exists then P is empty). Let B1 be the buyer matched to S1 in (T−j)∗ , S2 be the seller matched to B1 in (T−i )∗ , B2 be the buyer matched to S2 in (T−j)∗ , and so on. This defines an alternating path P, starting at j, whose edges colors alternate between colors 1 and 2 (starting with 1). This path ends either in a seller who is not matched in (T−j)∗ or in a buyer who is not matched in (T−i )∗ . Since all sellers in this path are matched in (T−i )∗ , we have that seller i does not belong to P. This ensures that edges in P may be colored by alternating colors 3 and 4 (starting with 3). Since except for the first edge, all others do not involve i or j and thus may be colored 4 and be part of an allocation (T −i −j ) . We are left to recolor the edges that do not belong to P. Since none of these edges includes j we have that the edges that were colored 1, which are part of (T −i )∗ , may now be colored 4, and be included in the allocation (T −i −j ) . It is also clear that the edges that were colored 2, which are part of (T−j)∗ , may now be colored 3, and be included in the allocation T . This completes the proof of the lemma. 3.3 Incentive Compatibility The basic requirement in mechanism design is for an exchange mechanism to be incentive compatible. This means that its payment structure enforces that truth-telling is the players weakly dominant strategy, that is that the strategy by which the player is stating his true valuation results 4 ... jS1 S2 B1 S3 B2 B3S4 S5 B4 S6 B5 S8 B7 S7 B6 ... Figure 2: Alternating path argument for Lemma 1 (Validity of the Negotiation Range) and Claim 2 (part of Buyers IC proof) Colors Bidders 1 32 4 UnmatchedMatched Figure 3: Key to Figure 2 in bigger or equal utility as any other strategy. The utility surplus is defined as the absolute difference between the players bid and his price. Negotiation-range mechanisms assign bounds on the range of prices rather than the final price and therefore the players valuation only influences the minimum and maximum bounds on his utility. For a buyer the minimum (bottom) utility would be based on the top of the negotiation range (ceiling), and the maximum (top) utility would be based on the bottom of the negotiation range (floor). For a seller its the other way around. Therefore the basic natural requirement from negotiation-range mechanisms would be that stating the players true valuation results in both the higher bottom utility and higher top utility for the player, compared with other strategies. Unfortunately, this requirement is still too strong and it is impossible (by [10]) that this will always hold. Therefore we slightly relax it as follows: we require this holds when the false valuation based strategy changes the players allocation. When the allocation stays unchanged we require instead that the player would not be able to change his matched players bound (e.g. a buyer cannot change the sellers floor). This means that the only thing he can influence is his own bound, something that he can alternatively achieve through means of negotiation. The following formally summarizes our incentive compatibility requirements from the negotiation-range mechanism. Buyers incentive compatibility: • Let j be a buyer matched with seller i by the mechanism according to valuation vj and the negotiationrange assigned is (Li, Hj). Assume that when the mechanism is applied according to valuation ˆvj, seller k = i is matched with j and the negotiation-range assigned is (ˆLk, ˆHj). Then vj(i) − Hj ≥ vj(k) − ˆHj. (2) vj(i) − Li ≥ vj(k) − ˆLk. (3) • Let j be a buyer not matched by the mechanism according to valuation vj. Assume that when the mechanism is applied according to valuation ˆvj, seller k = i is matched with j and the negotiation-range assigned is (ˆLk, ˆHj). Then vj(k) − ˆHj ≤ vj(k) − ˆLk ≤ 0. (4) • Let j be a buyer matched with seller i by the mechanism according to valuation vj and let the assigned bottom of the negotiation range (sellers floor) be Li. Assume that when the mechanism is applied according to valuation ˆvj, the matching between i and j remains unchanged and let the assigned bottom of the negotiation range (sellers floor) be ˆLi. Then, ˆLi = Li. (5) Notice that the first inequality of (4) always holds for a valid negotiation range mechanism (Lemma 1). Sellers incentive compatibility: • Let i be a seller not matched by the mechanism according to valuation ci. Assume that when the mechanism 5 is applied according to valuation ˆci, buyer z = j is matched with i and the negotiation-range assigned is (ˆLi, ˆHz). Then ˆLi − ci ≤ ˆHz − ci ≤ 0. (6) • Let i be a buyer matched with buyer j by the mechanism according to valuation ci and let the assigned top of the negotiation range (buyers ceiling) be Hj. Assume that when the mechanism is applied according to valuation ˆci, the matching between i and j remains unchanged and let the assigned top of the negotiation range (buyers ceiling) be ˆHj. Then, ˆHj = Hj. (7) Notice that the first inequality of (6) always holds for a valid negotiation range mechanism (Lemma 1). Observe that in the case of sellers in our setting, the case expressed by requirement (6) is the only case in which the seller may change the allocation to her benefit. In particular, it is not possible for seller i who is matched in T ∗ to change her buyer by reporting a false valuation. This fact simply follows from the observation that reducing the sellers valuation increases the gain from trade for the current allocation by at least as much than any other allocation, whereas increasing the sellers valuation decreases the gain from trade for the current allocation by exactly the same amount as any other allocation in which it is matched. Therefore, the only case the optimal allocation may change is when in the new allocation i is not matched in which case her utility surplus is 0. Theorem 2. ZOPAS is an incentive compatible negotiationrange mechanism. Proof. We begin with the incentive compatibility for buyers. Consider a buyer j who is matched with seller i according to his true valuation v. Consider that j is reporting instead a false valuation ˆv which results in a different allocation in which j is matched with seller k = i. The following claim shows that a buyer j which changed his allocation due to a false declaration of his valuation cannot improve his top utility. Claim 2. Let j be a buyer matched to seller i in T ∗ , and let k = i be the seller matched to j in ˆT∗ . Then, vj(i) − Hj ≥ vj(k) − ˆHj. (8) Proof. Recall that Hj = vj(i) + (V −i −j )∗ − (V −i )∗ and ˆHj = ˆvj(k) + ( ˆV −k −j )∗ − ( ˆV −k )∗ . Therefore, vj(i) − Hj = (V −i )∗ − (V −i −j )∗ and vj(k) − ˆHj = vj(k) − ˆvj(k) + ( ˆV −k )∗ − ( ˆV −k −j )∗ . It follows that in order to prove (8) we need to show ( ˆV −k )∗ + (V −i −j )∗ ≤ (V −i )∗ + ( ˆV −k −j )∗ + ˆvj(k) − vj(k). (9) Consider first the case were j is matched to i in ( ˆT−k )∗ . If we remove this pair and instead match j with k we obtain a matching which excludes i, if the gain from trade on the new pair is taken according to the true valuation then we get ( ˆV −k )∗ − (ˆvj(i) − ci) + (vj(k) − ck) ≤ (V −i )∗ . Now, since the optimal allocation ˆT∗ matches j with k rather than with i we have that (V −i −j )∗ + (ˆvj(i) − ci) ≤ ˆV ∗ = ( ˆV −k −j )∗ + (ˆvj(k) − ck), where we have used that ( ˆV −i −j )∗ = (V −i −j )∗ since these allocations exclude j. Adding up these two inequalities implies (9) in this case. It is left to prove (9) when j is not matched to i in ( ˆT−k )∗ . In fact, in this case we prove the stronger inequality ( ˆV −k )∗ + (V −i −j )∗ ≤ (V −i )∗ + ( ˆV −k −j )∗ . (10) It is easy to see that (10) indeed implies (9) since it follows from the fact that k is assigned to j in ˆT∗ that ˆvj(k) ≥ vj(k). The proof of (10) works as follows. We start with the allocations ( ˆT−k )∗ and (T−i −j )∗ which together have value equal to ( ˆV −k )∗ + (V −i −j )∗ . We now use them to create a pair of new valid allocations, by using the same pairs that were matched in the original allocations. This means that the sum of values of the new allocations is the same as the original pair of allocations. We also require that one of the new allocations does not include seller i and is based on the true valuation v, while the other allocation does not include buyer j or seller k and is based on the false valuation ˆv. This means that the sum of values of these new allocations is at most (V −i )∗ + ( ˆV −k −j )∗ , which proves (10). Let G be the bipartite graph where the nodes on one side of G represent the buyers and the nodes on the other side represent the sellers, and edge weights represent the gain from trade for the particular pair. The different allocations represent bipartite matchings in G. It will be convenient for the sake of our argument to think of the edges that belong to each of the matchings as being colored with a specific color representing this matching. Assign color 1 to the edges in the matching ( ˆT−k )∗ and assign color 2 to the edges in the matching (T −i −j )∗ . We claim that these edges can be recolored using colors 3 and 4 so that the new coloring represents allocations (T −i ) (represented by color 3) and ( ˆT−k −j ) (represented by color 4). This implies the that inequality (10) holds. Figure 2 illustrates the graph G and the colorings of the different matchings. Define an alternating path P starting at j. Let S1 = i be the seller matched to j in ( ˆT−k )∗ (if none exists then P is empty). Let B1 be the buyer matched to S1 in (T−i −j )∗ , S2 be the seller matched to B1 in ( ˆT−k )∗ , B2 be the buyer matched to S2 in (T−i −j )∗ , and so on. This defines an alternating path P, starting at j, whose edges colors alternate between colors 1 and 2 (starting with 1). This path ends either in a seller who is not matched in (T −i −j )∗ or in a buyer who is not matched in ( ˆT−k )∗ . Since all sellers in this path are matched in ( ˆT−k )∗ , we have that seller k does not belong to P. Since in this case S1 = i and the rest of the sellers in P are matched in (T−i −j )∗ we have that seller i as well does not belong to P. This ensures that edges in P may be colored by alternating colors 3 and 4 (starting with 3). Since S1 = i, we may use color 3 for the first edge and thus assign it to the allocation (T−i ) . All other edges, do not involve i, j or k and thus may be either colored 4 and be part of an allocation ( ˆT−k −j ) or colored 3 and be part of an allocation (T−i ) , in an alternating fashion. We are left to recolor the edges that do not belong to P. Since none of these edges includes j we have that the edges 6 that were colored 1, which are part of ( ˆT−k )∗ , may now be colored 4, and be included in the allocation ( ˆT−k −j ) . It is also clear that the edges that were colored 2, which are part of (T−i −j )∗ , may now be colored 3, and be included in the allocation (T−i ) . This completes the proof of (10) and the claim. The following claim shows that a buyer j which changed his allocation due to a false declaration of his valuation cannot improve his bottom utility. The proof is basically the standard VCG argument. Claim 3. Let j be a buyer matched to seller i in T ∗ , and k = i be the seller matched to j in ˆT∗ . Then, vj(i) − Li ≥ vj(k) − ˆLk. (11) Proof. Recall that Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗ − V ∗ , and ˆLk = ˆvj(k) + ( ˆV−j)∗ − ˆV ∗ = ˆvj(k) + (V−j)∗ − ˆV ∗ . Therefore, vj(i) − Li = V ∗ − (V−j)∗ and vj(k) − ˆLk = vj(k) − ˆvj(k) + ˆV ∗ − (V−j)∗ . It follows that in order to prove (11) we need to show V ∗ ≥ vj(k) − ˆvj(k) + ˆV ∗ . (12) The scenario of this claim occurs when j understates his value for Ai or overstated his value for Ak. Consider these two cases: • ˆvj(k) > vj(k): Since Ak was allocated to j in the allocation ˆT∗ we have that using the allocation of ˆT∗ according to the true valuation gives an allocation of value U satisfying ˆV ∗ − ˆvj(k) + vj(k) ≤ U ≤ V ∗ . • ˆvj(k) = vj(k) and ˆvj(i) < vj(i): In this case (12) reduces to V ∗ ≥ ˆV ∗ . Since j is not allocated i in ˆT∗ we have that ˆT∗ is an allocation that uses only true valuations. From the optimality of T ∗ we conclude that V ∗ ≥ ˆV ∗ . Another case in which a buyer may try to improve his utility is when he does not win any good by stating his true valuation. He may give a false valuation under which he wins some good. The following claim shows that doing this is not beneficial to him. Claim 4. Let j be a buyer not matched in T ∗ , and assume seller k is matched to j in ˆT∗ . Then, vj(k) − ˆLk ≤ 0. Proof. The scenario of this claim occurs if j did not buy in the truth-telling allocation and overstates his value for Ak, ˆvj(k) > vj(k) in his false valuation. Recall that ˆLk = ˆvj(k) + ( ˆV−j)∗ − ˆV ∗ . Thus we need to show that 0 ≥ vj(k) − ˆvj(k) + ˆV ∗ − (V−j)∗ . Since j is not allocated in T∗ then (V−j)∗ = V ∗ . Since j is allocated Ak in ˆT∗ we have that using the allocation of ˆT∗ according to the true valuation gives an allocation of value U satisfying ˆV ∗ − ˆvj(k) + vj(k) ≤ U ≤ V ∗ . Thus we can conclude that 0 ≥ vj(k) − ˆvj(k) + ˆV ∗ − (V−j)∗ . Finally, the following claim ensures that a buyer cannot influence the floor bound of the ZOPA for the good he wins. Claim 5. Let j be a buyer matched to seller i in T ∗ , and assume that ˆT∗ = T∗ , then ˆLi = Li. Proof. Recall that Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗ − V ∗ , and ˆLi = ˆvj(i) + ( ˆV−j)∗ − ˆV ∗ = ˆvj(i) + (V−j)∗ − ˆV ∗ . Therefore we need to show that ˆV ∗ = V ∗ + ˆvj(i) − vj(i). Since j is allocated Ai in T∗ , we have that using the allocation of T∗ according to the false valuation gives an allocation of value U satisfying V ∗ − vj(i) + ˆvj(i) ≤ U ≤ ˆV ∗ . Similarly since j is allocated Ai in ˆT∗ , we have that using the allocation of ˆT∗ according to the true valuation gives an allocation of value U satisfying ˆV ∗ − ˆvj(i)+vj(i) ≤ U ≤ V ∗ , which together with the previous inequality completes the proof. This completes the analysis of the buyers incentive compatibility. We now turn to prove the sellers incentive compatibility properties of our mechanism. The following claim handles the case where a seller that was not matched in T ∗ falsely understates her valuation such that she gets matched n ˆT∗ . Claim 6. Let i be a seller not matched in T ∗ , and assume buyer z is matched to i in ˆT∗ . Then, ˆHz − ci ≤ 0. Proof. Recall that ˆHz = vz(i) + ( ˆV −i −z )∗ − ( ˆV −i )∗ . Since i is not matched in T ∗ and ( ˆT−i )∗ involves only true valuations we have that ( ˆV −i )∗ = V ∗ . Since i is matched with z in ˆT∗ it can be obtained by adding the buyer z - seller i pair to ( ˆT−i −z)∗ . It follows that ˆV ∗ = ( ˆV −i −z )∗ + vz(i) − ˆci. Thus, we have that ˆHz = ˆV ∗ + ˆci − V ∗ . Now, since i is matched in ˆT∗ , using this allocation according to the true valuation gives an allocation of value U satisfying ˆV ∗ + ˆci − ci ≤ U ≤ V ∗ . Therefore ˆHz −ci = ˆV ∗ +ˆci −V ∗ −ci ≤ 0. Finally, the following simple claim ensures that a seller cannot influence the ceiling bound of the ZOPA for the good she sells. Claim 7. Let i be a seller matched to buyer j in T ∗ , and assume that ˆT∗ = T∗ , then ˆHj = Hj. Proof. Since ( ˆV −i −j )∗ = (V −i −j )∗ and ( ˆV −i )∗ = (V −i )∗ it follows that ˆHj = vj(i)+( ˆV −i −j )∗ −( ˆV −i )∗ = vj(i)+(V −i −j )∗ −(V −i )∗ = Hj. 4. CONCLUSIONS AND EXTENSIONS In this paper we suggest a way to deal with the impossibility of producing mechanisms which are efficient, individually rational, incentive compatible and budget balanced. To this aim we introduce the concept of negotiation-range mechanisms which avoid the problem by leaving the final determination of prices to a negotiation between the buyer and seller. The goal of the mechanism is to provide the initial range (ZOPA) for negotiation in a way that it will be beneficial for the participants to close the proposed deals. We present a negotiation range mechanism that is efficient, individually rational, incentive compatible and budget balanced. The ZOPA produced by our mechanism is based 7 on a natural adaptation of the VCG payment scheme in a way that promises valid negotiation ranges which permit a budget balanced allocation. The basic question that we aimed to tackle seems very exciting: which properties can we expect a market mechanism to achieve ? Are there different market models and requirements from the mechanisms that are more feasible than classic mechanism design goals ? In the context of our negotiation-range model, is natural to further study negotiation based mechanisms in more general settings. A natural extension is that of a combinatorial market. Unfortunately, finding the optimal allocation in a combinatorial setting is NP-hard, and thus the problem of maintaining BB is compounded by the problem of maintaining IC when efficiency is approximated [1, 5, 6, 9, 11]. Applying the approach in this paper to develop negotiationrange mechanisms for combinatorial markets, even in restricted settings, seems a promising direction for research. 5. REFERENCES [1] Y.

Introducción En este documento presentamos el concepto de mecanismos basados en la negociación en el contexto de la teoría de los mercados veraces eficientes. Un mercado consta de múltiples compradores y vendedores que desean intercambiar productos. El objetivo principal del mercado es producir una asignación de bienes de vendedores a los compradores para maximizar la ganancia total del comercio. Un modelo de comportamiento de los participantes comúnmente estudiado se toma del campo del diseño del mecanismo económico [3, 4, 11]. En este modelo, cada jugador tiene una función de valoración privada que asigna valores reales a cada posible asignación. El algoritmo motiva a los jugadores a participar con sinceridad al entregarles los pagos. El mecanismo en un intercambio recauda ofertas de compradores y ofertas del vendedor y borra el intercambio mediante la informática: (i) un conjunto de operaciones, y (ii) los pagos realizados y recibidos por los jugadores. Al diseñar un mecanismo para calcular los oficios y los pagos, debemos considerar las estrategias de licitación de los jugadores interesados, es decir, los jugadores racionales que siguen las estrategias de maximización de la utilidad esperada. Establecemos la eficiencia de asignación como nuestro objetivo principal. Ese es el mecanismo debe calcular un conjunto de operaciones que maximice la ganancia del comercio. Además, requerimos la racionalidad individual (IR) para que todos los jugadores tengan una utilidad esperada positiva para participar, el equilibrio presupuestario (BB) para que el intercambio no se ejecute en una pérdida y la compatibilidad de incentivos (IC) para que informar la verdad sea un dominanteEstrategia para cada jugador. Desafortunadamente, Myerson y Satterthwaites (1983) bien conocido resultado demuestran que en el comercio bilateral es imposible lograr simultáneamente una eficiencia perfecta, BB e IR utilizando un mecanismo IC [10]. Parkes, Kalagnanam y ESO [12] intentaron un enfoque único para superar a Myerson y Satterthwaites Resultado de imposibilidad. Este resultado diseña un mecanismo de comercio bilateral regular y combinatorio (que impone BB e IR) que se aproxima a la revelación de la verdad y la eficiencia de la asignación. En este documento, el resultado de Myerson y Satterthwaites, el resultado de la imposibilidad al introducir un nuevo modelo de mercados de rango de negociación. Un mecanismo de rango de negociación no produce precios de pago para los participantes del mercado. Más bien, IS asigna a cada par de compradores-vendedor un rango de precios, llamado zona de posibles acuerdos (ZOPA). El comprador cuenta con el extremo superior de la gama y el vendedor con el extremo inferior de la gama. Esto permite que las partes comerciales participen en la negociación sobre el precio final con garantía de que el acuerdo es beneficioso para ambos. El proceso de negociación no se considera parte del mecanismo, sino que se deja a las partes interesadas, o a algún mecanismo externo para realizar. En efecto, un mecanismo de rango de negociación opera como mediador entre los participantes del mercado, ofreciéndoles los motivos para poder finalizar los términos del comercio por sí mismos. Este concepto es natural para muchos entornos del mercado del mundo real, como el mercado inmobiliario.1 Nos centramos en el entorno heterogéneo de una sola unidad: los vendedores de N ofrecen un bien único cada uno al colocar ofertas selladas especificando su disposición a vender, y M compradores, interesados en comprar un solo bien cada uno, colocando ofertas selladas especificando su voluntad de pagar cada uno para pagar cada unoBueno, pueden estar interesados. Nuestro resultado principal es un mecanismo de rango de negociación comercial bilateral de una sola unidad que es eficiente, individualmente racional, compatible con incentivos y presupuesto equilibrado. Nuestro resultado no contradice a Myerson y Satterthwaites teoremas importantes. La prueba de Myerson-SatterthWaites se basa en un teorema que asegura que en dos mercados IC eficientes diferentes;Si los vendedores tienen la misma utilidad límite superior, recibirá los mismos precios en cada mercado y si los compradores tienen la misma utilidad límite inferior, entonces recibirán los mismos precios en cada mercado. Nuestro mecanismo heterogéneo de una sola unidad evita el teorema de Myerson y SatterthWaites al producir un rango de precios, definido por un piso de vendedores y un techo de compradores, para cada par de jugadores coincidentes. En nuestro mecanismo de mercado, la empresa de servicios públicos con límite superior de vendedores puede ser el mismo, mientras que el piso de los vendedores es diferente y la utilidad límite inferior de los compradores puede ser la misma, mientras que el techo de los compradores es diferente. Además, el precio final no está fijado por el mecanismo en absoluto. En cambio, está determinado por una negociación independiente entre el comprador y el vendedor. Más específicamente, en un mecanismo de rango de negociación, el rango de precios cada par emparejado se resuelve mediante una etapa de negociación donde se determina un precio final. Esta etapa de negociación es crucial para que nuestro mecanismo sea IC. Intuitivamente, un mecanismo de rango de negociación es compatible con un incentivo si la verdad que data promete la mejor zapa desde el punto de vista del jugador en cuestión. Es decir, diría la verdad si esta estrategia maximiza los límites superiores e inferiores de su utilidad expresado por los límites de Zopa. Sin embargo, cuando se examina cuidadosamente, resulta que es imposible (por [10]) que este objetivo siempre tendrá. Esto se debe simplemente a que dicho mecanismo podría modificarse fácilmente para determinar los precios finales para los jugadores (por ejemplo, tomando el promedio de los límites de los rangos). Aquí, la etapa de negociación entra en juego. Mostramos que si la condición de maximización de la utilidad anterior no se mantiene, entonces es el caso de que el jugador no pueda influir en el límite de negociación que se asigna a su compañero de acuerdo sin importar qué valor declare. Esto significa que lo único que puede lograr informando una valoración falsa es modificar su propia negociación, algo que podría lograr alternativamente informando su verdadera valoración e incorporando el efecto de la negociación modificada vinculada a su estrategia de negociación. Esto elimina el beneficio de informar valoraciones falsas y permite que nuestro mecanismo calcule la ganancia óptima del comercio de acuerdo con los valores verdaderos de los jugadores. El problema de calcular la asignación óptima que maximiza la ganancia del comercio puede conceptualizarse como el problema de encontrar la coincidencia de peso máxima en un gráfico bipartito ponderado que conecta a compradores y vendedores, donde a cada borde en el gráfico se le asigna un peso igual a la diferencia entre la diferencia entre elOferta del comprador respectivo y oferta del vendedor. Es bien sabido que este problema se puede resolver de manera eficiente en el tiempo polinomial. Los esquemas de pago de VCG IC [2, 7, 13] apoyan el comercio eficiente e bilateral IR pero no simultáneamente BB. Nuestro enfoque particular adapta el esquema de pago VCG para lograr el saldo presupuestario. La filosofía de los esquemas de pago de VCG en el comercio bilateral es que el comprador paga el costo de oportunidad de los vendedores de no vender lo bueno a otro comprador y no mantener el bien para sí misma. Se paga al vendedor además del precio de los compradores una compensación por el daño que el mecanismo le hizo al vendedor al no extraer la oferta completa de los compradores. Nuestra filosofía es un poco diferente: al vendedor se le paga al menos su costo de oportunidad de no vender lo bueno a otro comprador y no mantener el bien para sí misma. El comprador paga como máximo su costo de oportunidad de vendedores alternativos de no vender lo bueno a otro comprador y no mantener el bien alternativo para sí misma. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 describimos nuestro modelo y definiciones. En la Sección 3 presentamos el mecanismo de rango de negociación heterogéneo de una sola unidad y mostramos que es eficiente, IR, IC y BB. Finalmente, concluimos con una discusión en la Sección 4. 2. Los mercados de negociación preliminares dejan que π denote el conjunto de jugadores, n el conjunto de n jugadores de venta, y M el conjunto de m jugadores de compra, donde π = n ∪ M. Sea ψ = {1, ..., t} denota el conjuntode bienes. Sea ti ∈ {−1, 0, 1} t denota un vector de intercambio para un comercio, de modo que el jugador i compra bienes {a ∈ ψ | ti (a) = 1} y vende bienes {a ∈ ψ | ti (a)= −1}. Deje t = (t1, ..., t | π |) denota el comercio completo entre todos los jugadores. Vemos que T describe la asignación de bienes por parte del mecanismo a los compradores y vendedores. En el entorno heterogéneo de una sola unidad, todo bien pertenece al vendedor específico, y cada comprador está interesado en comprar uno bien. El comprador puede ofertar por varios o todos los bienes. Al final de la subasta, cada bien se asigna a uno de los compradores que ofertaron por ella o que el vendedor no venda. Es conveniente asumir que los conjuntos de compradores y vendedores son disjuntos (aunque no es obligatorio), es decir, N ∩ m = ∅. Cada vendedor I está asociado con exactamente una buena IA, para la cual tiene verdadera valoración CI que expresa el precio al que es beneficioso para ella vender el bien. Si el vendedor informa una valoración falsa en un intento de mejorar los resultados de la subasta para ella, esta valoración se denota ˆci. Un comprador tiene un vector de valoración que describe su valoración para cada uno de los bienes según su propietario. Específicamente, VJ (k) denota la valoración del comprador JS para el buen AK. Del mismo modo, si informa una valoración falsa, se denota ˆVj (k). Si el Comprador J coincide con el Mecanismo con el Vendedor I, entonces Ti (Ai) = −1 y Tj (Ai) = 1. Observe que en nuestra configuración para cada k = i, ti (ak) = 0 y tj (ai) = 0 y también para cada z = j, tz (ai) = 0. Para un comprador J - Vendedor I de pareja, la ganancia del comercio en el acuerdo se define como VJ (i) - CI. Dada y asignación t, la ganancia del comercio asociada con t es V = j∈M, i∈N (vj (i) - ci) · tj (ai). Deje que T ∗ denote la asignación óptima que maximiza la ganancia del comercio, calculada de acuerdo con los jugadores de las verdaderas valoraciones. Deje que V ∗ denote la ganancia óptima del comercio asociada con esta asignación. Cuando los jugadores informan valoraciones falsas, usamos ˆT ∗ y ˆV ∗ para denotar la asignación y ganancia óptimas del comercio, respectivamente, cuando se calculan de acuerdo con las valoraciones informadas.2 Estamos interesados en el diseño de mecanismos de rango de negociación. A diferencia de un mecanismo de subasta estándar en el que el comprador y el vendedor reciben los precios que deben pagar, el objetivo de un mecanismo de rango de negociación es proporcionar a los jugadores una variedad de precios dentro de los cuales pueden negociar los términos finales del acuerdopor ellos mismos. El mecanismo proporcionaría al comprador el límite superior en el rango y el vendedor con el límite inferior en el rango. Esto les da una promesa de que será beneficioso para ellos cerrar el acuerdo, pero no proporciona información sobre los términos de negociación de otros jugadores. Definición 1. Rango de negociación: Zona de posibles acuerdos, Zopa, entre un comprador y un vendedor coincidentes. El ZOPA es un rango, (L, H), 0 ≤ L ≤ H, donde H es un precio superior (techo) de límite superior para el comprador y L es un precio de límite inferior (piso) para el vendedor. Definición 2. Mecanismo de rango de negociación: un mecanismo que calcula una zapa, (l, h), para cada comprador y vendedor coincidentes en t ∗, y proporciona al comprador el límite superior H y el vendedor con el límite inferior L. La suposición básica esque los participantes en la subasta son jugadores interesados. Ese es su objetivo principal es maximizar su utilidad esperada. La utilidad para un comprador que no participa en el comercio es 0. Si gana algo bien, su utilidad es el excedente entre su valoración por ese bien y el precio que paga. Para un vendedor, si mantiene el bien no vendido, su utilidad es solo su valoración del bien, y el excedente es 0. Si puede venderlo, su utilidad es el precio que le pagan, y el excedente es la diferencia entre este precio y su valoración. Dado que los mecanismos de rango de negociación asignan límites en el rango de precios en lugar del precio final, es útil definir los límites superiores e inferiores en los servicios públicos de los jugadores definidos por los límites de los rangos. Definición 3. Considere un comprador J - Vendedor que emparejó con un mecanismo de rango de negociación y deje que (L, H) sea su rango de negociación asociado.• La utilidad superior de los compradores es: VJ (i) - L, y la utilidad inferior de los compradores es VJ (i) - H. • La utilidad superior de los vendedores es H, con excedente H - CI, y la utilidad inferior de los vendedores es l, conexcedente l - ci.3. El mecanismo heterogéneo de una sola unidad (Zopas) 3.1 Descripción del mecanismo Zopas es un mecanismo de rango de negociación, encuentra la asignación óptima t ∗ y lo usa para definir una zapa para cada par de vendedores comprador. La primera etapa para aplicar el mecanismo es que los compradores y vendedores presenten sus ofertas selladas. Luego, el mecanismo asigna a los compradores a los vendedores calculando la asignación t ∗, lo que resulta en la ganancia óptima del comercio V ∗, y define una zapa para cada par de vendedores del comprador. Finalmente, los compradores y los vendedores usan la Zopa para negociar un precio final. La computación t ∗ implica resolver el problema de coincidencia bipartita máxima ponderado para el gráfico bipartito completo KN, M construido colocando a los compradores en un lado de la asignación óptima t ∗ calcula la coincidencia bipartita ponderada máxima para el gráfico bipartito de compradores y vendedores,y pesos de borde iguales a la ganancia del comercio. Calcule los pisos de los vendedores para cada comprador j, asignado bueno ai Encuentre la asignación óptima (t - j) ∗ li = vj (i) + (v - j) ∗ - v ∗ calcule los techos de los compradores para cada comprador j, asignado bueno ai encuentre el lugar.Asignación óptima (t −i) ∗ Encuentre la asignación óptima (t −i −j) ∗ hj = vj (i) + (v −i −j) ∗ - (v −i) ∗ fase de negociación para cada comprador j y cada unoVendedor I del buen informe de IA al vendedor I su piso li e identifica su informe comprador j -comprador al comprador j su techo HJ e identifica a su vendedor emparejado I I, J negocia el precio final de los bienes Figura 1: El gráfico del mecanismo de Zopas, el vendedor en otroy dar la ventaja entre el comprador J y el peso del vendedor I igual a VJ (i) - Ci. El problema de correspondencia ponderado máximo en solución en tiempo polinomial (por ejemplo, utilizando el método húngaro). Esto da como resultado una coincidencia entre compradores y vendedores que maximiza la ganancia del comercio. El siguiente paso es calcular para cada par de vendedores de comprador un piso de vendedores, que proporciona el límite inferior de la zapa para este par, y lo asigna al vendedor. Se calcula un piso de vendedores calculando la diferencia entre la ganancia total del comercio cuando se excluye el comprador y la ganancia total del comercio de los otros participantes cuando se incluye el comprador (el principio de VCG). Sea (t - j) ∗ denotar la ganancia del comercio de la asignación óptima cuando las ofertas del comprador JS se descartan. Denota por (v - j) ∗ la ganancia total del comercio en la asignación (t - j) ∗. Definición 4. Piso del vendedor: el precio más bajo que el vendedor debe esperar recibir, comunicado al vendedor por el mecanismo. El piso del vendedor para el jugador I que fue emparejado con el comprador J en la buena ai, es decir, tj (ai) = 1, se calcula como: li = vj (i) + (v - j) ∗ - v ∗. Se le indica al vendedor que no acepte menos de este precio de su comprador coincidente. A continuación, el mecanismo calcula para cada comprador-vendedor de un techo del comprador, que proporciona el límite superior de la zapa para este par, y lo asigna al comprador. Cada techo de compradores se calcula eliminando al vendedor de compradores y calculando la diferencia entre la ganancia total del comercio cuando se excluye el comprador y la ganancia total del comercio de los otros participantes cuando se incluye el comprador. Sea (t - i) ∗ denotar la ganancia del comercio de la asignación óptima cuando el vendedor I se elimina del comercio. Denota por (V −i) ∗ La ganancia total del comercio en la asignación (T - I) ∗. Sea (T - I −J) ∗ denotar la ganancia del comercio de la asignación óptima cuando el Vendedor I se elimina del comercio y se descartan las ofertas del comprador JS. Denota por (v −i −j) ∗ la ganancia total del comercio en la asignación (t −i −j) ∗. Definición 5. Techo del comprador: el precio más alto que el vendedor debe esperar pagar, comunicado al comprador por el mecanismo. El techo del comprador para el jugador j que fue emparejado con el vendedor I en buena ai, es decir, tj (ai) = 1, se calcula como: hj = vj (i) + (v −i −j) ∗ - (v −i)∗. Se le indica al comprador que no pague más que este precio a su vendedor igualado. Una vez que se calculan el rango de negociación inferior y el límite superior para cada par coincidente, el mecanismo informa el precio límite inferior al vendedor y el precio límite superior al comprador. En este punto, cada par de compradores-vendedor negocia el precio final y concluye el acuerdo. Una descripción esquemática El mecanismo de Zopas se da en la Figura 3.1.3.2 Análisis del mecanismo En esta sección Analizamos las propiedades del mecanismo de Zopas. Teorema 1. El mecanismo de rango de negociación del mercado de Zopas es un mecanismo comercial bilateral compatible con incentivos que es eficiente, individualmente racional y presupuestado equilibrado. Claramente, Zopas es un mecanismo de tiempo polinómico eficiente. Mostremos que satisface el resto de las propiedades en el teorema. Reclamación 1. Zopas es individualmente racional, es decir, el mecanismo mantiene el excedente de utilidad no negativo para todos los participantes. Prueba. Si un participante no intercambia la asignación óptima, entonces su excedente de utilidad es cero por definición. Considere un par de compradores J y vendedor I que coinciden en la asignación óptima t ∗. Entonces la utilidad de los compradores es al menos VJ (i) - HJ. Recuerde que hj = vj (i) + (v −i −j) ∗ - (v −i) ∗, de modo que vj (i) - hj = (v −i) ∗ - (v −i −j) ∗. Dado que la ganancia óptima del comercio que incluye J es mayor que la que no lo hace, tenemos que la utilidad no es negativa: VJ (I) - Hj ≥ 0. Ahora, considere al vendedor i. Su excedente de utilidad es al menos Li - Ci. Recuerde que li = vj (i) + (v - j) ∗ - v ∗. Si nos eliminamos de la asignación óptima t ∗ la contribución del par del vendedor J - Vendedor I, nos queda una asignación que excluye J, y tiene valor V ∗ - (VJ (i) - Ci). Esto implica que (V - J) ∗ ≥ V ∗ - Vj (I) + Ci, lo que implica que Li - Ci ≥ 0. El hecho de que Zopas sea un mecanismo de equilibrio presupuestario del siguiente lema que garantiza la validez del rango de negociación, es decir, que cada piso de vendedores está por debajo de su techo de compradores combinado. Esto asegura que puedan cerrar el trato a un precio final que se encuentra en este rango. Lema 1. Para cada comprador J- Vendedor, me par que coinciden con el mecanismo: li ≤ hj. Prueba. Recuerde que li = vj (i) + (v - j) ∗ - v ∗ y hj = vj (i) + (v −i −j) ∗ - (v −i) ∗. Para demostrar que li ≤ hj es suficiente para mostrar que (v −i) ∗ + (v - j) ∗ ≤ v ∗ + (v −i −j) ∗.(1) La prueba de (1) se basa en un método que aplicamos varias veces en nuestro análisis. Comenzamos con las asignaciones (t - I) ∗ y (t - j) ∗ que juntas tienen un valor igual a (v −i) ∗ + (v - j) ∗. Ahora los usamos para crear un par de nuevas asignaciones válidas, utilizando los mismos pares que coincidían en las asignaciones originales. Esto significa que la suma de los valores de las nuevas asignaciones es la misma que el par original de asignaciones. También requerimos que una de las nuevas asignaciones no incluya el Comprador J o el Vendedor I. Esto significa que la suma de los valores de estas nuevas asignaciones es como máximo V ∗ + (V −i −j) ∗, lo que demuestra (1). Deje que G sea el gráfico bipartito donde los nodos en un lado de G representan a los compradores y los nodos en el otro lado representan a los vendedores, y los pesos de borde representan la ganancia del comercio para el par en particular. Las diferentes asignaciones representan coincidencias bipartitas en G. Será conveniente por el argumento de nuestro argumento pensar en los bordes que pertenecen a cada una de las coincidencias como coloreadas con un color específico que representa esta coincidencia. Asigne color 1 a los bordes en la coincidencia (t −i) ∗ y asigne el color 2 a los bordes en la coincidencia (t - j) ∗. Afirmamos que estos bordes se pueden recolorar utilizando los colores 3 y 4 para que la nueva coloración represente las asignaciones t (representadas por el color 3) y (t - j) (representado por el color 4). Esto implica que la desigualdad (1) se mantiene. La Figura 2 ilustra el gráfico G y las coloraciones de las diferentes coincidencias. Defina una ruta alterna P que comienza en j. Sea S1 el vendedor emparejado con J en (t −i) ∗ (si ninguno existe, entonces p está vacío). Deje que B1 sea el comprador emparejado con S1 en (T - J) ∗, S2 sea el vendedor emparejado con B1 en (T - I) ∗, B2 será el comprador emparejado con S2 en (T - J) ∗, y así sucesivamente. Esto define una ruta alterna P, comenzando en J, cuyos colores se alternan entre los colores 1 y 2 (comenzando con 1). Esta ruta termina en un vendedor que no coincide con (T - J) ∗ o en un comprador que no coincide en (T - I) ∗. Dado que todos los vendedores en este camino coinciden en (T - I) ∗, tenemos ese vendedor I no pertenece a P. Esto asegura que los bordes en P puedan estar coloreados por los colores alternativos 3 y 4 (comenzando con 3). Dado que excepto el primer borde, todos los demás no involucran I o J y, por lo tanto, pueden colorear 4 y ser parte de una asignación (t −i −j). Nos quedamos para recolorar los bordes que no pertenecen a P. ya que ninguno de estos bordes incluye j, tenemos que los bordes que fueron coloreados 1, que son parte de (t −i) ∗, ahora pueden estar coloreados 4 y serincluido en la asignación (t −i −j). También está claro que los bordes que fueron coloreados 2, que son parte de (T - J) ∗, ahora pueden estar coloreados 3 y se incluyen en la asignación t. Esto completa la demostración del lema.3.3 Compatibilidad de incentivos El requisito básico en el diseño del mecanismo es que un mecanismo de intercambio sea compatible con incentivos. Esto significa que su estructura de pago aplica que la verdadera de la verdad es la estrategia de los jugadores débilmente dominante, es decir, la estrategia por la cual el jugador está declarando sus verdaderos resultados de valoración 4 ...

El excedente de servicios públicos se define como la diferencia absoluta entre la oferta de jugadores y su precio. Los mecanismos de rango de negociación asignan límites en el rango de precios en lugar del precio final y, por lo tanto, la valoración de los jugadores solo influye en los límites mínimos y máximos en su utilidad. Para un comprador, la utilidad mínima (inferior) se basaría en la parte superior del rango de negociación (techo), y la utilidad máxima (superior) se basaría en la parte inferior del rango de negociación (piso). Para un vendedor es al revés. Por lo tanto, el requisito natural básico de los mecanismos de rango de negociación sería que indicar que la verdadera valoración de los jugadores da como resultado la utilidad inferior superior y la utilidad superior superior para el jugador, en comparación con otras estrategias. Desafortunadamente, este requisito sigue siendo demasiado fuerte y es imposible (por [10]) que esto siempre se mantendrá. Por lo tanto, lo relajamos ligeramente de la siguiente manera: requerimos que esto se mantenga cuando la estrategia basada en la valoración falsa cambia la asignación de jugadores. Cuando la asignación permanece sin cambios, requerimos que el jugador no pueda cambiar a sus jugadores coincidentes (por ejemplo, un comprador no puede cambiar el piso de los vendedores). Esto significa que lo único que puede influir es su propio encuadernación, algo que puede lograr alternativamente a través de medios de negociación. El siguiente resume formalmente nuestros requisitos de compatibilidad de incentivos del mecanismo de rango de negociación. Compatibilidad de incentivos de compradores: • Sea que J sea un comprador igualado con el vendedor I por el mecanismo de acuerdo con la valoración VJ y el range de negociación asignado es (Li, HJ). Suponga que cuando el mecanismo se aplica de acuerdo con la valoración ˆVJ, el vendedor K = I se combina con J y la rango de negociación asignada es (ˆlk, ˆhj). Entonces Vj (i) - Hj ≥ Vj (K) - - - --Hj.(2) VJ (I) - Li ≥ VJ (K) - - ˆlk.(3) • Sea J un comprador no igualado por el mecanismo de acuerdo con la valoración VJ. Suponga que cuando el mecanismo se aplica de acuerdo con la valoración ˆVJ, el vendedor K = I se combina con J y la rango de negociación asignada es (ˆlk, ˆhj). Entonces vj (k) - ˆhj ≤ vj (k) - ˆlk ≤ 0. (4) • Sea J un comprador igualado con el vendedor I por el mecanismo de acuerdo con la valoración VJ y deje que el fondo asignado del rango de negociación (piso de los vendedores)ser li. Suponga que cuando el mecanismo se aplica de acuerdo con la valoración ˆVJ, la coincidencia entre I y J permanece sin cambios y deja que el fondo asignado del rango de negociación (piso de vendedores) sea ˆli. Entonces, ˆli = li.(5) Observe que la primera desigualdad de (4) siempre es válida para un mecanismo de rango de negociación válido (Lemma 1). Vendedores Compatibilidad de incentivos: • Que yo sea un vendedor no igualado por el mecanismo de acuerdo con la valoración del CI. Suponga que cuando el mecanismo 5 se aplica de acuerdo con la valoración ˆci, el comprador z = j se combina con I y la rango de negociación asignada es (ˆli, ˆhz). Entonces ˆli - Ci ≤ ˆhz - Ci ≤ 0. (6) • Sea un comprador igualado con el comprador J por el mecanismo de acuerdo con la valoración de CI y deje que la parte superior asignada del rango de negociación (techo de compradores) sea HJ. Suponga que cuando el mecanismo se aplica de acuerdo con la valoración ˆci, la coincidencia entre I y J permanece sin cambios y deja que la parte superior asignada del rango de negociación (techo de compradores) sea ˆHJ. Entonces, ˆhj = Hj.(7) Observe que la primera desigualdad de (6) siempre es válida para un mecanismo de rango de negociación válido (Lemma 1). Observe que en el caso de los vendedores en nuestro entorno, el caso expresado por el requisito (6) es el único caso en el que el vendedor puede cambiar la asignación a su beneficio. En particular, no es posible que el vendedor I sea igualado en t ∗ cambiar a su comprador informando una valoración falsa. Este hecho simplemente se deduce de la observación de que reducir la valoración de los vendedores aumenta la ganancia del comercio para la asignación actual en al menos tanto que cualquier otra asignación, mientras que el aumento de la valoración de los vendedores disminuye la ganancia del comercio para la asignación actual en la misma cantidad de la misma cantidad.como cualquier otra asignación en la que se coincida. Por lo tanto, el único caso que la asignación óptima puede cambiar es cuando en la nueva asignación no coincide en cuyo caso su excedente de utilidad es 0. Teorema 2. Zopas es un mecanismo de rango de negociación compatible con incentivos. Prueba. Comenzamos con la compatibilidad de incentivos para los compradores. Considere un comprador J que se corresponde con el vendedor I de acuerdo con su verdadera valoración v. Considere que J está informando en lugar de una falsa valoración ˆv que resulta en una asignación diferente en la que J se combina con el vendedor K = i. La siguiente afirmación muestra que un comprador J que cambió su asignación debido a una falsa declaración de su valoración no puede mejorar su utilidad superior. Reclamación 2. Deje que J sea un comprador emparejado con el vendedor I en t ∗, y deje que K = yo sea el vendedor emparejado con j en ˆt ∗. Entonces, vj (i) - hj ≥ vj (k) - - --hj.(8) Prueba. Recuerde que hj = vj (i) + (v −i −j) ∗ - (v −i) ∗ y ˆhj = ˆvj (k) + (ˆv −k −j) ∗ - (ˆv −k) ∗. Por lo tanto, vj (i) - hj = (v −i) ∗ - (v −i −j) ∗ y vj (k) - ˆhj = vj (k) - ˆvj (k) + (ˆv −k) ∗ - ((ˆV −k −j) ∗. Se deduce que para probar (8) necesitamos mostrar (ˆv −k) ∗ + (v −i −j) ∗ ≤ (v −i) ∗ + (ˆv −k −j) ∗ + ˆvj (k)- VJ (k).(9) Considere primero que el caso J fue que J se combina con I en (ˆT - K) ∗. Si eliminamos este par y en su lugar coinciden con K con K, obtenemos una coincidencia que excluye i, si la ganancia del comercio en el nuevo par se toma de acuerdo con la valoración verdadera, entonces obtenemos (ˆv −k) ∗ - (ˆVJ (i)- ci) + (vj (k) - ck) ≤ (v −i) ∗. Ahora, dado que la asignación óptima ˆt ∗ coincide con j con k en lugar de con i tenemos que (v −i −j) ∗ + (ˆvj (i) - ci) ≤ ˆv ∗ = (ˆv −k −j) ∗ + (ˆVj (k) - ck), donde hemos usado eso (ˆv −i −j) ∗ = (v −i −j) ∗ ya que estas asignaciones excluyen j. Sumar estas dos desigualdades implica (9) en este caso. Se deja probar (9) cuando J no coincide con i en (ˆt - k) ∗. De hecho, en este caso probamos la desigualdad más fuerte (ˆv −k) ∗ + (v −i −j) ∗ ≤ (v −i) ∗ + (ˆv −k −j) ∗.(10) Es fácil ver que (10) de hecho implica (9) ya que se deduce del hecho de que K se asigna a J en ˆT ∗ que ˆvJ (k) ≥ Vj (k). La prueba de (10) funciona de la siguiente manera. Comenzamos con las asignaciones (ˆT - K) ∗ y (t - i −j) ∗ que en conjunto tienen un valor igual a (ˆv −k) ∗ + (v −i −j) ∗. Ahora los usamos para crear un par de nuevas asignaciones válidas, utilizando los mismos pares que coincidían en las asignaciones originales. Esto significa que la suma de los valores de las nuevas asignaciones es la misma que el par original de asignaciones. También requerimos que una de las nuevas asignaciones no incluya el Vendedor I y se basa en la verdadera valoración V, mientras que la otra asignación no incluye el Comprador J o el Vendedor K y se basa en la Valoración Falsa ˆV. Esto significa que la suma de los valores de estas nuevas asignaciones es como máximo (V −i) ∗ + (ˆv −k −j) ∗, que prueba (10). Deje que G sea el gráfico bipartito donde los nodos en un lado de G representan a los compradores y los nodos en el otro lado representan a los vendedores, y los pesos de borde representan la ganancia del comercio para el par en particular. Las diferentes asignaciones representan coincidencias bipartitas en G. Será conveniente por el argumento de nuestro argumento pensar en los bordes que pertenecen a cada una de las coincidencias como coloreadas con un color específico que representa esta coincidencia. Asigne color 1 a los bordes en la coincidencia (ˆT - K) ∗ y asigne el color 2 a los bordes en la coincidencia (t −i −j) ∗. Afirmamos que estos bordes se pueden volver a colorear con los colores 3 y 4 para que la nueva coloración represente las asignaciones (t −i) (representadas por el color 3) y (ˆt -k −j) (representado por el color 4). Esto implica que la desigualdad (10) se mantiene. La Figura 2 ilustra el gráfico G y las coloraciones de las diferentes coincidencias. Defina una ruta alterna P que comienza en j. Sea s1 = ser el vendedor emparejado con j en (ˆt - k) ∗ (si ninguno existe, entonces p está vacío). Sea B1 el comprador emparejado con S1 en (T - I −j) ∗, S2 S2 el vendedor coincidente con B1 en (ˆT - K) ∗, B2 sea el comprador coincidente con S2 en (t - i −j) ∗,etcétera. Esto define una ruta alterna P, comenzando en J, cuyos colores se alternan entre los colores 1 y 2 (comenzando con 1). Esta ruta termina en un vendedor que no coincide con (t −i −j) ∗ o en un comprador que no coincide con (ˆt - k) ∗. Dado que todos los vendedores en esta ruta coinciden en (ˆT - K) ∗, tenemos que el vendedor K no pertenece a P. ya que en este caso S1 = I y el resto de los vendedores en P se combinan en (T - I - -J) ∗ Tenemos ese vendedor I también no pertenece a P. Esto asegura que los bordes en P puedan estar coloreados por los colores alternativos 3 y 4 (comenzando con 3). Como S1 = I, podemos usar el color 3 para el primer borde y así asignarlo a la asignación (T - I). Todos los demás bordes, no involucran i, j o k y, por lo tanto, pueden estar coloreados 4 y ser parte de una asignación (ˆt - k −j) o color 3 y ser parte de una asignación (t -i), en una alternativamoda. Nos quedamos para recolorar los bordes que no pertenecen a P. ya que ninguno de estos bordes incluye j, tenemos que los bordes 6 que fueron coloreados 1, que son parte de (ˆt - k) ∗, ahora pueden estar coloreados 4, yser incluido en la asignación (ˆT - K −j). También está claro que los bordes que estaban coloreados 2, que son parte de (T - I −j) ∗, ahora pueden estar coloreados 3 y se deben incluir en la asignación (T - I). Esto completa la prueba de (10) y el reclamo. La siguiente afirmación muestra que un comprador J que cambió su asignación debido a una falsa declaración de su valoración no puede mejorar su utilidad inferior. La prueba es básicamente el argumento VCG estándar. Reclamación 3. Deje que J sea un comprador emparejado con el vendedor I en t ∗, y k = yo soy el vendedor emparejado con j en ˆt ∗. Entonces, vj (i) - li ≥ vj (k) - - - ˆlk.(11) Prueba. Recuerde que li = vj (i) + (v - j) ∗ - v ∗, y ˆlk = ˆvj (k) + (ˆv - j) ∗ - ˆv ∗ = ˆvj (k) + (v - j) ∗ - ˆv∗. Por lo tanto, vj (i) - li = v ∗ - (v - j) ∗ y vj (k) - ˆlk = vj (k) - ˆvj (k) + ˆv ∗ - (v - j) ∗. Se deduce que para probar (11) necesitamos mostrar v ∗ ≥ vj (k) - ˆvj (k) + ˆv ∗.(12) El escenario de esta afirmación ocurre cuando J subestima su valor para la IA o exageró su valor para AK. Considere estos dos casos: • ˆvj (k)> vj (k): Dado que AK se asignó a J en la asignación ˆT ∗, tenemos que utilizando la asignación de ˆT ∗ de acuerdo con la verdadera valoración proporciona una asignación de valor u satisfaciendo ˆV ∗- ˆvj (k) + vj (k) ≤ u ≤ v ∗.• ˆvj (k) = Vj (k) y ˆvj (i) <vj (i): en este caso (12) se reduce a v ∗ ≥ ˆv ∗. Dado que J no está asignado i en ˆT ∗ tenemos que ˆt ∗ es una asignación que solo usa valoraciones verdaderas. De la optimización de t ∗ concluimos que v ∗ ≥ ˆv ∗. Otro caso en el que un comprador puede intentar mejorar su utilidad es cuando no gana ningún bien al afirmar su verdadera valoración. Puede dar una valoración falsa bajo la cual gana algo bueno. La siguiente afirmación muestra que hacer esto no es beneficioso para él. Reclamación 4. Deje que J sea un comprador no coincidente en t ∗, y suponga que el vendedor K se corresponde con j en ˆt ∗. Entonces, vj (k) - ˆlk ≤ 0. Prueba. El escenario de esta afirmación ocurre si J no compró en la asignación de la verdad y exagera su valor para AK, ˆVJ (k)> vj (k) en su falsa valoración. Recuerde que ˆlk = ˆvj (k) + (ˆv - j) ∗ - ˆv ∗. Por lo tanto, debemos mostrar que 0 ≥ vj (k) - ˆvj (k) + ˆv ∗ - (v - j) ∗. Dado que J no se asigna en T ∗ entonces (V - J) ∗ = V ∗. Dado que J se asigna AK en ˆT ∗, tenemos que utilizando la asignación de ˆT ∗ de acuerdo con la valoración verdadera da una asignación de valor U que satisface ˆv ∗ - ˆvj (k) + vj (k) ≤ u ≤ v ∗. Por lo tanto, podemos concluir que 0 ≥ vj (k) - ˆvj (k) + ˆv ∗ - (v - j) ∗. Finalmente, la siguiente afirmación asegura que un comprador no pueda influir en el piso del Zopa para el bien que gana. Reclamación 5. Sea J un comprador emparejado con el vendedor I en t ∗, y suponga que ˆt ∗ = t ∗, entonces ˆli = li. Prueba. Recuerde que li = vj (i) + (v - j) ∗ - v ∗, y ˆli = ˆvj (i) + (ˆv - j) ∗ - ˆv ∗ = ˆvj (i) + (v - j) ∗ - ˆv∗. Por lo tanto, debemos mostrar que ˆV ∗ = V ∗ + ˆVj (i) - Vj (i). Dado que J se asigna ai en t ∗, tenemos que usar la asignación de t ∗ de acuerdo con la valoración falsa proporciona una asignación de valor u que satisface v ∗ - vj (i) + ˆvj (i) ≤ u ≤ ˆv ∗. Del mismo modo, dado que J se asigna ai en ˆT ∗, tenemos eso usando la asignación de ˆT ∗ de acuerdo con la valoración verdadera da una asignación de valor U que satisface ˆV ∗ - ˆvj (i)+vj (i) ≤ u ≤ v ∗, queJunto con la desigualdad anterior completa la prueba. Esto completa el análisis de la compatibilidad de incentivos de los compradores. Ahora recurrimos a demostrar las propiedades de compatibilidad de incentivos de los vendedores de nuestro mecanismo. El siguiente reclamo maneja el caso en el que un vendedor que no se coincidía en t ∗ subestima falsamente su valoración de tal manera que se coincida con n ˆt ∗. Reclamación 6. Que yo sea un vendedor que no sea igualado en t ∗, y suponga que el comprador z coincide con i en ˆt ∗. Entonces, ˆhz - ci ≤ 0. Prueba. Recuerde que ˆhz = vz (i) + (ˆv −i −z) ∗ - (ˆv −i) ∗. Dado que I no coincide en t ∗ y (ˆt - i) ∗ implica solo valoraciones verdaderas que tenemos que (ˆv −i) ∗ = v ∗. Dado que I coincide con z en ˆt ∗, se puede obtener agregando el par de compradores z - vendedor i par a (ˆt - i −z) ∗. Se deduce que ˆV ∗ = (ˆV −i −z) ∗ + vz (i) - ˆci. Por lo tanto, tenemos que ˆhz = ˆv ∗ + ˆci - v ∗. Ahora, dado que I coincide en ˆT ∗, el uso de esta asignación de acuerdo con la valoración verdadera da una asignación de valor U que satisface ˆv ∗ + ˆci - ci ≤ u ≤ v ∗. Por lo tanto, ˆhz −ci = ˆV ∗ +ˆci −v ∗ −ci ≤ 0. Finalmente, el siguiente reclamo simple asegura que un vendedor no pueda influir en el límite del techo de la Zopa para el bien que vende. Reclamación 7. Sea un vendedor emparejado con el comprador j en t ∗, y suponga que ˆt ∗ = t ∗, entonces ˆhj = hj. Prueba. Ya que (ˆv −i −j) ∗ = (v −i −j) ∗ y (ˆv −i) ∗ = (v −i) ∗ se deduce que ˆhj = vj (i)+(ˆV −i −j) ∗ ∗- (ˆv −i) ∗ = Vj (i)+(V −i −j) ∗ - (V −i) ∗ = Hj.4. Conclusiones y extensiones En este documento, sugerimos una forma de lidiar con la imposibilidad de producir mecanismos que sean eficientes, individualmente racionales, compatibles con incentivos y presupuesto equilibrado. Con este objetivo, presentamos el concepto de mecanismos de rango de negociación que evitan el problema al dejar la determinación final de los precios a una negociación entre el comprador y el vendedor. El objetivo del mecanismo es proporcionar el rango inicial (ZOPA) para la negociación de una manera que sea beneficioso que los participantes cierren los acuerdos propuestos. Presentamos un mecanismo de rango de negociación que es eficiente, individualmente racional, compatible con incentivos y presupuesto equilibrado. La Zopa producida por nuestro mecanismo se basa 7 en una adaptación natural del esquema de pago VCG de una manera que promete rangos de negociación válidos que permiten una asignación de presupuesto equilibrada. La pregunta básica que nuestro objetivo es abordar parece muy emocionante: ¿qué propiedades podemos esperar que logre un mecanismo de mercado? ¿Hay diferentes modelos de mercado y requisitos de los mecanismos que son más factibles que los objetivos de diseño de mecanismo clásico? En el contexto de nuestro modelo de rango de negociación, es natural para estudiar más mecanismos basados en la negociación en entornos más generales. Una extensión natural es la de un mercado combinatorio. Desafortunadamente, encontrar la asignación óptima en una configuración combinatoria es NP-HARD y, por lo tanto, el problema de mantener BB se ve agravado por el problema de mantener IC cuando se aproxima la eficiencia [1, 5, 6, 9, 11]. Aplicar el enfoque en este documento para desarrollar mecanismos de rango de negociación para los mercados combinatorios, incluso en entornos restringidos, parece una dirección prometedora para la investigación.5.

        "We set allocative efficiency as our primary goal.",
        "That is the mechanism must compute a set of trades that maximizes gain from trade.",
        "In addition we require individual rationality (IR) so that all players have positive expected utility to participate, budget balance (BB) so that the exchange does not run at a loss, and incentive compatibility (IC) so that reporting the truth is a dominant strategy for each player.",
        "Unfortunately, Myerson and Satterthwaites (1983) well known result demonstrates that in bilateral trade it is impossible to simultaneously achieve perfect efficiency, BB, and IR using an IC mechanism [10].",

        "This concept is natural to many real-world market environments such as the real estate market. 1 We focus on the single-unit heterogeneous setting: n sellers offer one unique good each by placing sealed bids specifying their willingness to sell, and m buyers, interested in buying a single good each, placing sealed bids specifying their willingness to pay for each good they may be interested in.",

        "Instead, it is determined by an independent negotiation between the buyer and seller.",
        "More specifically, in a negotiation-range mechanism, the range of prices each matched pair is given is resolved by a negotiation stage where a final price is determined.",

        "Intuitively, a negotiation range mechanism is incentive compatible if truth telling promises the best ZOPA from the point of view of the player in question.",
        "That is, he would tell the truth if this strategy maximizes the upper and lower bounds on his utility as expressed by the ZOPA boundaries.",
        "Yet, when carefully examined it turns out that it is impossible (by [10]) that this goal will always hold.",
        "This is simply because such a mechanism could be easily modified to determine final prices for the players (e.g. by taking the average of the ranges boundaries).",
        "Here, the negotiation stage come into play.",
        "We show that if the above utility maximizing condition does not hold then it is the case that the player cannot influence the negotiation bound that is assigned to his deal partner no matter what value he declares.",
        "This means that the only thing that he may achieve by reporting a false valuation is modifying his own negotiation bound, something that he could alternatively achieve by reporting his true valuation and incorporating the effect of the modified negotiation bound into his negotiation strategy.",
        "This eliminates the benefit of reporting false valuations and allows our mechanism to compute the optimal gain from trade according to the players true values.",
        "The problem of computing the optimal allocation which maximizes gain from trade can be conceptualized as the problem of finding the maximum weighted matching in a weighted bipartite graph connecting buyers and sellers, where each edge in the graph is assigned a weight equal to the difference between the respective buyer bid and seller bid.",

        "For a seller its the other way around.",
        "Therefore the basic natural requirement from negotiation-range mechanisms would be that stating the players true valuation results in both the higher bottom utility and higher top utility for the player, compared with other strategies.",
        "Unfortunately, this requirement is still too strong and it is impossible (by [10]) that this will always hold.",
        "Therefore we slightly relax it as follows: we require this holds when the false valuation based strategy changes the players allocation.",
        "When the allocation stays unchanged we require instead that the player would not be able to change his matched players bound (e.g. a buyer cannot change the sellers floor).",

        "In particular, it is not possible for seller i who is matched in T ∗ to change her buyer by reporting a false valuation.",
        "This fact simply follows from the observation that reducing the sellers valuation increases the gain from trade for the current allocation by at least as much than any other allocation, whereas increasing the sellers valuation decreases the gain from trade for the current allocation by exactly the same amount as any other allocation in which it is matched.",
        "Therefore, the only case the optimal allocation may change is when in the new allocation i is not matched in which case her utility surplus is 0.",

        "It follows that in order to prove (8) we need to show ( ˆV −k )∗ + (V −i −j )∗ ≤ (V −i )∗ + ( ˆV −k −j )∗ + ˆvj(k) − vj(k). (9) Consider first the case were j is matched to i in ( ˆT−k )∗ .",
        "If we remove this pair and instead match j with k we obtain a matching which excludes i, if the gain from trade on the new pair is taken according to the true valuation then we get ( ˆV −k )∗ − (ˆvj(i) − ci) + (vj(k) − ck) ≤ (V −i )∗ .",
        "Now, since the optimal allocation ˆT∗ matches j with k rather than with i we have that (V −i −j )∗ + (ˆvj(i) − ci) ≤ ˆV ∗ = ( ˆV −k −j )∗ + (ˆvj(k) − ck), where we have used that ( ˆV −i −j )∗ = (V −i −j )∗ since these allocations exclude j.",

        "Consider these two cases: • ˆvj(k) > vj(k): Since Ak was allocated to j in the allocation ˆT∗ we have that using the allocation of ˆT∗ according to the true valuation gives an allocation of value U satisfying ˆV ∗ − ˆvj(k) + vj(k) ≤ U ≤ V ∗ . • ˆvj(k) = vj(k) and ˆvj(i) < vj(i): In this case (12) reduces to V ∗ ≥ ˆV ∗ .",

                "That is the mechanism must compute a set of trades that maximizes gain from trade.",

                "Unfortunately, Myerson and Satterthwaites (1983) well known result demonstrates that in bilateral trade it is impossible to simultaneously achieve perfect efficiency, BB, and IR using an IC mechanism [10].",

                "A commonly studied model of participant behavior is taken from the field of economic mechanism design [3, 4, 11].",
                "In this model each player has a private valuation function that assigns real values to each possible allocation.",
                "The algorithm motivates players to participate truthfully by handing payments to them.",
                "The mechanism in an exchange collects buyer bids and seller bids and clears the exchange by computing:(i) a set of trades, and (ii) the payments made and received by players.",
                "In designing a mechanism to compute trades and payments we must consider the bidding strategies of self-interested players, i.e. rational players that follow expected-utility maximizing strategies.",
                "We set allocative efficiency as our primary goal.",
                "That is the mechanism must compute a set of trades that maximizes gain from trade.",
                "In addition we require individual rationality (IR) so that all players have positive expected utility to participate, budget balance (BB) so that the exchange does not run at a loss, and incentive compatibility (IC) so that reporting the truth is a dominant strategy for each player.",
                "Unfortunately, Myerson and Satterthwaites (1983) well known result demonstrates that in bilateral trade it is impossible to simultaneously achieve perfect efficiency, BB, and IR using an IC mechanism [10].",

                "More specifically, in a negotiation-range mechanism, the range of prices each matched pair is given is resolved by a negotiation stage where a final price is determined.",
                "This negotiation stage is crucial for our mechanism to be IC.",

                "A market consists of multiple buyers and sellers who wish to exchange goods.",
                "The markets main objective is to produce an allocation of sellers goods to buyers as to maximize the total gain from trade.",
                "A commonly studied model of participant behavior is taken from the field of economic mechanism design [3, 4, 11].",
                "In this model each player has a private valuation function that assigns real values to each possible allocation.",
                "The algorithm motivates players to participate truthfully by handing payments to them.",
                "The mechanism in an exchange collects buyer bids and seller bids and clears the exchange by computing:(i) a set of trades, and (ii) the payments made and received by players.",
                "In designing a mechanism to compute trades and payments we must consider the bidding strategies of self-interested players, i.e. rational players that follow expected-utility maximizing strategies.",
                "We set allocative efficiency as our primary goal.",
                "That is the mechanism must compute a set of trades that maximizes gain from trade.",
                "In addition we require <br>individual rationality</br> (IR) so that all players have positive expected utility to participate, budget balance (BB) so that the exchange does not run at a loss, and incentive compatibility (IC) so that reporting the truth is a dominant strategy for each player.",
                "Unfortunately, Myerson and Satterthwaites (1983) well known result demonstrates that in bilateral trade it is impossible to simultaneously achieve perfect efficiency, BB, and IR using an IC mechanism [10].",
                "A unique approach to overcome Myerson and Satterthwaites impossibility result was attempted by Parkes, Kalagnanam and Eso [12].",
                "This result designs both a regular and a combinatorial bilateral trade mechanism (which imposes BB and IR) that approximates truth revelation and allocation efficiency.",
                "In this paper we circumvent Myerson and Satterthwaites impossibility result by introducing a new model of negotiationrange markets.",
                "A negotiation-range mechanism does not produce payment prices for the market participants.",
                "Rather, is assigns each buyer-seller pair a price range, called Zone Of Possible Agreements (ZOPA).",
                "The buyer is provided with the high end of the range and the seller with the low end of the range.",
                "This allows the trading parties to engage in negotiation over the final price with guarantee that the deal is beneficial for both of them.",
                "The negotiation process is not considered part of the mechanism but left up to the interested parties, or to some external mechanism to perform.",
                "In effect a negotiation-range mechanism operates as a mediator between the market participants, offering them the grounds to be able to finalize the terms of the trade by themselves.",
                "This concept is natural to many real-world market environments such as the real estate market. 1 We focus on the single-unit heterogeneous setting: n sellers offer one unique good each by placing sealed bids specifying their willingness to sell, and m buyers, interested in buying a single good each, placing sealed bids specifying their willingness to pay for each good they may be interested in.",
                "Our main result is a single-unit heterogeneous bilateral trade negotiation-range mechanism (ZOPAS) that is efficient, individually rational, incentive compatible and budget balanced.",
                "Our result does not contradict Myerson and Satterthwaites important theorem.",
                "Myerson-Satterthwaites proof relies on a theorem assuring that in two different efficient IC markets; if the sellers have the same upper bound utility then they will receive the same prices in each market and if the buyers have the same lower bound utility then they will receive the same prices in each market.",
                "Our single-unit heterogeneous mechanism bypasses Myerson and Satterthwaites theorem by producing a price range, defined by a sellers floor and a buyers ceiling, for each pair of matched players.",

                "Moreover, the final price is not fixed by the mechanism at all.",
                "Instead, it is determined by an independent negotiation between the buyer and seller.",
                "More specifically, in a negotiation-range mechanism, the range of prices each matched pair is given is resolved by a negotiation stage where a final price is determined.",
                "This negotiation stage is crucial for our mechanism to be IC.",
                "Intuitively, a negotiation range mechanism is incentive compatible if truth telling promises the best ZOPA from the point of view of the player in question.",
                "That is, he would tell the truth if this strategy maximizes the upper and lower bounds on his utility as expressed by the ZOPA boundaries.",
                "Yet, when carefully examined it turns out that it is impossible (by [10]) that this goal will always hold.",
                "This is simply because such a mechanism could be easily modified to determine final prices for the players (e.g. by taking the average of the ranges boundaries).",
                "Here, the negotiation stage come into play.",
                "We show that if the above utility maximizing condition does not hold then it is the case that the player cannot influence the negotiation bound that is assigned to his deal partner no matter what value he declares.",
                "This means that the only thing that he may achieve by reporting a false valuation is modifying his own negotiation bound, something that he could alternatively achieve by reporting his true valuation and incorporating the effect of the modified negotiation bound into his negotiation strategy.",
                "This eliminates the benefit of reporting false valuations and allows our mechanism to compute the optimal gain from trade according to the players true values.",
                "The problem of computing the optimal allocation which maximizes gain from trade can be conceptualized as the problem of finding the maximum weighted matching in a weighted bipartite graph connecting buyers and sellers, where each edge in the graph is assigned a weight equal to the difference between the respective buyer bid and seller bid.",

                "The markets main objective is to produce an allocation of sellers goods to buyers as to maximize the total gain from trade.",
                "A commonly studied model of participant behavior is taken from the field of economic mechanism design [3, 4, 11].",
                "In this model each player has a private valuation function that assigns real values to each possible allocation.",
                "The algorithm motivates players to participate truthfully by handing payments to them.",
                "The mechanism in an exchange collects buyer bids and seller bids and clears the exchange by computing:(i) a set of trades, and (ii) the payments made and received by players.",
                "In designing a mechanism to compute trades and payments we must consider the bidding strategies of self-interested players, i.e. rational players that follow expected-utility maximizing strategies.",
                "We set allocative efficiency as our primary goal.",
                "That is the mechanism must compute a set of trades that maximizes gain from trade.",
                "In addition we require individual rationality (IR) so that all players have positive expected utility to participate, budget balance (BB) so that the exchange does not run at a loss, and <br>incentive compatibility</br> (IC) so that reporting the truth is a dominant strategy for each player.",
                "Unfortunately, Myerson and Satterthwaites (1983) well known result demonstrates that in bilateral trade it is impossible to simultaneously achieve perfect efficiency, BB, and IR using an IC mechanism [10].",

                "In effect a negotiation-range mechanism operates as a mediator between the market participants, offering them the grounds to be able to finalize the terms of the trade by themselves.",
                "This concept is natural to many real-world market environments such as the real estate market. 1 We focus on the single-unit heterogeneous setting: n sellers offer one unique good each by placing sealed bids specifying their willingness to sell, and m buyers, interested in buying a single good each, placing sealed bids specifying their willingness to pay for each good they may be interested in.",

                "Myerson-Satterthwaites proof relies on a theorem assuring that in two different efficient IC markets; if the sellers have the same upper bound utility then they will receive the same prices in each market and if the buyers have the same lower bound utility then they will receive the same prices in each market.",

                "More specifically, in a negotiation-range mechanism, the range of prices each matched pair is given is resolved by a negotiation stage where a final price is determined.",
                "This negotiation stage is crucial for our mechanism to be IC.",
                "Intuitively, a negotiation range mechanism is incentive compatible if truth telling promises the best ZOPA from the point of view of the player in question.",

                "Yet, when carefully examined it turns out that it is impossible (by [10]) that this goal will always hold.",
                "This is simply because such a mechanism could be easily modified to determine final prices for the players (e.g. by taking the average of the ranges boundaries).",

                "This means that the only thing that he may achieve by reporting a false valuation is modifying his own negotiation bound, something that he could alternatively achieve by reporting his true valuation and incorporating the effect of the modified negotiation bound into his negotiation strategy.",

                "The problem of computing the optimal allocation which maximizes gain from trade can be conceptualized as the problem of finding the maximum weighted matching in a weighted bipartite graph connecting buyers and sellers, where each edge in the graph is assigned a weight equal to the difference between the respective buyer bid and seller bid.",

                "That is the mechanism must compute a set of trades that maximizes gain from trade.",

                "That is the mechanism must compute a set of trades that maximizes gain from trade.",
                "In addition we require individual rationality (IR) so that all players have positive expected utility to participate, budget balance (BB) so that the exchange does not run at a loss, and incentive compatibility (IC) so that reporting the truth is a dominant strategy for each player.",

                "That is the mechanism must compute a set of trades that maximizes gain from trade.",
                "In addition we require individual rationality (IR) so that all players have positive expected utility to participate, budget balance (BB) so that the exchange does not run at a loss, and incentive compatibility (IC) so that reporting the truth is a dominant strategy for each player.",
                "Unfortunately, Myerson and Satterthwaites (1983) well known result demonstrates that in bilateral trade it is impossible to simultaneously achieve perfect efficiency, BB, and IR using an IC mechanism [10].",

                "The markets main objective is to produce an allocation of sellers goods to buyers as to maximize the total gain from trade.",
                "A commonly studied model of participant behavior is taken from the field of economic mechanism design [3, 4, 11].",
                "In this model each player has a private valuation function that assigns real values to each possible allocation.",
                "The algorithm motivates players to participate truthfully by handing payments to them.",
                "The mechanism in an exchange collects buyer bids and seller bids and clears the exchange by computing:(i) a set of trades, and (ii) the payments made and received by players.",
                "In designing a mechanism to compute trades and payments we must consider the bidding strategies of self-interested players, i.e. rational players that follow expected-utility maximizing strategies.",
                "We set allocative efficiency as our primary goal.",
                "That is the mechanism must compute a set of trades that maximizes gain from trade.",
                "In addition we require individual rationality (IR) so that all players have positive expected utility to participate, budget balance (BB) so that the exchange does not run at a loss, and incentive compatibility (IC) so that reporting the truth is a dominant strategy for each player.",
                "Unfortunately, Myerson and Satterthwaites (1983) well known result demonstrates that in bilateral trade it is impossible to simultaneously achieve perfect efficiency, BB, and IR using an IC mechanism [10].",

                "This means that the only thing that he may achieve by reporting a false valuation is modifying his own negotiation bound, something that he could alternatively achieve by reporting his true valuation and incorporating the effect of the modified negotiation bound into his negotiation strategy.",

                "The problem of computing the optimal allocation which maximizes gain from trade can be conceptualized as the problem of finding the maximum weighted matching in a weighted bipartite graph connecting buyers and sellers, where each edge in the graph is assigned a weight equal to the difference between the respective buyer bid and seller bid.",

                "That is the mechanism must compute a set of trades that maximizes gain from trade.",

                "The markets main objective is to produce an allocation of sellers goods to buyers as to maximize the total gain from trade.",
                "A commonly studied model of participant behavior is taken from the field of economic mechanism design [3, 4, 11].",
                "In this model each player has a private valuation function that assigns real values to each possible allocation.",
                "The algorithm motivates players to participate truthfully by handing payments to them.",
                "The mechanism in an exchange collects buyer bids and seller bids and clears the exchange by computing:(i) a set of trades, and (ii) the payments made and received by players.",
                "In designing a mechanism to compute trades and payments we must consider the bidding strategies of self-interested players, i.e. rational players that follow expected-utility maximizing strategies.",
                "We set allocative efficiency as our primary goal.",
                "That is the mechanism must compute a set of trades that maximizes gain from trade.",
                "In addition we require individual rationality (IR) so that all players have positive expected utility to participate, budget balance (BB) so that the exchange does not run at a loss, and incentive compatibility (IC) so that reporting the truth is a dominant strategy for each player.",
                "Unfortunately, Myerson and Satterthwaites (1983) well known result demonstrates that in bilateral trade it is impossible to simultaneously achieve perfect efficiency, BB, and IR using an IC mechanism [10].",

                "Rather, is assigns each buyer-seller pair a price range, called Zone Of Possible Agreements (ZOPA).",
                "The buyer is provided with the high end of the range and the seller with the low end of the range.",

                "This concept is natural to many real-world market environments such as the real estate market. 1 We focus on the single-unit heterogeneous setting: n sellers offer one unique good each by placing sealed bids specifying their willingness to sell, and m buyers, interested in buying a single good each, placing sealed bids specifying their willingness to pay for each good they may be interested in.",

                "The markets main objective is to produce an allocation of sellers goods to buyers as to maximize the total gain from trade.",
                "A commonly studied model of participant behavior is taken from the field of economic mechanism design [3, 4, 11].",
                "In this model each player has a private valuation function that assigns real values to each possible allocation.",
                "The algorithm motivates players to participate truthfully by handing payments to them.",
                "The mechanism in an exchange collects buyer bids and seller bids and clears the exchange by computing:(i) a set of trades, and (ii) the payments made and received by players.",
                "In designing a mechanism to compute trades and payments we must consider the bidding strategies of self-interested players, i.e. rational players that follow expected-utility maximizing strategies.",
                "We set allocative efficiency as our primary goal.",
                "That is the mechanism must compute a set of trades that maximizes gain from trade.",
                "In addition we require individual rationality (IR) so that all players have positive expected utility to participate, budget balance (BB) so that the exchange does not run at a loss, and incentive compatibility (IC) so that reporting the truth is a dominant strategy for each player.",
                "Unfortunately, Myerson and Satterthwaites (1983) well known result demonstrates that in bilateral trade it is impossible to simultaneously achieve perfect efficiency, BB, and IR using an IC mechanism [10].",

                "This concept is natural to many real-world market environments such as the real estate market. 1 We focus on the single-unit heterogeneous setting: n sellers offer one unique good each by placing sealed bids specifying their willingness to sell, and m buyers, interested in buying a single good each, placing sealed bids specifying their willingness to pay for each good they may be interested in.",

                "It follows that in order to prove (8) we need to show ( ˆV −k )∗ + (V −i −j )∗ ≤ (V −i )∗ + ( ˆV −k −j )∗ + ˆvj(k) − vj(k). (9) Consider first the case were j is matched to i in ( ˆT−k )∗ .",
                "If we remove this pair and instead match j with k we obtain a matching which excludes i, if the gain from trade on the new pair is taken according to the true valuation then we get ( ˆV −k )∗ − (ˆvj(i) − ci) + (vj(k) − ck) ≤ (V −i )∗ .",
                "Now, since the optimal allocation ˆT∗ matches j with k rather than with i we have that (V −i −j )∗ + (ˆvj(i) − ci) ≤ ˆV ∗ = ( ˆV −k −j )∗ + (ˆvj(k) − ck), where we have used that ( ˆV −i −j )∗ = (V −i −j )∗ since these allocations exclude j.",

                "The markets main objective is to produce an allocation of sellers goods to buyers as to maximize the total gain from trade.",
                "A commonly studied model of participant behavior is taken from the field of economic <br>mechanism design</br> [3, 4, 11].",
                "In this model each player has a private valuation function that assigns real values to each possible allocation.",
                "The algorithm motivates players to participate truthfully by handing payments to them.",
                "The mechanism in an exchange collects buyer bids and seller bids and clears the exchange by computing:(i) a set of trades, and (ii) the payments made and received by players.",
                "In designing a mechanism to compute trades and payments we must consider the bidding strategies of self-interested players, i.e. rational players that follow expected-utility maximizing strategies.",
                "We set allocative efficiency as our primary goal.",
                "That is the mechanism must compute a set of trades that maximizes gain from trade.",
                "In addition we require individual rationality (IR) so that all players have positive expected utility to participate, budget balance (BB) so that the exchange does not run at a loss, and incentive compatibility (IC) so that reporting the truth is a dominant strategy for each player.",
                "Unfortunately, Myerson and Satterthwaites (1983) well known result demonstrates that in bilateral trade it is impossible to simultaneously achieve perfect efficiency, BB, and IR using an IC mechanism [10].",

                "In effect a negotiation-range mechanism operates as a mediator between the market participants, offering them the grounds to be able to finalize the terms of the trade by themselves.",
                "This concept is natural to many real-world market environments such as the real estate market. 1 We focus on the single-unit heterogeneous setting: n sellers offer one unique good each by placing sealed bids specifying their willingness to sell, and m buyers, interested in buying a single good each, placing sealed bids specifying their willingness to pay for each good they may be interested in.",

                "It follows that in order to prove (8) we need to show ( ˆV −k )∗ + (V −i −j )∗ ≤ (V −i )∗ + ( ˆV −k −j )∗ + ˆvj(k) − vj(k). (9) Consider first the case were j is matched to i in ( ˆT−k )∗ .",
                "If we remove this pair and instead match j with k we obtain a matching which excludes i, if the gain from trade on the new pair is taken according to the true valuation then we get ( ˆV −k )∗ − (ˆvj(i) − ci) + (vj(k) − ck) ≤ (V −i )∗ .",
                "Now, since the optimal allocation ˆT∗ matches j with k rather than with i we have that (V −i −j )∗ + (ˆvj(i) − ci) ≤ ˆV ∗ = ( ˆV −k −j )∗ + (ˆvj(k) − ck), where we have used that ( ˆV −i −j )∗ = (V −i −j )∗ since these allocations exclude j.",

This ensures that edges in P may be colored by alternating colors 3 and 4 (starting with 3).",
                "Since S1 = i, we may use color 3 for the first edge and thus assign it to the allocation (T−i ) .",
