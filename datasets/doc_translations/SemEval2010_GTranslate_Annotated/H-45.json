Bruce Croft Department of Computer Science University of Massachusetts, Amherst {yzhou, croft}@cs.umass.edu ABSTRACT Current prediction techniques, which are generally designed for content-based queries and are typically evaluated on relatively homogenous test collections of small sizes, face serious challenges in web search environments where collections are significantly more heterogeneous and different types of retrieval tasks exist. In this paper, we present three techniques to address these challenges. We focus on performance prediction for two types of queries in web search environments: content-based and Named-Page finding. Our evaluation is mainly performed on the GOV2 collection. In addition to evaluating our models for the two types of queries separately, we consider a more challenging and realistic situation that the two types of queries are mixed together without prior information on query types. To assist prediction under the mixed-query situation, a novel query classifier is adopted. Results show that our prediction of web query performance is substantially more accurate than the current stateof-the-art prediction techniques. Consequently, our paper provides a practical approach to performance prediction in realworld web settings.

INTRODUCTION Query performance prediction has many applications in a variety of information retrieval (IR) areas such as improving retrieval consistency, query refinement, and distributed IR. The importance of this problem has been recognized by IR researchers and a number of new methods have been proposed for prediction recently [1, 2, 17]. Most work on prediction has focused on the traditional ad-hoc retrieval task where query performance is measured according to topical relevance. These prediction models are evaluated on TREC document collections which typically consist of no more than one million relatively homogenous newswire articles. With the popularity and influence of the Web, prediction techniques that will work well for web-style queries are highly preferable. However, web search environments pose significant challenges to current prediction models that are mainly designed for traditional TREC settings. Here we outline some of these challenges. First, web collections, which are much larger than conventional TREC collections, include a variety of documents that are different in many aspects such as quality and style. Current prediction techniques can be vulnerable to these characteristics of web collections. For example, the reported prediction accuracy of the ranking robustness technique and the clarity technique on the GOV2 collection (a large web collection) is significantly worse compared to the other TREC collections [1]. Similar prediction accuracy on the GOV2 collection using another technique is reported in [2], confirming the difficult of predicting query performance on a large web collection. Furthermore, web search goes beyond the scope of the ad-hoc retrieval task based on topical relevance. For example, the Named-Page (NP) finding task, which is a navigational task, is also popular in web retrieval. Query performance prediction for the NP task is still necessary since NP retrieval performance is far from perfect. In fact, according to the report on the NP task of the 2005 Terabyte Track [3], about 40% of the test queries perform poorly (no correct answer in the first 10 search results) even in the best run from the top group. To our knowledge, little research has explicitly addressed the problem of NP-query performance prediction. Current prediction models devised for content-based queries will be less effective for NP queries considering the fundamental differences between the two. Third, in real-world web search environments, user queries are usually a mixture of different types and prior knowledge about the type of each query is generally unavailable. The mixed-query situation raises new problems for query performance prediction. For instance, we may need to incorporate a query classifier into prediction models. Despite these problems, the ability to handle this situation is a crucial step towards turning query performance prediction from an interesting research topic into a practical tool for web retrieval. In this paper, we present three techniques to address the above challenges that current prediction models face in Web search environments. Our work focuses on query performance prediction for the content-based (ad-hoc) retrieval task and the name-page finding task in the context of web retrieval. Our first technique, called weighted information gain (WIG), makes use of both single term and term proximity features to estimate the quality of top retrieved documents for prediction. We find that WIG offers consistent prediction accuracy across various test collections and query types. Moreover, we demonstrate that good prediction accuracy can be achieved for the mixed-query situation by using WIG with the help of a query type classifier. Query feedback and first rank change, which are our second and third prediction techniques, perform well for content-based queries and NP queries respectively. Our main contributions include: (1) considerably improved prediction accuracy for web content-based queries over several state-of-the-art techniques. (2) new techniques for successfully predicting NP-query performance. (3) a practical and fully automatic solution to predicting mixed-query performance. In addition, one minor contribution is that we find that the robustness score [1], which was originally proposed for performance prediction, is helpful for query classification. 2. RELATED WORK As we mentioned in the introduction, a number of prediction techniques have been proposed recently that focus on contentbased queries in the topical relevance (ad-hoc) task. We know of no published work that addresses other types of queries such as NP queries, let alone a mixture of query types. Next we review some representative models. The major difficulty of performance prediction comes from the fact that many factors have an impact on retrieval performance. Each factor affects performance to a different degree and the overall effect is hard to predict accurately. Therefore, it is not surprising to notice that simple features, such as the frequency of query terms in the collection [4] and the average IDF of query terms [5], do not predict well. In fact, most of the successful techniques are based on measuring some characteristics of the retrieved document set to estimate topic difficulty. For example, the clarity score [6] measures the coherence of a list of documents by the KL-divergence between the query model and the collection model. The robustness score [1] quantifies another property of a ranked list: the robustness of the ranking in the presence of uncertainty. Carmel et al. [2] found that the distance measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the retrieved document set and the collection is significantly correlated to average precision. Vinay et al.[7] proposed four measures to capture the geometry of the top retrieved documents for prediction. The most effective measure is the sensitivity to document perturbation, an idea somewhat similar to the robustness score. Unfortunately, their way of measuring the sensitivity does not perform equally well for short queries and prediction accuracy drops considerably when a state-of-the-art retrieval technique (like Okapi or a language modeling approach) is adopted for retrieval instead of the tf-idf weighting used in their paper [16]. The difficulties of applying these models in web search environments have already been mentioned. In this paper, we mainly adopt the clarity score and the robustness score as our baselines. We experimentally show that the baselines, even after being carefully tuned, are inadequate for the web environment. One of our prediction models, WIG, is related to the Markov random field (MRF) model for information retrieval [8]. The MRF model directly models term dependence and is found be to highly effective across a variety of test collections (particularly web collections) and retrieval tasks. This model is used to estimate the joint probability distribution over documents and queries, an important part of WIG. The superiority of WIG over other prediction techniques based on unigram features, which will be demonstrated later in our paper, coincides with that of MRF for retrieval. In other word, it is interesting to note that term dependence, when being modeled appropriately, can be helpful for both improving and predicting retrieval performance. 3. PREDICTION MODELS 3.1 Weighted Information Gain (WIG) This section introduces a weighted information gain approach that incorporates both single term and proximity features for predicting performance for both content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries. Given a set of queries Q={Qs} (s=1,2,..N) which includes all possible user queries and a set of documents D={Dt} (t=1,2…M), we assume that each query-document pair (Qs,Dt) is manually judged and will be put in a relevance list if Qs is found to be relevant to Dt. The joint probability P(Qs,Dt) over queries Q and documents D denotes the probability that pair (Qs,Dt) will be in the relevance list. Such assumptions are similar to those used in [8]. Assuming that the user issues query Qi ∈Q and the retrieval results in response to Qi is a ranked list L of documents, we calculate the amount of information contained in P(Qs,Dt) with respect to Qi and L by Eq.1 which is a variant of entropy called the weighted entropy[13]. The weights in Eq.1 are solely determined by Qi and L. )1(),(log),(),( , , ∑−= ts tststsLQ DQPDQweightDQH i In this paper, we choose the weights as follows: LindocumentsKtopthecontainsLTwhere otherwise LTDandisifK DQweight K Kt ts )( )2( ,0 )(,/1 ),( ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ ∈= = The cutoff rank K is a parameter in our model that will be discussed later. Accordingly, Eq.1 can be simplified as follows: )3(),(log 1 ),( )( , ∑∈ −= LTD titsLQ Kt i DQP K DQH Unfortunately, weighted entropy ),(, tsLQ DQH i computed by Eq.3, which represents the amount of information about how likely the top ranked documents in L would be relevant to query Qi on average, cannot be compared across different queries, making it inappropriate for directly predicting query performance. To mitigate this problem, we come up with a background distribution P(Qs,C) over Q and D by imagining that every document in D is replaced by the same special document C which represents average language usage. In this paper, C is created by concatenating every document in D. Roughly speaking, C is the collection (the document set) {Dt} without document boundaries. Similarly, weighted entropy ),(, CQH sLQi calculated by Eq.3 represents the amount of information about how likely an average document (represented by the whole collection) would be relevant to query Qi. Now we introduce our performance predictor WIG which is the weighted information gain [13] computed as the difference between ),(, tsLQ DQH i and ),(, CQH sLQi .Specifically, given query Qi, collection C and ranked list L of documents, WIG is calculated as follows: )4( ),( ),( log 1 ),( ),( log),( ),(),(),,( )(, ,, ∑∑ ∈ == −= LTD i ti ts s ts ts tsLQsLQi Kt ii CQP DQP KCQP DQP DQweight DQHCQHLCQWIG WIG computed by Eq.4 measures the change in information about the quality of retrieval (in response to query Qi) from an imaginary state that only an average document is retrieved to a posterior state that the actual search results are observed. We hypothesize that WIG is positively correlated with retrieval effectiveness because high quality retrieval should be much more effective than just returning the average document. The heart of this technique is how to estimate the joint distribution P(Qs,Dt). In the language modeling approach to IR, a variety of models can be applied readily to estimate this distribution. Although most of these models are based on the bagof-words assumption, recent work on modeling term dependence under the language modeling framework have shown consistent and significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over bagof-words models. Inspired by the success of incorporating term proximity features into language models, we decide to adopt a good dependence model to estimate the probability P(Qs,Dt). The model we chose for this paper is Metzler and Crofts Markov Random Field (MRF) model, which has already demonstrated superiority over a number of collections and different retrieval tasks [8,9]. According to the MRF model, log P(Qi, Dt) can be written as )5()|(loglog),(log )( 1 ∑∈ +−= iQF tti DPZDQP ξ ξ ξλ where Z1 is a constant that ensures that P(Qi, Dt) sums up to 1. F(Qi) consists of a set of features expanded from the original query Qi . For example, assuming that query Qi is talented student program, F(Qi) includes features like program and talented student. We consider two kinds of features: single term features T and proximity features P. Proximity features include exact phrase (#1) and unordered window (#uwN) features as described in [8]. Note that F(Qi) is the union of T(Qi) and P(Qi). For more details on F(Qi) such as how to expand the original query Qi to F(Qi), we refer the reader to [8] and [9]. P(ξ|Dt) denotes the probability that feature ξ will occur in Dt. More details on P(ξ|Dt) will be provided later in this section. The choice of λξ is somewhat different from that used in [8] since λξ plays a dual role in our model. The first role, which is the same as in [8], is to weight between single term and proximity features. The other role, which is specific to our prediction task, is to normalize the size of F(Qi).We found that the following weight strategy for λξ satisfies the above two roles and generalizes well on a variety of collections and query types. )6( )(, |)(| 1 )(, |)(| ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎧ ∈ − ∈ = i i T i i T QP QP QT QT ξ λ ξ λ λξ where |T(Qi)| and |P(Qi)| denote the number of single term and proximity features in F(Qi) respectively. The reason for choosing the square root function in the denominator of λξ is to penalize a feature set of large size appropriately, making WIG more comparable across queries of various lengths. λT is a fixed parameter and set to 0.8 according to [8] throughout this paper. Similarly, log P(Qi,C) can be written as: )7()|(loglog),(log )( 2 ∑∈ +−= iQF i CPZCQP ξ ξ ξλ When constant Z1 and Z2 are dropped, WIG computed in Eq.4 can be rewritten as follows by plugging in Eq.5 and Eq.7 : )8( )|( )|( log 1 ),,( )( )( ∑ ∑∈ ∈ = LTD QF t i Kt i CP DP K LCQWIG ξ ξ ξ ξ λ One of the advantages of WIG over other techniques is that it can handle well both content-based and NP queries. Based on the type (or the predicted type) of Qi, the calculation of WIG in Eq. 8 differs in two aspects: (1) how to estimate P(ξ|Dt) and P(ξ|C), and (2) how to choose K. For content-based queries, P(ξ|C) is estimated by the relative frequency of feature ξ in collection C as a whole. The estimation of P(ξ|Dt) is the same as in [8]. Namely, we estimate P(ξ|Dt) by the relative frequency of feature ξ in Dt linearly smoothed with collection frequency P(ξ|C). K in Eq.8 is treated as a free parameter. Note that K is the only free parameter in the computation of WIG for content-based queries because all parameters involved in P(ξ|Dt) are assumed to be fixed by taking the suggested values in [8]. Regarding NP queries, we make use of document structure to estimate P(ξ|Dt) and P(ξ|C) by the so-called mixture of language models proposed in [10] and incorporated into the MRF model for Named-Page finding retrieval in [9]. The basic idea is that a document (collection) is divided into several fields such as the title field, the main-body field and the heading field. P(ξ|Dt) and P(ξ|C) are estimated by a linear combination of the language models from each field. Due to space constraints, we refer the reader to [9] for details. We adopt the exact same set of parameters as used in [9] for estimation. With regard to K in Eq.8, we set K to 1 because the Named-Page finding task heavily focuses on the first ranked document. Consequently, there are no free parameters in the computation of WIG for NP queries. 3.2 Query Feedback In this section, we introduce another technique called query feedback (QF) for prediction. Suppose that a user issues query Q to a retrieval system and a ranked list L of documents is returned. We view the retrieval system as a noisy channel. Specifically, we assume that the output of the channel is L and the input is Q. After going through the channel, Q becomes corrupted and is transformed to ranked list L. By thinking about the retrieval process this way, the problem of predicting retrieval effectiveness turns to the task of evaluating the quality of the channel. In other words, prediction becomes finding a way to measure the degree of corruption that arises when Q is transformed to L. As directly computing the degree of the corruption is difficult, we tackle this problem by approximation. Our main idea is that we measure to what extent information on Q can be recovered from L on the assumption that only L is observed. Specifically, we design a decoder that can accurately translate L back into new query Q and the similarity S between the original query Q and the new query Q is adopted as a performance predictor. This is a sketch of how the QF technique predicts query performance. Before filling in more details, we briefly discuss why this method would work. There is a relation between the similarity S defined above and retrieval performance. On the one hand, if the retrieval has strayed from the original sense of the query Q, the new query Q extracted from ranked list L in response to Q would be very different from the original query Q. On the other hand, a query distilled from a ranked list containing many relevant documents is likely to be similar to the original query. Further examples in support of the relation will be provided later. Next we detail how to build the decoder and how to measure the similarity S. In essence, the goal of the decoder is to compress ranked list L into a few informative terms that should represent the content of the top ranked documents in L. Our approach to this goal is to represent ranked list L by a language model (distribution over terms). Then terms are ranked by their contribution to the language models KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence from the background collection model. Top ranked terms will be chosen to form the new query Q. This approach is similar to that used in Section 4.1 of [11]. Specifically, we take three steps to compress ranked list L into query Q without referring to the original query. 1. We adopt the ranked list language model [14], to estimate a language model based on ranked list L. The model can be written as: )9()|()|()|( ∑∈ = LD LDPDwPLwP where w is any term, D is a document. P(D|L) is estimated by a linearly decreasing function of the rank of document D. 2. Each term in P(w|L) is ranked by the following KL-divergence contribution: )10( )|( )|( log)|( CwP LwP LwP where P(w|C) is the collection model estimated by the relative frequency of term w in collection C as a whole. 3. The top N ranked terms by Eq.10 form a weighted query Q={(wi,ti)} i=1,N. where wi denotes the i-th ranked term and weight ti is the KL-divergence contribution of wi in Eq. 10. Term cruise ship vessel sea passenger KL contribution 0.050 0.040 0.012 0.010 0.009 Table 1: top 5 terms compressed from the ranked list in response to query Cruise ship damage sea life Two representative examples, one for a poorly performing query Cruise ship damage sea life (TREC topic 719; average precision: 0.08) and the other for a high performing query prostate cancer treatments( TREC topic 710; average precision: 0.49), are shown in Table 1 and 2 respectively. These examples indicate how the similarity between the original and the new query correlates with retrieval performance. The parameter N in step 3 is set to 20 empirically and choosing a larger value of N is unnecessary since the weights after the top 20 are usually too small to make any difference. Term prostate cancer treatment men therapy KL contribution 0.177 0.140 0.028 0.025 0.020 Table 2: top 5 terms compressed from the ranked list in response to query prostate cancer treatments To measure the similarity between original query Q and new query Q, we first use Q to do retrieval on the same collection. A variant of the query likelihood model [15] is adopted for retrieval. Namely, documents are ranked by: )11()|()|( ),( ∑∈ = Qtw t i ii i DwPDQP where wi is a term in Q and ti is the associated weight. D is a document. Let L denote the new ranked list returned from the above retrieval. The similarity is measured by the overlap of documents in L and L. Specifically, the percentage of documents in the top K documents of L that are also present in the top K documents in L. the cutoff K is treated as a free parameter. We summarize here how the QF technique predicts performance given a query Q and the associated ranked list L. We first obtain a weighted query Q compressed from L by the above three steps. Then we use Q to perform retrieval and the new ranked list is L. The overlap of documents in L and L is used for prediction. 3.3 First Rank Change (FRC) In this section, we propose a method called the first rank change (FRC) for performance prediction for NP queries. This method is derived from the ranking robustness technique [1] that is mainly designed for content-based queries. When directly applied to NP queries, the robustness technique will be less effective because it takes the top ranked documents as a whole into account while NP queries usually have only one single relevant document. Instead, our technique focuses on the first rank document while the main idea of the robustness method remains. Specifically, the pseudocode for computing FRC is shown in figure 1. Input: (1) ranked list L={Di} where i=1,100. Di denotes the i-th ranked document. (2) query Q 1 initialize: (1) set the number of trials J=100000 (2) counter c=0; 2 for i=1 to J 3 Perturb every document in L, let the outcome be a set F={Di} where Di denotes the perturbed version of Di. 4 Do retrieval with query Q on set F 5 c=c+1 if and only if D1 is ranked first in step 4 6 end of for 7 return the ratio c/J Figure 1: pseudo-code for computing FRC FRC approximates the probability that the first ranked document in the original list L will remain ranked first even after the documents are perturbed. The higher the probability is, the more confidence we have in the first ranked document. On the other hand, in the extreme case of a random ranking, the probability would be as low as 0.5. We expect that FRC has a positive association with NP query performance. We adopt [1] to implement the document perturbation step (step 4 in Fig.1) using Poisson distributions. For more details, we refer the reader to [1]. 4. EVALUATION We now present the results of predicting query performance by our models. Three state-of-the-art techniques are adopted as our baselines. We evaluate our techniques across a variety of Web retrieval settings. As mentioned before, we consider two types of queries, that is, content-based (CB) queries and Named-Page(NP) finding queries. First, suppose that the query types are known. We investigate the correlation between the predicted retrieval performance and the actual performance for both types of queries separately. Results show that our methods yield considerable improvements over the baselines. We then consider a more challenging scenario where no prior information on query types is available. Two sub-cases are considered. In the first one, there exists only one type of query but the actual type is unknown. We assume a mixture of the two query types in the second case. We demonstrate that our models achieve good accuracy under this demanding scenario, making prediction practical in a real-world Web search environment. 4.1 Experimental Setup Our evaluation focuses on the GOV2 collection which contains about 25 million documents crawled from web sites in the .gov domain during 2004 [3]. We create two kinds of data set for CB queries and NP queries respectively. For the CB type, we use the ad-hoc topics of the Terabyte Tracks of 2004, 2005 and 2006 and name them TB04-adhoc, TB05-adhoc and TB06-adhoc respectively. In addition, we also use the ad-hoc topics of the 2004 Robust Track (RT04) to test the adaptability of our techniques to a non-Web environment. For NP queries, we use the Named-Page finding topics of the Terabyte Tracks of 2005 and 2006 and we name them TB05-NP and TB06-NP respectively. All queries used in our experiments are titles of TREC topics as we center on web retrieval. Table 3 summarizes the above data sets. Name Collection Topic Number Query Type TB04-adhoc GOV2 701-750 CB TB05-adhoc GOV2 751-800 CB TB06-adhoc GOV2 801-850 CB RT04 Disk 4+5 (minus CR) 301-450;601700 CB TB05-NP GOV2 NP601-NP872 NP TB06-NP GOV2 NP901-NP1081 NP Table 3: Summary of test collections and topics Retrieval performance of individual content-based and NP queries is measured by the average precision and reciprocal rank of the first correct answer respectively. We make use of the Markov Random field model for both ad-hoc and Named-Page finding retrieval. We adopt the same setting of retrieval parameters used in [8,9]. The Indri search engine [12] is used for all of our experiments. Though not reported here, we also tried the query likelihood model for ad-hoc retrieval and found that the results change little because of the very high correlation between the query performances obtained by the two retrieval models (0.96 measured by Pearsons coefficient). 4.2 Known Query Types Suppose that query types are known. We treat each type of query separately and measure the correlation with average precision (or the reciprocal rank in the case of NP queries). We adopt the Pearsons correlation test which reflects the degree of linear relationship between the predicted and the actual retrieval performance. 4.2.1 Content-based Queries Methods Clarity Robust JSD WIG QF WIG +QF TB04+0 5 adhoc 0.333 0.317 0.362 0.574 0.480 0.637 TB06 adhoc 0.076 0.294 N/A 0.464 0.422 0.511 Table 4: Pearsons correlation coefficients for correlation with average precision on the Terabyte Tracks (ad-hoc) for clarity score, robustness score, the JSD-based method(we directly cites the score reported in [2]), WIG, query feedback(QF) and a linear combination of WIG and QF. Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. Table 4 shows the correlation with average precision on two data sets: one is a combination of TB04-adhoc and TB05-adhoc(100 topics in total) and the other is TB06-adhoc (50 topics). The reason that we put TB04-adhoc and TB05-adhoc together is to make our results comparable to [2]. Our baselines are the clarity score (clarity) [6],the robustness score (robust)[1] and the JSDbased method (JSD) [2]. For the clarity and robustness score, we have tried different parameter settings and report the highest correlation coefficients we have found. We directly cite the result of the JSD-based method reported in [2]. The table also shows the results for the Weighted Information Gain (WIG) method and the Query Feedback (QF) method for predicting content-based queries. As we described in the previous section, both WIG and QF have one free parameter to set, that is, the cutoff rank K. We train the parameter on one dataset and test on the other. When combining WIG and QF, a simple linear combination is used and the combination weight is learned from the training data set. From these results, we can see that our methods are considerably more accurate compared to the baselines. We also observe that further improvements are obtained from the combination of WIG and QF, suggesting that they measure different properties of the retrieval process that relate to performance. We discover that our methods generalize well on TB06-adhoc while the correlation for the clarity score with retrieval performance on this data set is considerably worse. Further investigation shows that the mean average precision of TB06-adhoc is 0.342 and is about 10% better than that of the first data set. While the other three methods typically consider the top 100 or less documents given a ranked list, the clarity method usually needs the top 500 or more documents to adequately measure the coherence of a ranked list. Higher mean average precision makes ranked lists retrieved by different queries more similar in terms of coherence at the level of top 500 documents. We believe that this is the main reason for the low accuracy of the clarity score on the second data set. Though this paper focuses on a Web search environment, it is desirable that our techniques will work consistently well in other situations. To this end, we examine the effectiveness of our techniques on the Robust 2004 Track. For our methods, we evenly divide all of the test queries into five groups and perform five-fold cross validation. Each time we use one group for training and the remaining four groups for testing. We make use of all of the queries for our two baselines, that is, the clarity score and the robustness score. The parameters for our baselines are the same as those used in [1].The results shown in Table 5 demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of our methods is on a par with that of the two strong baselines. Clarity Robust WIG QF 0.464 0.539 0.468 0.464 Table 5: Comparison of Pearsons correlation coefficients on the 2004 Robust Track for clarity score, robustness score, WIG and query feedback (QF). Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. Furthermore, we examine the prediction sensitivity of our methods to the cutoff rank K. With respect to WIG, it is quite robust to K on the Terabyte Tracks (2004-2006) while it prefers a small value of K like 5 on the 2004 Robust Track. In other words, a small value of K is a nearly-optimal choice for both kinds of tracks. Considering the fact that all other parameters involved in WIG are fixed and consequently the same for the two cases, this means WIG can achieve nearly-optimal prediction accuracy in two considerably different situations with exactly the same parameter setting. Regarding QF, it prefers a larger value of K such as 100 on the Terabyte Tracks and a smaller value of K such as 25 on the 2004 Robust Track. 4.2.2 NP Queries We adopt WIG and first rank change (FRC) for predicting NPquery performance. We also try a linear combination of the two as in the previous section. The combination weight is obtained from the other data set. We use the correlation with the reciprocal ranks measured by the Pearsons correlation test to evaluate prediction quality. The results are presented in Table 6. Again, our baselines are the clarity score and the robustness score. To make a fair comparison, we tune the clarity score in different ways. We found that using the first ranked document to build the query model yields the best prediction accuracy. We also attempted to utilize document structure by using the mixture of language models mentioned in section 3.1. Little improvement was obtained. The correlation coefficients for the clarity score reported in Table 6 are the best we have found. As we can see, our methods considerably outperform the clarity score technique on both of the runs. This confirms our intuition that the use of a coherence-based measure like the clarity score is inappropriate for NP queries. Methods Clarity Robust. WIG FRC WIG+FRC TB05-NP 0.150 -0.370 0.458 0.440 0.525 TB06-NP 0.112 -0.160 0.478 0.386 0.515 Table 6: Pearsons correlation coefficients for correlation with reciprocal ranks on the Terabyte Tracks (NP) for clarity score, robustness score, WIG, the first rank change (FRC) and a linear combination of WIG and FRC. Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. Regarding the robustness score, we also tune the parameters and report the best we have found. We observe an interesting and surprising negative correlation with reciprocal ranks. We explain this finding briefly. A high robustness score means that a number of top ranked documents in the original ranked list are still highly ranked after perturbing the documents. The existence of such documents is a good sign of high performance for content-based queries as these queries usually contain a number of relevant documents [1]. However, with regard to NP queries, one fundamental difference is that there is only one relevant document for each query. The existence of such documents can confuse the ranking function and lead to low retrieval performance. Although the negative correlation with retrieval performance exists, the strength of the correlation is weaker and less consistent compared to our methods as shown in Table 6. Based on the above analysis, we can see that current prediction techniques like clarity score and robustness score that are mainly designed for content-based queries face significant challenges and are inadequate to deal with NP queries. Our two techniques proposed for NP queries consistently demonstrate good prediction accuracy, displaying initial success in solving the problem of predicting performance for NP queries. Another point we want to stress is that the WIG method works well for both types of queries, a desirable property that most prediction techniques lack. 4.3 Unknown Query Types In this section, we run two kinds of experiments without access to query type labels. First, we assume that only one type of query exists but the type is unknown. Second, we experiment on a mixture of content-based and NP queries. The following two subsections will report results for the two conditions respectively. 4.3.1 Only One Type exists We assume that all queries are of the same type, that is, they are either NP queries or content-based queries. We choose WIG to deal with this case because it shows good prediction accuracy for both types of queries in the previous section. We consider two cases: (1) CB: all 150 title queries from the ad-hoc task of the Terabyte Tracks 2004-2006 (2)NP: all 433 NP queries from the named page finding task of the Terabyte Tracks 2005 and 2006. We take a simple strategy by labeling all of the queries in each case as the same type (either NP or CB) regardless of their actual type. The computation of WIG will be based on the labeled query type instead of the actual type. There are four possibilities with respect to the relation between the actual type and the labeled type. The correlation with retrieval performance under the four possibilities is presented in Table 7. For example, the value 0.445 at the intersection between the second row and the third column shows the Pearsons correlation coefficient for correlation with average precision when the content-based queries are incorrectly labeled as the NP type. Based on these results, we recommend treating all queries as the NP type when only one query type exists and accurate query classification is not feasible, considering the risk that a large loss of accuracy will occur if NP queries are incorrectly labeled as content-based queries. These results also demonstrate the strong adaptability of WIG to different query types. CB (labeled) NP (labeled) CB (actual) 0.536 0.445 NP (actual) 0.174 0.467 Table 7: Comparison of Pearsons correlation coefficients for correlation with retrieval performance under four possibilities on the Terabyte Tracks (NP). Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet. We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types). This is a challenging task because both the predicted and actual performance for one type of query can be incomparable to that for the other type. Next we discuss how to implement our evaluation. We create a query pool which consists of all of the 150 ad-hoc title queries from Terabyte Track 2004-2006 and all of the 433 NP queries from Terabyte Track 2005&2006. We divide the queries in the pool into classes: good (better than 50% of the queries of the same type in terms of retrieval performance) and bad (otherwise). According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a content-based query with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good. Then, each time we randomly select one query Q from the pool with probability p that Q is contented-based. The remaining queries are used as training data. We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier. Namely, the query classifier tells us whether query Q is NP or content-based. Based on the predicted query type and the score computed for query Q by a prediction technique, a binary decision is made about whether query Q is good or bad by comparing to the score threshold of the predicted query type obtained from the training data. Prediction accuracy is measured by the accuracy of the binary decision. In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad). It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy. Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process. Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data. When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold. Similar procedures will be taken for other prediction techniques. Now we briefly introduce the automatic query type classifier used in this paper. We find that the robustness score, though originally proposed for performance prediction, is a good indicator of query types. We find that on average content-based queries have a much higher robustness score than NP queries. For example, Figure 2 shows the distributions of robustness scores for NP and content-based queries. According to this finding, the robustness score classifier will attach a NP (CB) label to the query if the robustness score for the query is below (above) a threshold trained from the training data. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 -1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 NP Content-based Figure 2: Distribution of robustness scores for NP and CB queries. The NP queries are the 252 NP topics from the 2005 Terabyte Track. The content-based queries are the 150 ad-hoc title from the Terabyte Tracks 2004-2006. The probability distributions are estimated by the Kernel density estimation method. Strategies Robust WIG-1 WIG-2 WIG-3 Optimal p=0.6 0.565 0.624 0.665 0.684 0.701 P=0.4 0.567 0.633 0.654 0.673 0.696 Table 8: Comparison of prediction accuracy for five strategies in the mixed-query situation. Two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is content-based with the probability p=0.6. (that is, the query is NP with probability 0.4 ) (2) set the probability p=0.4. We consider five strategies in our experiments. In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB). This strategy represents the level of prediction accuracy that current prediction techniques can achieve in an ideal condition that query types are known. In the next following three strategies, the WIG method is adopted for performance prediction. The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one. These three strategies are denoted by WIG-1, WIG-2 and WIG-3 respectively. The reason we are interested in WIG-1 is based on the results from section 4.3.1. In the last strategy (denoted by Optimal) which serves as an upper bound on how well we can do so far, we fully make use of our prediction techniques for each query type assuming a perfect query classifier is available. Specifically, we linearly combine WIG and QF for content-based queries and WIG and FRC for NP queries. The results for the five strategies are shown in Table 8. For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4. From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed. Some further improvements over WIG-3 are observed when combined with other prediction techniques. The merit of WIG-2 is that it provides a practical solution to automatically identifying poorly performing queries in a Web search environment with mixed query types, which poses considerable obstacles to traditional prediction techniques. 5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments. We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios. In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively. For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available. We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation. Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine. Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency. Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index. On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents. How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work. In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques. For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation. Guided by performance prediction, we can make a better decision on when to or how to modify queries to enhance retrieval effectiveness. We would like to carry out research in this direction in the future. 6.

Bruce Croft Departamento de Informática de la Universidad de Massachusetts, Amherst {Yzhou, Crofthth}@cs.umass.edu Técnicas de predicción actuales abstractas, que generalmente están diseñadas para consultas basadas en contenidoTípicamente evaluadas en colecciones de pruebas relativamente homogéneas de tamaños pequeños, enfrentan serios desafíos en entornos de búsqueda web donde las colecciones son significativamente más heterogéneas y existen diferentes tipos de tareas de recuperación. En este artículo, presentamos tres técnicas para abordar estos desafíos. Nos centramos en la predicción de rendimiento para dos tipos de consultas en entornos de búsqueda web: hallazgo basado en contenido y nombrado PAGE. Nuestra evaluación se realiza principalmente en la colección Gov2. Además de evaluar nuestros modelos para los dos tipos de consultas por separado, consideramos una situación más desafiante y realista de que los dos tipos de consultas se mezclan sin información previa sobre los tipos de consultas. Para ayudar a la predicción bajo la situación de la Quera mixta, se adopta un clasificador de consultas novedoso. Los resultados muestran que nuestra predicción del rendimiento de la consulta web es sustancialmente más precisa que las técnicas actuales de predicción de estado de arte. En consecuencia, nuestro documento proporciona un enfoque práctico para la predicción del rendimiento en la configuración web de RealWorld. Categorías y descriptores de temas H.3.3 [Algorización y recuperación de almacenamiento de información]: Búsqueda y recuperación de información -Formulación de la Quera Algoritmos generales, experimentación, teoría 1. La predicción del rendimiento de la consulta de introducción tiene muchas aplicaciones en una variedad de áreas de recuperación de información (IR), como mejorar la consistencia de recuperación, el refinamiento de la consulta y el IR distribuido. La importancia de este problema ha sido reconocida por los investigadores IR y recientemente se han propuesto varios métodos nuevos para su predicción [1, 2, 17]. La mayoría del trabajo en predicción se ha centrado en la tarea tradicional de recuperación ad-hoc donde el rendimiento de la consulta se mide de acuerdo con la relevancia tópica. Estos modelos de predicción se evalúan en colecciones de documentos TREC que generalmente consisten en no más de un millón de artículos relativamente homogéneos de Newswire. Con la popularidad y la influencia de la Web, las técnicas de predicción que funcionarán bien para consultas de estilo Web son muy preferibles. Sin embargo, los entornos de búsqueda web plantean desafíos significativos para los modelos de predicción actuales que están diseñados principalmente para la configuración tradicional de TREC. Aquí describimos algunos de estos desafíos. Primero, las colecciones web, que son mucho más grandes que las colecciones TREC convencionales, incluyen una variedad de documentos que son diferentes en muchos aspectos, como la calidad y el estilo. Las técnicas de predicción actuales pueden ser vulnerables a estas características de las colecciones web. Por ejemplo, la precisión de predicción informada de la técnica de robustez de clasificación y la técnica de claridad en la colección Gov2 (una gran colección web) es significativamente peor en comparación con las otras colecciones TREC [1]. Se informa una precisión de predicción similar en la colección Gov2 utilizando otra técnica en [2], lo que confirma lo difícil de predecir el rendimiento de la consulta en una gran colección web. Además, la búsqueda web va más allá del alcance de la tarea de recuperación ad-hoc basada en la relevancia tópica. Por ejemplo, la tarea de búsqueda de la página nombrada (NP), que es una tarea de navegación, también es popular en la recuperación web. La predicción del rendimiento de la consulta para la tarea NP todavía es necesaria ya que el rendimiento de recuperación de NP está lejos de ser perfecto. De hecho, según el informe sobre la tarea NP de la pista de Terabyte 2005 [3], alrededor del 40% de las consultas de prueba funcionan mal (sin respuesta correcta en los primeros 10 resultados de búsqueda) incluso en la mejor ejecución del grupo superior. Hasta donde sabemos, poca investigación ha abordado explícitamente el problema de la predicción del rendimiento de NP Query. Los modelos de predicción actuales diseñados para consultas basadas en el contenido serán menos efectivos para las consultas NP considerando las diferencias fundamentales entre los dos. En tercer lugar, en los entornos de búsqueda web del mundo real, las consultas de los usuarios suelen ser una mezcla de diferentes tipos y el conocimiento previo sobre el tipo de cada consulta generalmente no está disponible. La situación de la cuarta mixta plantea nuevos problemas para la predicción del rendimiento de la consulta. Por ejemplo, es posible que necesitemos incorporar un clasificador de consulta en los modelos de predicción. A pesar de estos problemas, la capacidad de manejar esta situación es un paso crucial para convertir la predicción del rendimiento de la consulta de un tema de investigación interesante en una herramienta práctica para la recuperación web. En este documento, presentamos tres técnicas para abordar los desafíos anteriores que enfrentan los modelos de predicción actuales en los entornos de búsqueda web. Nuestro trabajo se centra en la predicción del rendimiento de la consulta para la tarea de recuperación basada en contenido (AD-Hoc) y la tarea de búsqueda de nombre de nombre en el contexto de la recuperación web. Nuestra primera técnica, llamada ganancia de información ponderada (WIG), hace uso de las características de proximidad de un solo término y término para estimar la calidad de los documentos recuperados para la predicción. Encontramos que WIG ofrece una precisión de predicción consistente en varias colecciones de pruebas y tipos de consultas. Además, demostramos que se puede lograr una buena precisión de la predicción para la situación de Quera mixta mediante el uso de WIG con la ayuda de un clasificador de tipo de consulta. La retroalimentación de consulta y el cambio de primer rango, que son nuestras técnicas de predicción segunda y tercera, funcionan bien para consultas basadas en contenido y consultas NP, respectivamente. Nuestras principales contribuciones incluyen: (1) una precisión de predicción considerablemente mejorada para consultas basadas en el contenido web sobre varias técnicas de última generación.(2) Nuevas técnicas para predecir con éxito el rendimiento de NP-Query.(3) Una solución práctica y totalmente automática para predecir el rendimiento mixto de la cuarta. Además, una contribución menor es que encontramos que el puntaje de robustez [1], que se propuso originalmente para la predicción del rendimiento, es útil para la clasificación de consultas.2. Trabajo relacionado Como mencionamos en la introducción, se han propuesto una serie de técnicas de predicción recientemente que se centran en consultas basadas en el contenido en la tarea de relevancia tópica (AD-HOC). No sabemos de ningún trabajo publicado que aborde otros tipos de consultas, como consultas NP, y mucho menos una mezcla de tipos de consultas. A continuación, revisamos algunos modelos representativos. La principal dificultad de la predicción del rendimiento proviene del hecho de que muchos factores tienen un impacto en el rendimiento de la recuperación. Cada factor afecta el rendimiento en un grado diferente y el efecto general es difícil de predecir con precisión. Por lo tanto, no es sorprendente notar que las características simples, como la frecuencia de los términos de consulta en la colección [4] y las IDF promedio de los términos de consulta [5], no predicen bien. De hecho, la mayoría de las técnicas exitosas se basan en medir algunas características del documento recuperado establecido para estimar la dificultad del tema. Por ejemplo, la puntuación de claridad [6] mide la coherencia de una lista de documentos por parte de la divergencia KL entre el modelo de consulta y el modelo de recolección. El puntaje de robustez [1] cuantifica otra propiedad de una lista clasificada: la robustez de la clasificación en presencia de incertidumbre. Carmel et al.[2] encontraron que la distancia medida por la divergencia de Jensen-Shannon entre el conjunto de documentos recuperado y la colección se correlaciona significativamente con la precisión promedio. Vinay et al.[7] propuso cuatro medidas para capturar la geometría de los documentos superiores recuperados para la predicción. La medida más efectiva es la sensibilidad a la perturbación del documento, una idea algo similar a la puntuación de robustez. Desafortunadamente, su forma de medir la sensibilidad no funciona igualmente bien para consultas cortas y la precisión de la predicción cae considerablemente cuando se adopta una técnica de recuperación de última generación (como Okapi o un enfoque de modelado de idiomas) para recuperar en lugar de TF-Ponderación de las FDI utilizadas en su papel [16]. Ya se han mencionado las dificultades de aplicar estos modelos en entornos de búsqueda web. En este artículo, adoptamos principalmente el puntaje de claridad y el puntaje de robustez como líneas de base. Mostramos experimentalmente que las líneas de base, incluso después de ser cuidadosamente ajustadas, son inadecuadas para el entorno web. Uno de nuestros modelos de predicción, WIG, está relacionado con el modelo de campo aleatorio de Markov (MRF) para la recuperación de información [8]. El modelo MRF modela directamente la dependencia del término y se encuentra muy efectivo en una variedad de colecciones de pruebas (particularmente colecciones web) y tareas de recuperación. Este modelo se utiliza para estimar la distribución de probabilidad conjunta sobre documentos y consultas, una parte importante de la peluca. La superioridad de la peluca sobre otras técnicas de predicción basadas en características unigram, que se demostrarán más adelante en nuestro artículo, coincide con la de MRF para la recuperación. En otra palabra, es interesante observar que la dependencia del término, cuando se modela adecuadamente, puede ser útil para mejorar y predecir el rendimiento de la recuperación.3. Modelos de predicción 3.1 Ganancia de información ponderada (WIG) Esta sección introduce un enfoque de ganancia de información ponderado que incorpora características de un solo término y proximidad para predecir el rendimiento de las consultas de búsqueda de PAGE basadas en contenido y nombradas (NP). Dado un conjunto de consultas q = {qs} (s = 1,2, .. n) que incluye todas las consultas de usuarios posibles y un conjunto de documentos d = {dt} (t = 1,2 ... m), asumimos queCada par de documentos de consulta (QS, DT) se juzga manualmente y se pondrá en una lista de relevancia si se encuentra que QS es relevante para DT. La probabilidad conjunta P (QS, DT) sobre consultas Q y los documentos d denota la probabilidad de que el par (QS, DT) estará en la lista de relevancia. Tales supuestos son similares a los utilizados en [8]. Suponiendo que el usuario emite consultas Qi ∈Q y la recuperación de los resultados en respuesta a Qi es una lista clasificada L de documentos, calculamos la cantidad de información contenida en P (QS, DT) con respecto a Qi y L por Eq.1es una variante de entropía llamada entropía ponderada [13]. Los pesos en Eq.1 están determinados únicamente por Qi y L.) 1 (), (log), (), (,, ∑− = TS TStStSlq DQPDQWeightDQH I En este documento, elegimos los pesos de la siguiente manera: LindocumentskTopTontainsltTtwherDqweight k kt ts) () 2 (, 0) (,/1), (⎩ ⎨ ⎧ ∈ = = El rango de corte K es un parámetro en nuestro modelo que se discutirá más adelante. En consecuencia, la Eq.1 se puede simplificar de la siguiente manera :) 3 (), (log 1), () (, ∑∈ - = Ltd titslq kt i dqp k dqh Desafortunadamente, entropía ponderada), (, tslq dqh I calculado por eq.3, que representa la cantidad de información sobre la probabilidad de que los documentos clasificados en L sean relevantes para la consulta Qi en promedio, no se puede comparar en diferentes consultas, lo que lo hace inapropiado para predecir directamente el rendimiento de la consulta. Para mitigar este problema, presentamos una distribución de fondo P (QS, C) sobre Q y D imaginando que cada documento en D es reemplazado por el mismo documento especial C que representa el uso promedio del idioma. En este documento, C se crea concatenando cada documento en D. En términos generales, C es la colección (el conjunto de documentos) {DT} sin límites de documento. Del mismo modo, la entropía ponderada), (, CQH SLQI calculado por Eq.3 representa la cantidad de información sobre cómo es probable que un documento promedio (representado por toda la colección) sea relevante para la consulta Qi. Ahora presentamos nuestra peluca predictor de rendimiento, que es la ganancia de información ponderada [13] calculada como la diferencia entre), (, TSLQ DQH I y), (, CQH SLQI. Específicamente, Consulta dada Qi, Colección C y Lista de clasificación L de documentos de documentos, La peluca se calcula de la siguiente manera: 4 (), (), (log 1), (), (log), (), (), () ,, () (, ,, ∑∑ ∈ == - =Ltd i ti ts s ts ts tslqslqi Kt II CQP DQP KCQP DQP DQPeight DQHCQHLCQWIG COMPLETADO BY EQ.4 Mide el cambio de información sobre la calidad de la recuperación (en respuesta a la consulta Qi) de un estado imaginario de que solo un documento promedio está recuperado está recuperadoa un estado posterior que se observan los resultados de búsqueda reales. Presumimos que la peluca se correlaciona positivamente con la efectividad de la recuperación porque la recuperación de alta calidad debería ser mucho más efectiva que simplemente devolver el documento promedio. El corazón de esta técnica es cómo estimar la distribución conjunta P (QS, DT). En el enfoque de modelado de idiomas para IR, se puede aplicar una variedad de modelos fácilmente para estimar esta distribución. Aunque la mayoría de estos modelos se basan en la suposición de palabras BagOf, el trabajo reciente sobre la dependencia del término de modelado bajo el marco de modelado de idiomas ha mostrado mejoras consistentes y significativas en la efectividad de la recuperación sobre los modelos de palabras de las palabras. Inspirados en el éxito de incorporar características de proximidad de término en modelos de lenguaje, decidimos adoptar un modelo de buena dependencia para estimar la probabilidad P (QS, DT). El modelo que elegimos para este documento es el modelo de campo aleatorio de Metzler y Crofts Markov (MRF), que ya ha demostrado superioridad en varias colecciones y diferentes tareas de recuperación [8,9]. Según el modelo MRF, log P (Qi, DT) se puede escribir como) 5 () | (loglog), (log) (1 ∑∈ + - = Iqf tti dpzdqp ξ ξ ξλ donde z1 es una constante que asegura que garanticeP (Qi, DT) suma hasta 1. F (Qi) consiste en un conjunto de características expandidas de la consulta original Qi. Por ejemplo, suponiendo que la consulta Qi sea un programa talentoso de estudiantes, F (Qi) incluye características como el programa y el talentoso estudiante. Consideramos dos tipos de características: características de un solo término T y características de proximidad P. Las características de proximidad incluyen frase exacta (#1) y características de ventana desordenada (#UWN) como se describe en [8]. Tenga en cuenta que F (Qi) es la unión de T (Qi) y P (Qi). Para obtener más detalles sobre F (Qi) como cómo expandir la consulta original Qi a F (Qi), remitimos al lector a [8] y [9]. P (ξ | dt) denota la probabilidad de que la característica ξ ocurra en DT. Más adelante se proporcionarán más detalles sobre P (ξ | DT) más adelante en esta sección. La elección de λξ es algo diferente de la utilizada en [8] ya que λξ juega un papel doble en nuestro modelo. El primer rol, que es el mismo que en [8], es peso entre las características de un solo término y la proximidad. El otro rol, que es específico de nuestra tarea de predicción, es normalizar el tamaño de F (Qi). Encontramos que la siguiente estrategia de peso para λξ satisface los dos roles anteriores y se generaliza bien en una variedad de colecciones y tipos de consultas.) 6 () (, |) (| 1) (, |) (| ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎧ ∈ - ∈ = I T I I T QP QP QT QT ξ λ ξ λ λξ donde | t (qi) || P (Qi) | denota el número de características de un solo término y proximidad en F (Qi) respectivamente. La razón para elegir la función de la raíz cuadrada en el denominador de λξ es penalizar un conjunto de características de gran tamaño adecuadamente, lo que hace que la peluca sea más comparable entre consultas de varias longitudes.λt es un parámetro fijo y establecido en 0.8 según [8] a lo largo de este documento. Del mismo modo, el log p (qi, c) se puede escribir como :) 7 () | (loglog), (log) (2 ∑∈ + - = Iqf i cpzcqp ξ ξ ξλ cuando se caen constantes Z1 y Z2, WIG calculadoEq.4 se puede reescribir de la siguiente manera conectando en Eq.5 y Eq.7:) 8 () | () | (log 1) ,, () () (∑ ∑∈ ∈ ∈ = Ltd qf t i kt i cp dpK lcqwig ξ ξ ξ ξ λ Una de las ventajas de la peluca sobre otras técnicas es que puede manejar bien las consultas basadas en el contenido y NP. Basado en el tipo (o el tipo predicho) de Qi, el cálculo de la peluca en la ecuación.8 difiere en dos aspectos: (1) cómo estimar P (ξ | dt) y p (ξ | c), y (2) cómo elegir K. para consultas basadas en contenido, P (ξ | c) se estima porLa frecuencia relativa de la característica ξ en la colección c en su conjunto. La estimación de p (ξ | dt) es la misma que en [8]. A saber, estimamos P (ξ | dt) por la frecuencia relativa de la característica ξ en DT suavizado linealmente con frecuencia de recolección P (ξ | c). K en Eq.8 se trata como un parámetro libre. Tenga en cuenta que K es el único parámetro libre en el cálculo de WIG para consultas basadas en el contenido porque se supone que todos los parámetros involucrados en P (ξ | DT) se fijan tomando los valores sugeridos en [8]. Con respecto a las consultas NP, utilizamos la estructura de documentos para estimar p (ξ | dt) y p (ξ | c) por la llamada mezcla de modelos de lenguaje propuestos en [10] e incorporados en el modelo MRF para la búsqueda de páginas nombradasRecuperación en [9]. La idea básica es que un documento (colección) se divide en varios campos, como el campo de título, el campo del cuerpo principal y el campo de encabezado. P (ξ | dt) y P (ξ | c) se estiman mediante una combinación lineal de los modelos de lenguaje de cada campo. Debido a las limitaciones de espacio, remitimos al lector a [9] para obtener más detalles. Adoptamos exactamente el mismo conjunto de parámetros que se usan en [9] para la estimación. Con respecto a K en la Eq.8, establecemos K en 1 porque la tarea de búsqueda de páginas nombradas se centra en gran medida en el primer documento clasificado. En consecuencia, no hay parámetros libres en el cálculo de WIG para consultas NP.3.2 Comentarios de consulta En esta sección, presentamos otra técnica llamada retroalimentación de consultas (QF) para la predicción. Supongamos que un usuario emite una consulta Q a un sistema de recuperación y se devuelve una lista clasificada L de documentos. Vemos el sistema de recuperación como un canal ruidoso. Específicamente, suponemos que la salida del canal es L y la entrada es Q. Después de pasar por el canal, Q se corrompe y se transforma en la lista clasificada L. Al pensar en el proceso de recuperación de esta manera, el problema de predecir la efectividad de la recuperación se convierte en la tarea de evaluar la calidad del canal. En otras palabras, la predicción se convierte en una manera de medir el grado de corrupción que surge cuando Q se transforma en L. ya que calcular directamente el grado de corrupción es difícil, abordamos este problema con aproximación. Nuestra idea principal es que medimos en qué medida la información sobre Q se puede recuperar de L en el supuesto de que solo se observa L. Específicamente, diseñamos un decodificador que puede traducir con precisión L en una nueva consulta Q y la similitud entre la consulta original Q y la nueva consulta Q se adopta como un predictor de rendimiento. Este es un boceto de cómo la técnica QF predice el rendimiento de la consulta. Antes de completar más detalles, discutimos brevemente por qué funcionaría este método. Existe una relación entre la similitud definida anteriormente y el rendimiento de recuperación. Por un lado, si la recuperación se ha alejado del sentido original de la consulta Q, la nueva consulta Q extraída de la lista clasificada L en respuesta a Q sería muy diferente de la consulta original Q. Por otro lado, una consulta destilada de una lista clasificada que contiene muchos documentos relevantes es probable que sea similar a la consulta original. Más ejemplos en apoyo de la relación se proporcionarán más adelante. A continuación, detallamos cómo construir el decodificador y cómo medir la similitud S. En esencia, el objetivo del decodificador es comprimir la lista L de la lista L en algunos términos informativos que deberían representar el contenido de los documentos clasificados en L. Nuestro enfoqueA este objetivo es representar la Lista L clasificada por un modelo de idioma (distribución sobre términos). Luego, los términos se clasifican por su contribución a los modelos de idiomas KL (Kullback-Leiber) Divergencia del modelo de recolección de fondo. Se eligirán los términos clasificados para formar la nueva consulta Q. Este enfoque es similar al utilizado en la Sección 4.1 de [11]. Específicamente, tomamos tres pasos para comprimir la Lista L en la consulta Q sin referirnos a la consulta original.1. Adoptamos el modelo de lenguaje de lista clasificado [14], para estimar un modelo de idioma basado en la lista clasificada L. El modelo se puede escribir como :) 9 () | () | () | (∑∈ = ld ldpdwplwp donde w es cualquiera es cualquierTérmino, D es un documento.

Estos ejemplos indican cómo la similitud entre el original y la nueva consulta se correlaciona con el rendimiento de la recuperación. El parámetro n en el paso 3 se establece en 20 empíricamente y elegir un valor mayor de n es innecesario ya que los pesos después de los 20 top generalmente son demasiado pequeños para marcar cualquier diferencia.

Se adopta una variante del modelo de probabilidad de consulta [15] para la recuperación. A saber, los documentos se clasifican con :) 11 () | () | (), (∑∈ = Qtw T I II I DWPDQP donde wi es un término en q y ti es el peso asociado. D es un documento. Deje que L denote la nueva lista clasificada devuelta de la recuperación anterior. La similitud se mide mediante la superposición de documentos en L y L. Específicamente, el porcentaje de documentos en los principales documentos K de L que también están presentes en los documentos K superiores en L. El corte K se trata como un parámetro libre. Resumimos aquí cómo la técnica QF predice el rendimiento dada una consulta Q y la lista clasificada asociada L. Primero obtenemos una consulta Q ponderada comprimida de L en los tres pasos anteriores. Luego usamos Q para realizar la recuperación y la nueva lista clasificada es L. La superposición de documentos en L y L se usa para la predicción.3.3 Cambio de primer rango (FRC) En esta sección, proponemos un método llamado Cambio de primer rango (FRC) para la predicción de rendimiento para consultas NP. Este método se deriva de la técnica de robustez de clasificación [1] que está diseñada principalmente para consultas basadas en contenido. Cuando se aplica directamente a las consultas NP, la técnica de robustez será menos efectiva porque tiene en cuenta los documentos mejor clasificados, mientras que las consultas NP generalmente tienen un solo documento relevante. En cambio, nuestra técnica se centra en el documento de primer rango, mientras que la idea principal del método de robustez permanece. Específicamente, el pseudocódigo para calcular FRC se muestra en la Figura 1. Entrada: (1) Lista clasificada l = {di} donde i = 1,100. DI denota el documento clasificado I-Th.(2) Consulta Q 1 Inicializar: (1) Establezca el número de pruebas J = 100000 (2) contador C = 0;2 para i = 1 a j 3 perturban cada documento en L, deje que el resultado sea un conjunto F = {di} donde DI denota la versión perturbada de Di.4 Do Recuperación con consulta Q en el conjunto F 5 C = C+1 si y solo si D1 se clasifica primero en el paso 4 6 FIN DE FOR 7 RETROME LA RELACIÓN C/J Figura 1: Pseudo-código para calcular FRC FRC se aproxima a la probabilidadque el primer documento clasificado en la lista original L permanecerá clasificado primero incluso después de que se perturben los documentos. Cuanto mayor sea la probabilidad, más confianza tenemos en el primer documento clasificado. Por otro lado, en el caso extremo de una clasificación aleatoria, la probabilidad sería tan baja como 0.5. Esperamos que FRC tenga una asociación positiva con el rendimiento de la consulta NP. Adoptamos [1] para implementar el paso de perturbación del documento (Paso 4 en la Fig.1) utilizando las distribuciones de Poisson. Para más detalles, remitimos al lector a [1].4. Evaluación ahora presentamos los resultados de predecir el rendimiento de la consulta por parte de nuestros modelos. Se adoptan tres técnicas de vanguardia como nuestras líneas de base. Evaluamos nuestras técnicas en una variedad de configuraciones de recuperación web. Como se mencionó anteriormente, consideramos dos tipos de consultas, es decir, consultas basadas en contenido (CB) y consultas de búsqueda de PAGE (NP). Primero, supongamos que se conocen los tipos de consultas. Investigamos la correlación entre el rendimiento de recuperación predicho y el rendimiento real para ambos tipos de consultas por separado. Los resultados muestran que nuestros métodos producen mejoras considerables sobre las líneas de base. Luego consideramos un escenario más desafiante en el que no hay información previa sobre los tipos de consultas disponibles. Se consideran dos subcases. En el primero, existe solo un tipo de consulta, pero el tipo real es desconocido. Asumimos una mezcla de los dos tipos de consultas en el segundo caso. Demostramos que nuestros modelos logran una buena precisión en este escenario exigente, haciendo que la predicción sea práctica en un entorno de búsqueda web del mundo real.4.1 Configuración experimental Nuestra evaluación se centra en la colección Gov2 que contiene aproximadamente 25 millones de documentos arrastrados de los sitios web en el dominio .gov durante 2004 [3]. Creamos dos tipos de conjuntos de datos para consultas CB y consultas NP respectivamente. Para el tipo CB, utilizamos los temas ad-hoc de las pistas de terabyte de 2004, 2005 y 2006 y los nombramos TB04-ADHOC, TB05-ADHOC y TB06-ADHOC respectivamente. Además, también utilizamos los temas ad-hoc de la pista robusta de 2004 (RT04) para probar la adaptabilidad de nuestras técnicas a un entorno no WEB. Para las consultas NP, utilizamos los temas de búsqueda de páginas nombradas de las pistas de terabyte de 2005 y 2006 y los nombramos TB05-NP y TB06-NP respectivamente. Todas las consultas utilizadas en nuestros experimentos son títulos de temas de TREC mientras nos centramos en la recuperación web. La Tabla 3 resume los conjuntos de datos anteriores. Nombre de recopilación Tema de tema Tipo de consulta TB04-ADHOC GOV2 701-750 CB TB05-ADHOC GOV2 751-800 CB TB06-ADHOC GOV2 801-850 CB RT04 DISCO 4+5 (MINUS CR) 301-450; 601700 CB TB05-NP GOV2 NP601-NP872 NP TB06-NP GOV2 NP901-NP1081 NP Tabla 3: Resumen de colecciones de pruebas y temas El rendimiento de recuperación de las consultas individuales basadas en contenido y NP se mide por la precisión promedio y el rango recíproco de la primera respuesta correcta respectivamente. Usamos el modelo de campo aleatorio de Markov para la recuperación ad-hoc y nombrada de la página. Adoptamos la misma configuración de parámetros de recuperación utilizados en [8,9]. El motor de búsqueda de Indri [12] se usa para todos nuestros experimentos. Aunque no se informó aquí, también probamos el modelo de probabilidad de consulta para la recuperación ad-hoc y descubrimos que los resultados cambian poco debido a la muy alta correlación entre los rendimientos de consulta obtenidos por los dos modelos de recuperación (0.96 medidos por el coeficiente de Pearsons).4.2 Tipos de consultas conocidos Suponga que se conocen los tipos de consultas. Tratamos cada tipo de consulta por separado y medimos la correlación con precisión promedio (o el rango recíproco en el caso de las consultas NP). Adoptamos la prueba de correlación de los Pearson que refleja el grado de relación lineal entre el rendimiento de recuperación predicho y el real.4.2.1 Consultas basadas en contenido Métodos Claridad robusta JSD WIG QF WIG +QF TB04 +0 5 ADHOC 0.333 0.317 0.362 0.574 0.480 0.637 TB06 ADHOC 0.076 0.294 N/A 0.464 0.422 0.511 Tabla 4: Coeficientes de la correlación de Pearsons para la correlación con la correlación de promedio en el promedio de la correlación de la correlación de promedio en el promedio de la correlación de la correlación de promedio en el promedio de la correlación del promedio en el promedio de la correlación del promedio en el promedio de la correlación de la correlación del promedio.Pistas de terabyte (AD-HOC) para una puntuación de claridad, puntaje de robustez, el método basado en JSD (citamos directamente el puntaje informado en [2]), WIG, retroalimentación de consultas (QF) y una combinación lineal de WIG y QF. Los casos en negrita significan que los resultados son estadísticamente significativos en el nivel de 0.01. La Tabla 4 muestra la correlación con precisión promedio en dos conjuntos de datos: uno es una combinación de TB04-ADHOC y TB05-ADHOC (100 temas en total) y el otro es TB06-ADHOC (50 temas). La razón por la que colocamos TB04-ADHOC y TB05-ADHOC juntos es hacer que nuestros resultados sean comparables a [2]. Nuestras líneas de base son el puntaje de claridad (claridad) [6], el puntaje de robustez (robusto) [1] y el método basado en JSD (JSD) [2]. Para la puntuación de claridad y robustez, hemos probado diferentes configuraciones de parámetros e informamos los coeficientes de correlación más altos que hemos encontrado. Citamos directamente el resultado del método basado en JSD informado en [2]. La tabla también muestra los resultados para el método de ganancia de información ponderada (WIG) y el método de retroalimentación de consultas (QF) para predecir consultas basadas en contenido. Como describimos en la sección anterior, tanto WIG como QF tienen un parámetro libre para establecer, es decir, el rango de corte K. Entrenamos el parámetro en un conjunto de datos y probamos en el otro. Al combinar WIG y QF, se usa una combinación lineal simple y el peso de la combinación se aprende del conjunto de datos de entrenamiento. A partir de estos resultados, podemos ver que nuestros métodos son considerablemente más precisos en comparación con las líneas de base. También observamos que se obtienen más mejoras de la combinación de WIG y QF, lo que sugiere que miden diferentes propiedades del proceso de recuperación que se relacionan con el rendimiento. Descubrimos que nuestros métodos se generalizan bien en TB06-ADHOC, mientras que la correlación para el puntaje de claridad con el rendimiento de recuperación en este conjunto de datos es considerablemente peor. Una investigación adicional muestra que la precisión promedio media de TB06-ADHOC es 0.342 y es aproximadamente un 10% mejor que la del primer conjunto de datos. Mientras que los otros tres métodos generalmente consideran los 100 principales documentos o menos dados una lista clasificada, el método de claridad generalmente necesita los 500 o más documentos principales para medir adecuadamente la coherencia de una lista clasificada. La precisión promedio media más alta hace que las listas clasificadas recuperen por diferentes consultas más similares en términos de coherencia al nivel de los 500 documentos principales. Creemos que esta es la razón principal de la baja precisión del puntaje de claridad en el segundo conjunto de datos. Aunque este documento se centra en un entorno de búsqueda web, es deseable que nuestras técnicas funcionen constantemente bien en otras situaciones. Con este fin, examinamos la efectividad de nuestras técnicas en la sólida pista de 2004. Para nuestros métodos, dividimos uniformemente todas las consultas de prueba en cinco grupos y realizamos una validación cruzada de cinco veces. Cada vez que usamos un grupo para el entrenamiento y los cuatro grupos restantes para las pruebas. Hacemos uso de todas las consultas para nuestras dos líneas de base, es decir, el puntaje de claridad y el puntaje de robustez. Los parámetros para nuestras líneas de base son los mismos que los utilizados en [1]. Los resultados que se muestran en la Tabla 5 demuestran que la precisión de predicción de nuestros métodos está a la par con la de las dos líneas de base fuertes. Claridad WIG ROBUSTA QF 0.464 0.539 0.468 0.464 Tabla 5: Comparación de los coeficientes de correlación de Pearsons en la pista robusta de 2004 para una puntuación de claridad, puntaje de robustez, retroalimentación de pelucas y consultas (QF). Los casos en negrita significan que los resultados son estadísticamente significativos en el nivel de 0.01. Además, examinamos la sensibilidad de predicción de nuestros métodos al rango de corte K. Con respecto a la peluca, es bastante robusto K en las pistas de terabyte (2004-2006) mientras prefiere un pequeño valor de k como 5 en el 2004 robustePista. En otras palabras, un pequeño valor de K es una opción casi óptima para ambos tipos de pistas. Teniendo en cuenta el hecho de que todos los demás parámetros involucrados en WIG son fijos y, en consecuencia, los mismos para los dos casos, esto significa que la peluca puede lograr una precisión de predicción casi óptima en dos situaciones considerablemente diferentes con exactamente la misma configuración de parámetros. Con respecto a QF, prefiere un valor mayor de K, como 100 en las pistas de terabyte y un valor más pequeño de K, como 25 en la pista robusta de 2004.4.2.2 Consultas NP Adoptamos WIG y Cambio de primer rango (FRC) para predecir el rendimiento de NPQuery. También probamos una combinación lineal de los dos como en la sección anterior. El peso de la combinación se obtiene del otro conjunto de datos. Utilizamos la correlación con los rangos recíprocos medidos por la prueba de correlación de Pearsons para evaluar la calidad de la predicción. Los resultados se presentan en la Tabla 6. Nuevamente, nuestras líneas de base son el puntaje de claridad y el puntaje de robustez. Para hacer una comparación justa, sintonizamos el puntaje de claridad de diferentes maneras. Descubrimos que usar el primer documento clasificado para construir el modelo de consulta produce la mejor precisión de predicción. También intentamos utilizar la estructura de documentos utilizando la mezcla de modelos de lenguaje mencionados en la Sección 3.1. Se obtuvo poca mejora. Los coeficientes de correlación para el puntaje de claridad informado en la Tabla 6 son los mejores que hemos encontrado. Como podemos ver, nuestros métodos superan considerablemente la técnica de puntuación de claridad en ambas corridas. Esto confirma nuestra intuición de que el uso de una medida basada en coherencia como la puntuación de claridad es inapropiada para las consultas NP. Métodos claridad robusta. WIG FRC WIG+FRC TB05 -NP 0.150 -0.370 0.458 0.440 0.525 TB06 -NP 0.112 -0.160 0.478 0.386 0.515 Tabla 6: Pearsons Coeficientes de correlación para la correlación con rangos recíprocos en las pistas de Terabyte (NP) para el puntaje de la claridad de la claridad, la correlación, con la correlación con receptrocal rangos en las pistas de Terabyte (NP) para el puntaje de la claridad, el puntaje de claridad, la correlación con la correlación, las rangos recíprocos en las rango de Terabyte (NP) para el puntaje de claridad de PearsonEl primer cambio de rango (FRC) y una combinación lineal de WIG y FRC. Los casos en negrita significan que los resultados son estadísticamente significativos en el nivel de 0.01. Con respecto a la puntuación de robustez, también sintonizamos los parámetros e informamos lo mejor que hemos encontrado. Observamos una correlación negativa interesante y sorprendente con las filas recíprocas. Explicamos este hallazgo brevemente. Un puntaje de alta robustez significa que varios documentos clasificados en la lista de clasificación original todavía están altamente clasificados después de perturbar los documentos. La existencia de dichos documentos es un buen signo de alto rendimiento para las consultas basadas en el contenido, ya que estas consultas generalmente contienen una serie de documentos relevantes [1]. Sin embargo, con respecto a las consultas NP, una diferencia fundamental es que solo hay un documento relevante para cada consulta. La existencia de tales documentos puede confundir la función de clasificación y conducir a un bajo rendimiento de recuperación. Aunque existe la correlación negativa con el rendimiento de la recuperación, la fuerza de la correlación es más débil y menos consistente en comparación con nuestros métodos como se muestra en la Tabla 6. Según el análisis anterior, podemos ver que las técnicas de predicción actuales, como la puntuación de claridad y el puntaje de robustez que están diseñados principalmente para consultas basadas en el contenido, enfrentan desafíos significativos y son inadecuados para tratar consultas NP. Nuestras dos técnicas propuestas para consultas NP demuestran consistentemente una buena precisión de predicción, mostrando el éxito inicial en la resolución del problema de predecir el rendimiento para las consultas NP. Otro punto que queremos enfatizar es que el método WIG funciona bien para ambos tipos de consultas, una propiedad deseable que la mayoría de las técnicas de predicción carecen.4.3 Tipos de consultas desconocidas En esta sección, ejecutamos dos tipos de experimentos sin acceso a etiquetas de tipo de consulta. Primero, suponemos que solo existe un tipo de consulta, pero el tipo es desconocido. En segundo lugar, experimentamos una mezcla de consultas basadas en contenido y NP. Las siguientes dos subsecciones informarán resultados para las dos condiciones respectivamente.4.3.1 Solo existe un tipo, suponemos que todas las consultas son del mismo tipo, es decir, son consultas NP o consultas basadas en contenido. Elegimos WIG para lidiar con este caso porque muestra una buena precisión de predicción para ambos tipos de consultas en la sección anterior. Consideramos dos casos: (1) CB: Las 150 consultas de título de la tarea ad-hoc de las pistas de Terabyte 2004-2006 (2) NP: todas las consultas de 433 NP de la tarea de búsqueda de página con nombre de las pistas de Terabyte 2005 y 2006. Tomamos una estrategia simple etiquetando todas las consultas en cada caso como el mismo tipo (ya sea NP o CB), independientemente de su tipo real. El cálculo de WIG se basará en el tipo de consulta etiquetada en lugar del tipo real. Hay cuatro posibilidades con respecto a la relación entre el tipo real y el tipo etiquetado. La correlación con el rendimiento de recuperación bajo las cuatro posibilidades se presenta en la Tabla 7. Por ejemplo, el valor 0.445 en la intersección entre la segunda fila y la tercera columna muestra el coeficiente de correlación de Pearsons para la correlación con la precisión promedio cuando las consultas basadas en el contenido están etiquetadas incorrectamente como el tipo NP. En base a estos resultados, recomendamos tratar todas las consultas como el tipo NP cuando solo existe un tipo de consulta y no es factible la clasificación de consulta precisa, considerando el riesgo de que ocurra una gran pérdida de precisión si las consultas NP están etiquetadas incorrectamente como consultas basadas en el contenido. Estos resultados también demuestran la fuerte adaptabilidad de la peluca a diferentes tipos de consultas. CB (etiquetado) NP (marcado) CB (real) 0.536 0.445 NP (real) 0.174 0.467 Tabla 7: Comparación de los coeficientes de correlación de Pearson para la correlación con el rendimiento de la recuperación bajo cuatro posibilidades en las pistas de Terabyte (NP). Los casos en negrita significan que los resultados son estadísticamente significativos en el nivel de 0.01.4.3.2 Una mezcla de consultas basadas en contenido y NP Una mezcla de los dos tipos de consultas es una situación más realista que un motor de búsqueda web cumplirá. Evaluamos la precisión de la predicción por la precisión que se pueden identificar consultas de bajo rendimiento por el método de predicción suponiendo que los tipos de consultas reales son desconocidos (pero podemos predecir los tipos de consultas). Esta es una tarea desafiante porque tanto el rendimiento previsto como el real para un tipo de consulta puede ser incomparable a la del otro tipo. A continuación, discutimos cómo implementar nuestra evaluación. Creamos un grupo de consultas que consiste en todas las 150 consultas de título ad-hoc de Terabyte Track 2004-2006 y todas las consultas de 433 NP de Terabyte Track 2005 y 2006. Dividimos las consultas en el grupo en clases: bueno (mejor que el 50% de las consultas del mismo tipo en términos de rendimiento de recuperación) y mal (de lo contrario). De acuerdo con estos estándares, una consulta NP con el rango recíproco por encima de 0.2 o una consulta basada en el contenido con la precisión promedio superior a 0.315 se considerará como buena. Luego, cada vez que seleccionamos aleatoriamente una consulta Q del grupo con probabilidad P de que Q esté basado en contenido. Las consultas restantes se utilizan como datos de entrenamiento. Primero decidimos el tipo de consulta Q según un clasificador de consulta. A saber, el clasificador de consultas nos dice si la consulta Q está basada en NP o basada en el contenido. Basado en el tipo de consulta prevista y la puntuación calculada para la consulta Q mediante una técnica de predicción, se toma una decisión binaria sobre si la consulta Q es buena o mala al compararse con el umbral de puntaje del tipo de consulta prevista obtenida de los datos de capacitación. La precisión de la predicción se mide por la precisión de la decisión binaria. En nuestra implementación, reiteradamente tomamos una consulta de prueba del grupo de consultas y la precisión de la predicción se calcula como el porcentaje de decisiones correctas, es decir, se predice que una buena consulta (mala) es buena (mala). Es obvio que la adivinación aleatoria conducirá a una precisión del 50%. Tomemos el método de peluca, por ejemplo, para ilustrar el proceso. Dos umbrales de pelucas (uno para consultas NP y el otro para consultas basadas en el contenido) están capacitados maximizando la precisión de la predicción en los datos de capacitación. Cuando la consulta de prueba se etiqueta como el tipo NP (CB) por el clasificador de tipo de consulta, se predecirá que será bueno si y solo si la puntuación de la peluca para esta consulta está por encima del umbral de NP (CB). Se tomarán procedimientos similares para otras técnicas de predicción. Ahora presentamos brevemente el clasificador de tipo de consulta automática utilizado en este documento. Encontramos que la puntuación de robustez, aunque originalmente propuesta para la predicción del rendimiento, es un buen indicador de los tipos de consultas. Encontramos que, en promedio, las consultas basadas en el contenido tienen una puntuación de robustez mucho más alta que las consultas NP. Por ejemplo, la Figura 2 muestra las distribuciones de puntajes de robustez para NP y consultas basadas en contenido. Según este hallazgo, el clasificador de puntaje de robustez adjuntará una etiqueta NP (CB) a la consulta si el puntaje de robustez para la consulta está a continuación (arriba) un umbral entrenado a partir de los datos de entrenamiento.0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 -1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 NP Figura 2: Distribución de puntajes de robustez para consultas NP y CB. Las consultas NP son los temas de 252 NP de la pista de Terabyte 2005. Las consultas basadas en el contenido son el título de 150 ad-hoc de las pistas de Terabyte 2004-2006. Las distribuciones de probabilidad se estiman mediante el método de estimación de densidad del núcleo. Estrategias WIG-1 WIG-2 WIG-3 óptima P = 0.6 0.565 0.624 0.665 0.684 0.701 P = 0.4 0.567 0.633 0.654 0.673 0.696 Tabla 8: Comparación de la precisión de predicción para cinco estrategias en la situación de la Qiebred-Q. Dos formas de probar una consulta del grupo: (1) La consulta muestreada se basa en el contenido con la probabilidad p = 0.6.(Es decir, la consulta es NP con probabilidad 0.4) (2) Establezca la probabilidad p = 0.4. Consideramos cinco estrategias en nuestros experimentos. En la primera estrategia (denotada por robusta), utilizamos el puntaje de robustez para la predicción del rendimiento de la consulta con la ayuda de un clasificador de consulta perfecto que siempre asigna correctamente una consulta en una de las dos categorías (es decir, NP o CB). Esta estrategia representa el nivel de precisión de predicción que las técnicas de predicción actuales pueden lograr en una condición ideal de que se conocen los tipos de consultas. En las siguientes tres estrategias, el método de la peluca se adopta para la predicción del rendimiento. La diferencia entre los tres es que se utilizan tres clasificadores de consulta diferentes para cada estrategia: (1) El clasificador siempre clasifica una consulta en el tipo NP.(2) El clasificador de densidad de probabilidad de puntaje de robustez es el clasificador de puntaje robusto mencionado anteriormente.(3) El clasificador es perfecto. Estas tres estrategias son denotadas por WIG-1, WIG-2 y WIG-3 respectivamente. La razón por la que estamos interesados en WIG-1 se basa en los resultados de la Sección 4.3.1. En la última estrategia (denotada por Optimal) que sirve como un límite superior en qué tan bien podemos hacerlo hasta ahora, utilizamos completamente nuestras técnicas de predicción para cada tipo de consulta, suponiendo que esté disponible un clasificador de consulta perfecto. Específicamente, combinamos linealmente WIG y QF para consultas basadas en contenido y WIG y FRC para consultas NP. Los resultados para las cinco estrategias se muestran en la Tabla 8. Para cada estrategia, intentamos dos formas de probar una consulta del grupo: (1) La consulta muestreada es CB con probabilidad P = 0.6.(La consulta es NP con probabilidad 0.4) (2) Establezca la probabilidad p = 0.4. De la Tabla 8 podemos ver que en términos de precisión de predicción WIG-2 (el método de peluca con el clasificador de consulta automática) no solo es mejor que los dos primeros casos, sino que también está cerca de WIG-3 donde se supone un clasificador perfecto. Se observan algunas mejoras adicionales sobre WIG-3 cuando se combinan con otras técnicas de predicción. El mérito de WIG-2 es que proporciona una solución práctica para identificar automáticamente consultas de bajo rendimiento en un entorno de búsqueda web con tipos de consultas mixtas, que plantea obstáculos considerables para las técnicas de predicción tradicionales.5. Conclusiones y trabajo futuro hasta nuestro conocimiento, nuestro artículo es el primero en explorar a fondo la predicción del rendimiento de la consulta en entornos de búsqueda web. Demostramos que nuestros modelos dieron como resultado una mayor precisión de predicción que las técnicas publicadas anteriormente no especialmente diseñadas para escenarios de búsqueda web. En este documento, nos centramos en dos tipos de consultas en la búsqueda web: consultas de búsqueda basadas en contenido y nombradas (NP), correspondientes a la tarea de recuperación ad-hoc y la tarea de búsqueda de páginas nombradas respectivamente. Para ambos tipos de consultas web, se demostró que nuestros modelos de predicción son sustancialmente más precisos que las técnicas actuales de vanguardia. Además, consideramos un caso más realista de que no hay información previa sobre los tipos de consultas disponibles. Demostramos que el método de la peluca es particularmente adecuado para esta situación. Teniendo en cuenta la adaptabilidad de la peluquería a una variedad de colecciones y tipos de consultas, uno de nuestros planes futuros es aplicar este método para predecir la preferencia del usuario de los resultados de búsqueda en datos realistas recopilados de un motor de búsqueda comercial. Además de la precisión, otro problema importante con el que las técnicas de predicción tienen que tratar en un entorno web es la eficiencia. Afortunadamente, dado que la puntuación de la peluca se calcula sobre los términos y las frases que aparecen en la consulta, este cálculo puede ser muy eficiente con el soporte del índice. Por otro lado, el cálculo de QF y FRC es relativamente menos eficiente ya que QF necesita recuperar toda la colección dos veces y FRC necesita clasificar repetidamente los documentos perturbados. Cómo mejorar la eficiencia de QF y FRC es nuestro trabajo futuro. Además, las técnicas de predicción propuestas en este documento tienen el potencial de mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperación al combinarse con otras técnicas IR. Por ejemplo, nuestras técnicas se pueden incorporar a técnicas de modificación de consultas populares, como la expansión de consultas y la relajación de la consulta. Guiado por la predicción del rendimiento, podemos tomar una mejor decisión sobre cuándo o cómo modificar consultas para mejorar la efectividad de la recuperación. Nos gustaría llevar a cabo investigaciones en esta dirección en el futuro.6.

        "INTRODUCTION Query performance prediction has many applications in a variety of information retrieval (IR) areas such as improving retrieval consistency, query refinement, and distributed IR.",
        "The importance of this problem has been recognized by IR researchers and a number of new methods have been proposed for prediction recently [1, 2, 17].",
        "Most work on prediction has focused on the traditional ad-hoc retrieval task where query performance is measured according to topical relevance.",
        "These prediction models are evaluated on TREC document collections which typically consist of no more than one million relatively homogenous newswire articles.",
        "With the popularity and influence of the Web, prediction techniques that will work well for web-style queries are highly preferable.",
        "However, web search environments pose significant challenges to current prediction models that are mainly designed for traditional TREC settings.",
        "Here we outline some of these challenges.",
        "First, web collections, which are much larger than conventional TREC collections, include a variety of documents that are different in many aspects such as quality and style.",
        "Current prediction techniques can be vulnerable to these characteristics of web collections.",
        "For example, the reported prediction accuracy of the ranking robustness technique and the clarity technique on the GOV2 collection (a large web collection) is significantly worse compared to the other TREC collections [1].",
        "Similar prediction accuracy on the GOV2 collection using another technique is reported in [2], confirming the difficult of predicting query performance on a large web collection.",
        "Furthermore, web search goes beyond the scope of the ad-hoc retrieval task based on topical relevance.",
        "For example, the Named-Page (NP) finding task, which is a navigational task, is also popular in web retrieval.",
        "Query performance prediction for the NP task is still necessary since NP retrieval performance is far from perfect.",
        "In fact, according to the report on the NP task of the 2005 Terabyte Track [3], about 40% of the test queries perform poorly (no correct answer in the first 10 search results) even in the best run from the top group.",
        "To our knowledge, little research has explicitly addressed the problem of NP-query performance prediction.",
        "Current prediction models devised for content-based queries will be less effective for NP queries considering the fundamental differences between the two.",
        "Third, in real-world web search environments, user queries are usually a mixture of different types and prior knowledge about the type of each query is generally unavailable.",
        "The mixed-query situation raises new problems for query performance prediction.",
        "For instance, we may need to incorporate a query classifier into prediction models.",
        "Despite these problems, the ability to handle this situation is a crucial step towards turning query performance prediction from an interesting research topic into a practical tool for web retrieval.",
        "In this paper, we present three techniques to address the above challenges that current prediction models face in Web search environments.",
        "Our work focuses on query performance prediction for the content-based (ad-hoc) retrieval task and the name-page finding task in the context of web retrieval.",
        "Our first technique, called weighted information gain (WIG), makes use of both single term and term proximity features to estimate the quality of top retrieved documents for prediction.",
        "We find that WIG offers consistent prediction accuracy across various test collections and query types.",
        "Moreover, we demonstrate that good prediction accuracy can be achieved for the mixed-query situation by using WIG with the help of a query type classifier.",
        "Query feedback and first rank change, which are our second and third prediction techniques, perform well for content-based queries and NP queries respectively.",
        "Our main contributions include: (1) considerably improved prediction accuracy for web content-based queries over several state-of-the-art techniques. (2) new techniques for successfully predicting NP-query performance. (3) a practical and fully automatic solution to predicting mixed-query performance.",
        "In addition, one minor contribution is that we find that the robustness score [1], which was originally proposed for performance prediction, is helpful for query classification. 2.",
        "RELATED WORK As we mentioned in the introduction, a number of prediction techniques have been proposed recently that focus on contentbased queries in the topical relevance (ad-hoc) task.",
        "We know of no published work that addresses other types of queries such as NP queries, let alone a mixture of query types.",
        "Next we review some representative models.",
        "The major difficulty of performance prediction comes from the fact that many factors have an impact on retrieval performance.",
        "Each factor affects performance to a different degree and the overall effect is hard to predict accurately.",
        "Therefore, it is not surprising to notice that simple features, such as the frequency of query terms in the collection [4] and the average IDF of query terms [5], do not predict well.",
        "In fact, most of the successful techniques are based on measuring some characteristics of the retrieved document set to estimate topic difficulty.",
        "For example, the clarity score [6] measures the coherence of a list of documents by the KL-divergence between the query model and the collection model.",
        "The robustness score [1] quantifies another property of a ranked list: the robustness of the ranking in the presence of uncertainty.",
        "Carmel et al. [2] found that the distance measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the retrieved document set and the collection is significantly correlated to average precision.",
        "Vinay et al. [7] proposed four measures to capture the geometry of the top retrieved documents for prediction.",
        "The most effective measure is the sensitivity to document perturbation, an idea somewhat similar to the robustness score.",
        "Unfortunately, their way of measuring the sensitivity does not perform equally well for short queries and prediction accuracy drops considerably when a state-of-the-art retrieval technique (like Okapi or a language modeling approach) is adopted for retrieval instead of the tf-idf weighting used in their paper [16].",
        "The difficulties of applying these models in web search environments have already been mentioned.",
        "In this paper, we mainly adopt the clarity score and the robustness score as our baselines.",
        "We experimentally show that the baselines, even after being carefully tuned, are inadequate for the web environment.",
        "One of our prediction models, WIG, is related to the Markov random field (MRF) model for information retrieval [8].",
        "The MRF model directly models term dependence and is found be to highly effective across a variety of test collections (particularly web collections) and retrieval tasks.",
        "This model is used to estimate the joint probability distribution over documents and queries, an important part of WIG.",
        "The superiority of WIG over other prediction techniques based on unigram features, which will be demonstrated later in our paper, coincides with that of MRF for retrieval.",
        "In other word, it is interesting to note that term dependence, when being modeled appropriately, can be helpful for both improving and predicting retrieval performance. 3.",
        "PREDICTION MODELS 3.1 Weighted Information Gain (WIG) This section introduces a weighted information gain approach that incorporates both single term and proximity features for predicting performance for both content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries.",
        "Given a set of queries Q={Qs} (s=1,2,..N) which includes all possible user queries and a set of documents D={Dt} (t=1,2…M), we assume that each query-document pair (Qs,Dt) is manually judged and will be put in a relevance list if Qs is found to be relevant to Dt.",
        "The joint probability P(Qs,Dt) over queries Q and documents D denotes the probability that pair (Qs,Dt) will be in the relevance list.",
        "Such assumptions are similar to those used in [8].",
        "Assuming that the user issues query Qi ∈Q and the retrieval results in response to Qi is a ranked list L of documents, we calculate the amount of information contained in P(Qs,Dt) with respect to Qi and L by Eq.1 which is a variant of entropy called the weighted entropy[13].",
        "The weights in Eq.1 are solely determined by Qi and L. )1(),(log),(),( , , ∑−= ts tststsLQ DQPDQweightDQH i In this paper, we choose the weights as follows: LindocumentsKtopthecontainsLTwhere otherwise LTDandisifK DQweight K Kt ts )( )2( ,0 )(,/1 ),( ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ ∈= = The cutoff rank K is a parameter in our model that will be discussed later.",
        "Accordingly, Eq.1 can be simplified as follows: )3(),(log 1 ),( )( , ∑∈ −= LTD titsLQ Kt i DQP K DQH Unfortunately, weighted entropy ),(, tsLQ DQH i computed by Eq.3, which represents the amount of information about how likely the top ranked documents in L would be relevant to query Qi on average, cannot be compared across different queries, making it inappropriate for directly predicting query performance.",
        "To mitigate this problem, we come up with a background distribution P(Qs,C) over Q and D by imagining that every document in D is replaced by the same special document C which represents average language usage.",
        "In this paper, C is created by concatenating every document in D. Roughly speaking, C is the collection (the document set) {Dt} without document boundaries.",
        "Similarly, weighted entropy ),(, CQH sLQi calculated by Eq.3 represents the amount of information about how likely an average document (represented by the whole collection) would be relevant to query Qi.",
        "Now we introduce our performance predictor WIG which is the weighted information gain [13] computed as the difference between ),(, tsLQ DQH i and ),(, CQH sLQi .Specifically, given query Qi, collection C and ranked list L of documents, WIG is calculated as follows: )4( ),( ),( log 1 ),( ),( log),( ),(),(),,( )(, ,, ∑∑ ∈ == −= LTD i ti ts s ts ts tsLQsLQi Kt ii CQP DQP KCQP DQP DQweight DQHCQHLCQWIG WIG computed by Eq.4 measures the change in information about the quality of retrieval (in response to query Qi) from an imaginary state that only an average document is retrieved to a posterior state that the actual search results are observed.",
        "We hypothesize that WIG is positively correlated with retrieval effectiveness because high quality retrieval should be much more effective than just returning the average document.",
        "The heart of this technique is how to estimate the joint distribution P(Qs,Dt).",
        "In the language modeling approach to IR, a variety of models can be applied readily to estimate this distribution.",
        "Although most of these models are based on the bagof-words assumption, recent work on modeling term dependence under the language modeling framework have shown consistent and significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over bagof-words models.",
        "Inspired by the success of incorporating term proximity features into language models, we decide to adopt a good dependence model to estimate the probability P(Qs,Dt).",
        "The model we chose for this paper is Metzler and Crofts Markov Random Field (MRF) model, which has already demonstrated superiority over a number of collections and different retrieval tasks [8,9].",
        "According to the MRF model, log P(Qi, Dt) can be written as )5()|(loglog),(log )( 1 ∑∈ +−= iQF tti DPZDQP ξ ξ ξλ where Z1 is a constant that ensures that P(Qi, Dt) sums up to 1.",
        "F(Qi) consists of a set of features expanded from the original query Qi .",
        "For example, assuming that query Qi is talented student program, F(Qi) includes features like program and talented student.",
        "We consider two kinds of features: single term features T and proximity features P. Proximity features include exact phrase (#1) and unordered window (#uwN) features as described in [8].",
        "Note that F(Qi) is the union of T(Qi) and P(Qi).",
        "For more details on F(Qi) such as how to expand the original query Qi to F(Qi), we refer the reader to [8] and [9].",
        "P(ξ|Dt) denotes the probability that feature ξ will occur in Dt.",
        "More details on P(ξ|Dt) will be provided later in this section.",
        "The choice of λξ is somewhat different from that used in [8] since λξ plays a dual role in our model.",
        "The first role, which is the same as in [8], is to weight between single term and proximity features.",
        "The other role, which is specific to our prediction task, is to normalize the size of F(Qi).We found that the following weight strategy for λξ satisfies the above two roles and generalizes well on a variety of collections and query types. )6( )(, |)(| 1 )(, |)(| ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎧ ∈ − ∈ = i i T i i T QP QP QT QT ξ λ ξ λ λξ where |T(Qi)| and |P(Qi)| denote the number of single term and proximity features in F(Qi) respectively.",
        "The reason for choosing the square root function in the denominator of λξ is to penalize a feature set of large size appropriately, making WIG more comparable across queries of various lengths. λT is a fixed parameter and set to 0.8 according to [8] throughout this paper.",
        "Similarly, log P(Qi,C) can be written as: )7()|(loglog),(log )( 2 ∑∈ +−= iQF i CPZCQP ξ ξ ξλ When constant Z1 and Z2 are dropped, WIG computed in Eq.4 can be rewritten as follows by plugging in Eq.5 and Eq.7 : )8( )|( )|( log 1 ),,( )( )( ∑ ∑∈ ∈ = LTD QF t i Kt i CP DP K LCQWIG ξ ξ ξ ξ λ One of the advantages of WIG over other techniques is that it can handle well both content-based and NP queries.",
        "Based on the type (or the predicted type) of Qi, the calculation of WIG in Eq. 8 differs in two aspects: (1) how to estimate P(ξ|Dt) and P(ξ|C), and (2) how to choose K. For content-based queries, P(ξ|C) is estimated by the relative frequency of feature ξ in collection C as a whole.",
        "The estimation of P(ξ|Dt) is the same as in [8].",
        "Namely, we estimate P(ξ|Dt) by the relative frequency of feature ξ in Dt linearly smoothed with collection frequency P(ξ|C).",
        "K in Eq.8 is treated as a free parameter.",
        "Note that K is the only free parameter in the computation of WIG for content-based queries because all parameters involved in P(ξ|Dt) are assumed to be fixed by taking the suggested values in [8].",
        "Regarding NP queries, we make use of document structure to estimate P(ξ|Dt) and P(ξ|C) by the so-called mixture of language models proposed in [10] and incorporated into the MRF model for Named-Page finding retrieval in [9].",
        "The basic idea is that a document (collection) is divided into several fields such as the title field, the main-body field and the heading field.",
        "P(ξ|Dt) and P(ξ|C) are estimated by a linear combination of the language models from each field.",
        "Due to space constraints, we refer the reader to [9] for details.",
        "We adopt the exact same set of parameters as used in [9] for estimation.",
        "With regard to K in Eq.8, we set K to 1 because the Named-Page finding task heavily focuses on the first ranked document.",
        "Consequently, there are no free parameters in the computation of WIG for NP queries. 3.2 Query Feedback In this section, we introduce another technique called query feedback (QF) for prediction.",
        "Suppose that a user issues query Q to a retrieval system and a ranked list L of documents is returned.",
        "We view the retrieval system as a noisy channel.",
        "Specifically, we assume that the output of the channel is L and the input is Q.",
        "After going through the channel, Q becomes corrupted and is transformed to ranked list L. By thinking about the retrieval process this way, the problem of predicting retrieval effectiveness turns to the task of evaluating the quality of the channel.",
        "In other words, prediction becomes finding a way to measure the degree of corruption that arises when Q is transformed to L. As directly computing the degree of the corruption is difficult, we tackle this problem by approximation.",
        "Our main idea is that we measure to what extent information on Q can be recovered from L on the assumption that only L is observed.",
        "Specifically, we design a decoder that can accurately translate L back into new query Q and the similarity S between the original query Q and the new query Q is adopted as a performance predictor.",
        "This is a sketch of how the QF technique predicts query performance.",
        "Before filling in more details, we briefly discuss why this method would work.",
        "There is a relation between the similarity S defined above and retrieval performance.",
        "On the one hand, if the retrieval has strayed from the original sense of the query Q, the new query Q extracted from ranked list L in response to Q would be very different from the original query Q.",
        "On the other hand, a query distilled from a ranked list containing many relevant documents is likely to be similar to the original query.",
        "Further examples in support of the relation will be provided later.",
        "Next we detail how to build the decoder and how to measure the similarity S. In essence, the goal of the decoder is to compress ranked list L into a few informative terms that should represent the content of the top ranked documents in L. Our approach to this goal is to represent ranked list L by a language model (distribution over terms).",
        "Then terms are ranked by their contribution to the language models KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence from the background collection model.",
        "Top ranked terms will be chosen to form the new query Q.",
        "This approach is similar to that used in Section 4.1 of [11].",
        "Specifically, we take three steps to compress ranked list L into query Q without referring to the original query. 1.",
        "We adopt the ranked list language model [14], to estimate a language model based on ranked list L. The model can be written as: )9()|()|()|( ∑∈ = LD LDPDwPLwP where w is any term, D is a document.",
        "P(D|L) is estimated by a linearly decreasing function of the rank of document D. 2.",
        "Each term in P(w|L) is ranked by the following KL-divergence contribution: )10( )|( )|( log)|( CwP LwP LwP where P(w|C) is the collection model estimated by the relative frequency of term w in collection C as a whole. 3.",
        "The top N ranked terms by Eq.10 form a weighted query Q={(wi,ti)} i=1,N. where wi denotes the i-th ranked term and weight ti is the KL-divergence contribution of wi in Eq. 10.",
        "Term cruise ship vessel sea passenger KL contribution 0.050 0.040 0.012 0.010 0.009 Table 1: top 5 terms compressed from the ranked list in response to query Cruise ship damage sea life Two representative examples, one for a poorly performing query Cruise ship damage sea life (TREC topic 719; average precision: 0.08) and the other for a high performing query prostate cancer treatments( TREC topic 710; average precision: 0.49), are shown in Table 1 and 2 respectively.",
        "These examples indicate how the similarity between the original and the new query correlates with retrieval performance.",
        "The parameter N in step 3 is set to 20 empirically and choosing a larger value of N is unnecessary since the weights after the top 20 are usually too small to make any difference.",
        "Term prostate cancer treatment men therapy KL contribution 0.177 0.140 0.028 0.025 0.020 Table 2: top 5 terms compressed from the ranked list in response to query prostate cancer treatments To measure the similarity between original query Q and new query Q, we first use Q to do retrieval on the same collection.",
        "A variant of the query likelihood model [15] is adopted for retrieval.",
        "Namely, documents are ranked by: )11()|()|( ),( ∑∈ = Qtw t i ii i DwPDQP where wi is a term in Q and ti is the associated weight.",
        "D is a document.",
        "Let L denote the new ranked list returned from the above retrieval.",
        "The similarity is measured by the overlap of documents in L and L. Specifically, the percentage of documents in the top K documents of L that are also present in the top K documents in L. the cutoff K is treated as a free parameter.",
        "We summarize here how the QF technique predicts performance given a query Q and the associated ranked list L. We first obtain a weighted query Q compressed from L by the above three steps.",
        "Then we use Q to perform retrieval and the new ranked list is L. The overlap of documents in L and L is used for prediction. 3.3 First Rank Change (FRC) In this section, we propose a method called the first rank change (FRC) for performance prediction for NP queries.",
        "This method is derived from the ranking robustness technique [1] that is mainly designed for content-based queries.",
        "When directly applied to NP queries, the robustness technique will be less effective because it takes the top ranked documents as a whole into account while NP queries usually have only one single relevant document.",
        "Instead, our technique focuses on the first rank document while the main idea of the robustness method remains.",
        "Specifically, the pseudocode for computing FRC is shown in figure 1.",
        "Input: (1) ranked list L={Di} where i=1,100.",
        "Di denotes the i-th ranked document. (2) query Q 1 initialize: (1) set the number of trials J=100000 (2) counter c=0; 2 for i=1 to J 3 Perturb every document in L, let the outcome be a set F={Di} where Di denotes the perturbed version of Di. 4 Do retrieval with query Q on set F 5 c=c+1 if and only if D1 is ranked first in step 4 6 end of for 7 return the ratio c/J Figure 1: pseudo-code for computing FRC FRC approximates the probability that the first ranked document in the original list L will remain ranked first even after the documents are perturbed.",
        "The higher the probability is, the more confidence we have in the first ranked document.",
        "On the other hand, in the extreme case of a random ranking, the probability would be as low as 0.5.",
        "We expect that FRC has a positive association with NP query performance.",
        "We adopt [1] to implement the document perturbation step (step 4 in Fig.1) using Poisson distributions.",
        "For more details, we refer the reader to [1]. 4.",
        "EVALUATION We now present the results of predicting query performance by our models.",
        "Three state-of-the-art techniques are adopted as our baselines.",
        "We evaluate our techniques across a variety of Web retrieval settings.",
        "As mentioned before, we consider two types of queries, that is, content-based (CB) queries and Named-Page(NP) finding queries.",
        "First, suppose that the query types are known.",
        "We investigate the correlation between the predicted retrieval performance and the actual performance for both types of queries separately.",
        "Results show that our methods yield considerable improvements over the baselines.",
        "We then consider a more challenging scenario where no prior information on query types is available.",
        "Two sub-cases are considered.",
        "In the first one, there exists only one type of query but the actual type is unknown.",
        "We assume a mixture of the two query types in the second case.",
        "We demonstrate that our models achieve good accuracy under this demanding scenario, making prediction practical in a real-world Web search environment. 4.1 Experimental Setup Our evaluation focuses on the GOV2 collection which contains about 25 million documents crawled from web sites in the .gov domain during 2004 [3].",
        "We create two kinds of data set for CB queries and NP queries respectively.",
        "For the CB type, we use the ad-hoc topics of the Terabyte Tracks of 2004, 2005 and 2006 and name them TB04-adhoc, TB05-adhoc and TB06-adhoc respectively.",
        "In addition, we also use the ad-hoc topics of the 2004 Robust Track (RT04) to test the adaptability of our techniques to a non-Web environment.",
        "For NP queries, we use the Named-Page finding topics of the Terabyte Tracks of 2005 and 2006 and we name them TB05-NP and TB06-NP respectively.",
        "All queries used in our experiments are titles of TREC topics as we center on web retrieval.",
        "Table 3 summarizes the above data sets.",
        "Name Collection Topic Number Query Type TB04-adhoc GOV2 701-750 CB TB05-adhoc GOV2 751-800 CB TB06-adhoc GOV2 801-850 CB RT04 Disk 4+5 (minus CR) 301-450;601700 CB TB05-NP GOV2 NP601-NP872 NP TB06-NP GOV2 NP901-NP1081 NP Table 3: Summary of test collections and topics Retrieval performance of individual content-based and NP queries is measured by the average precision and reciprocal rank of the first correct answer respectively.",
        "We make use of the Markov Random field model for both ad-hoc and Named-Page finding retrieval.",
        "We adopt the same setting of retrieval parameters used in [8,9].",
        "The Indri search engine [12] is used for all of our experiments.",
        "Though not reported here, we also tried the query likelihood model for ad-hoc retrieval and found that the results change little because of the very high correlation between the query performances obtained by the two retrieval models (0.96 measured by Pearsons coefficient). 4.2 Known Query Types Suppose that query types are known.",
        "We treat each type of query separately and measure the correlation with average precision (or the reciprocal rank in the case of NP queries).",
        "We adopt the Pearsons correlation test which reflects the degree of linear relationship between the predicted and the actual retrieval performance. 4.2.1 Content-based Queries Methods Clarity Robust JSD WIG QF WIG +QF TB04+0 5 adhoc 0.333 0.317 0.362 0.574 0.480 0.637 TB06 adhoc 0.076 0.294 N/A 0.464 0.422 0.511 Table 4: Pearsons correlation coefficients for correlation with average precision on the Terabyte Tracks (ad-hoc) for clarity score, robustness score, the JSD-based method(we directly cites the score reported in [2]), WIG, query feedback(QF) and a linear combination of WIG and QF.",
        "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level.",
        "Table 4 shows the correlation with average precision on two data sets: one is a combination of TB04-adhoc and TB05-adhoc(100 topics in total) and the other is TB06-adhoc (50 topics).",
        "The reason that we put TB04-adhoc and TB05-adhoc together is to make our results comparable to [2].",
        "Our baselines are the clarity score (clarity) [6],the robustness score (robust)[1] and the JSDbased method (JSD) [2].",
        "For the clarity and robustness score, we have tried different parameter settings and report the highest correlation coefficients we have found.",
        "We directly cite the result of the JSD-based method reported in [2].",
        "The table also shows the results for the Weighted Information Gain (WIG) method and the Query Feedback (QF) method for predicting content-based queries.",
        "As we described in the previous section, both WIG and QF have one free parameter to set, that is, the cutoff rank K. We train the parameter on one dataset and test on the other.",
        "When combining WIG and QF, a simple linear combination is used and the combination weight is learned from the training data set.",
        "From these results, we can see that our methods are considerably more accurate compared to the baselines.",
        "We also observe that further improvements are obtained from the combination of WIG and QF, suggesting that they measure different properties of the retrieval process that relate to performance.",
        "We discover that our methods generalize well on TB06-adhoc while the correlation for the clarity score with retrieval performance on this data set is considerably worse.",
        "Further investigation shows that the mean average precision of TB06-adhoc is 0.342 and is about 10% better than that of the first data set.",
        "While the other three methods typically consider the top 100 or less documents given a ranked list, the clarity method usually needs the top 500 or more documents to adequately measure the coherence of a ranked list.",
        "Higher mean average precision makes ranked lists retrieved by different queries more similar in terms of coherence at the level of top 500 documents.",
        "We believe that this is the main reason for the low accuracy of the clarity score on the second data set.",
        "Though this paper focuses on a Web search environment, it is desirable that our techniques will work consistently well in other situations.",
        "To this end, we examine the effectiveness of our techniques on the Robust 2004 Track.",
        "For our methods, we evenly divide all of the test queries into five groups and perform five-fold cross validation.",
        "Each time we use one group for training and the remaining four groups for testing.",
        "We make use of all of the queries for our two baselines, that is, the clarity score and the robustness score.",
        "The parameters for our baselines are the same as those used in [1].The results shown in Table 5 demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of our methods is on a par with that of the two strong baselines.",
        "Clarity Robust WIG QF 0.464 0.539 0.468 0.464 Table 5: Comparison of Pearsons correlation coefficients on the 2004 Robust Track for clarity score, robustness score, WIG and query feedback (QF).",
        "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level.",
        "Furthermore, we examine the prediction sensitivity of our methods to the cutoff rank K. With respect to WIG, it is quite robust to K on the Terabyte Tracks (2004-2006) while it prefers a small value of K like 5 on the 2004 Robust Track.",
        "In other words, a small value of K is a nearly-optimal choice for both kinds of tracks.",
        "Considering the fact that all other parameters involved in WIG are fixed and consequently the same for the two cases, this means WIG can achieve nearly-optimal prediction accuracy in two considerably different situations with exactly the same parameter setting.",
        "Regarding QF, it prefers a larger value of K such as 100 on the Terabyte Tracks and a smaller value of K such as 25 on the 2004 Robust Track. 4.2.2 NP Queries We adopt WIG and first rank change (FRC) for predicting NPquery performance.",
        "We also try a linear combination of the two as in the previous section.",
        "The combination weight is obtained from the other data set.",
        "We use the correlation with the reciprocal ranks measured by the Pearsons correlation test to evaluate prediction quality.",
        "The results are presented in Table 6.",
        "Again, our baselines are the clarity score and the robustness score.",
        "To make a fair comparison, we tune the clarity score in different ways.",
        "We found that using the first ranked document to build the query model yields the best prediction accuracy.",
        "We also attempted to utilize document structure by using the mixture of language models mentioned in section 3.1.",
        "Little improvement was obtained.",
        "The correlation coefficients for the clarity score reported in Table 6 are the best we have found.",
        "As we can see, our methods considerably outperform the clarity score technique on both of the runs.",
        "This confirms our intuition that the use of a coherence-based measure like the clarity score is inappropriate for NP queries.",
        "Methods Clarity Robust.",
        "WIG FRC WIG+FRC TB05-NP 0.150 -0.370 0.458 0.440 0.525 TB06-NP 0.112 -0.160 0.478 0.386 0.515 Table 6: Pearsons correlation coefficients for correlation with reciprocal ranks on the Terabyte Tracks (NP) for clarity score, robustness score, WIG, the first rank change (FRC) and a linear combination of WIG and FRC.",
        "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level.",
        "Regarding the robustness score, we also tune the parameters and report the best we have found.",
        "We observe an interesting and surprising negative correlation with reciprocal ranks.",
        "We explain this finding briefly.",
        "A high robustness score means that a number of top ranked documents in the original ranked list are still highly ranked after perturbing the documents.",
        "The existence of such documents is a good sign of high performance for content-based queries as these queries usually contain a number of relevant documents [1].",
        "However, with regard to NP queries, one fundamental difference is that there is only one relevant document for each query.",
        "The existence of such documents can confuse the ranking function and lead to low retrieval performance.",
        "Although the negative correlation with retrieval performance exists, the strength of the correlation is weaker and less consistent compared to our methods as shown in Table 6.",
        "Based on the above analysis, we can see that current prediction techniques like clarity score and robustness score that are mainly designed for content-based queries face significant challenges and are inadequate to deal with NP queries.",
        "Our two techniques proposed for NP queries consistently demonstrate good prediction accuracy, displaying initial success in solving the problem of predicting performance for NP queries.",
        "Another point we want to stress is that the WIG method works well for both types of queries, a desirable property that most prediction techniques lack. 4.3 Unknown Query Types In this section, we run two kinds of experiments without access to query type labels.",
        "First, we assume that only one type of query exists but the type is unknown.",
        "Second, we experiment on a mixture of content-based and NP queries.",
        "The following two subsections will report results for the two conditions respectively. 4.3.1 Only One Type exists We assume that all queries are of the same type, that is, they are either NP queries or content-based queries.",
        "We choose WIG to deal with this case because it shows good prediction accuracy for both types of queries in the previous section.",
        "We consider two cases: (1) CB: all 150 title queries from the ad-hoc task of the Terabyte Tracks 2004-2006 (2)NP: all 433 NP queries from the named page finding task of the Terabyte Tracks 2005 and 2006.",
        "We take a simple strategy by labeling all of the queries in each case as the same type (either NP or CB) regardless of their actual type.",
        "The computation of WIG will be based on the labeled query type instead of the actual type.",
        "There are four possibilities with respect to the relation between the actual type and the labeled type.",
        "The correlation with retrieval performance under the four possibilities is presented in Table 7.",
        "For example, the value 0.445 at the intersection between the second row and the third column shows the Pearsons correlation coefficient for correlation with average precision when the content-based queries are incorrectly labeled as the NP type.",
        "Based on these results, we recommend treating all queries as the NP type when only one query type exists and accurate query classification is not feasible, considering the risk that a large loss of accuracy will occur if NP queries are incorrectly labeled as content-based queries.",
        "These results also demonstrate the strong adaptability of WIG to different query types.",
        "CB (labeled) NP (labeled) CB (actual) 0.536 0.445 NP (actual) 0.174 0.467 Table 7: Comparison of Pearsons correlation coefficients for correlation with retrieval performance under four possibilities on the Terabyte Tracks (NP).",
        "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet.",
        "We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types).",
        "This is a challenging task because both the predicted and actual performance for one type of query can be incomparable to that for the other type.",
        "Next we discuss how to implement our evaluation.",
        "We create a query pool which consists of all of the 150 ad-hoc title queries from Terabyte Track 2004-2006 and all of the 433 NP queries from Terabyte Track 2005&2006.",
        "We divide the queries in the pool into classes: good (better than 50% of the queries of the same type in terms of retrieval performance) and bad (otherwise).",
        "According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a content-based query with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good.",
        "Then, each time we randomly select one query Q from the pool with probability p that Q is contented-based.",
        "The remaining queries are used as training data.",
        "We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier.",
        "Namely, the query classifier tells us whether query Q is NP or content-based.",
        "Based on the predicted query type and the score computed for query Q by a prediction technique, a binary decision is made about whether query Q is good or bad by comparing to the score threshold of the predicted query type obtained from the training data.",
        "Prediction accuracy is measured by the accuracy of the binary decision.",
        "In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad).",
        "It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy.",
        "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
        "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",
        "When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold.",
        "Similar procedures will be taken for other prediction techniques.",
        "Now we briefly introduce the automatic query type classifier used in this paper.",
        "We find that the robustness score, though originally proposed for performance prediction, is a good indicator of query types.",
        "We find that on average content-based queries have a much higher robustness score than NP queries.",
        "For example, Figure 2 shows the distributions of robustness scores for NP and content-based queries.",
        "According to this finding, the robustness score classifier will attach a NP (CB) label to the query if the robustness score for the query is below (above) a threshold trained from the training data. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 -1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 NP Content-based Figure 2: Distribution of robustness scores for NP and CB queries.",
        "The NP queries are the 252 NP topics from the 2005 Terabyte Track.",
        "The content-based queries are the 150 ad-hoc title from the Terabyte Tracks 2004-2006.",
        "The probability distributions are estimated by the Kernel density estimation method.",
        "Strategies Robust WIG-1 WIG-2 WIG-3 Optimal p=0.6 0.565 0.624 0.665 0.684 0.701 P=0.4 0.567 0.633 0.654 0.673 0.696 Table 8: Comparison of prediction accuracy for five strategies in the mixed-query situation.",
        "Two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is content-based with the probability p=0.6. (that is, the query is NP with probability 0.4 ) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
        "We consider five strategies in our experiments.",
        "In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB).",
        "This strategy represents the level of prediction accuracy that current prediction techniques can achieve in an ideal condition that query types are known.",
        "In the next following three strategies, the WIG method is adopted for performance prediction.",
        "The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",
        "These three strategies are denoted by WIG-1, WIG-2 and WIG-3 respectively.",
        "The reason we are interested in WIG-1 is based on the results from section 4.3.1.",
        "In the last strategy (denoted by Optimal) which serves as an upper bound on how well we can do so far, we fully make use of our prediction techniques for each query type assuming a perfect query classifier is available.",
        "Specifically, we linearly combine WIG and QF for content-based queries and WIG and FRC for NP queries.",
        "The results for the five strategies are shown in Table 8.",
        "For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
        "From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.",
        "Some further improvements over WIG-3 are observed when combined with other prediction techniques.",
        "The merit of WIG-2 is that it provides a practical solution to automatically identifying poorly performing queries in a Web search environment with mixed query types, which poses considerable obstacles to traditional prediction techniques. 5.",
        "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.",
        "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.",
        "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.",
        "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
        "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
        "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
        "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
        "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
        "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
        "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
        "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
        "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
        "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",
        "Guided by performance prediction, we can make a better decision on when to or how to modify queries to enhance retrieval effectiveness.",
        "We would like to carry out research in this direction in the future. 6.",

Bruce Croft Department of Computer Science University of Massachusetts, Amherst {yzhou, croft}@cs.umass.edu ABSTRACT Current prediction techniques, which are generally designed for content-based queries and are typically evaluated on relatively homogenous test collections of small sizes, face serious challenges in web search environments where collections are significantly more heterogeneous and different types of retrieval tasks exist.",

                "The importance of this problem has been recognized by IR researchers and a number of new methods have been proposed for prediction recently [1, 2, 17].",
                "Most work on prediction has focused on the traditional ad-hoc retrieval task where query performance is measured according to topical relevance.",
                "These prediction models are evaluated on TREC document collections which typically consist of no more than one million relatively homogenous newswire articles.",
                "With the popularity and influence of the Web, prediction techniques that will work well for web-style queries are highly preferable.",
                "However, web search environments pose significant challenges to current prediction models that are mainly designed for traditional TREC settings.",
                "Here we outline some of these challenges.",
                "First, web collections, which are much larger than conventional TREC collections, include a variety of documents that are different in many aspects such as quality and style.",
                "Current prediction techniques can be vulnerable to these characteristics of web collections.",
                "For example, the reported prediction accuracy of the ranking robustness technique and the clarity technique on the GOV2 collection (a large web collection) is significantly worse compared to the other TREC collections [1].",
                "Similar prediction accuracy on the GOV2 collection using another technique is reported in [2], confirming the difficult of predicting query performance on a large web collection.",
                "Furthermore, web search goes beyond the scope of the ad-hoc retrieval task based on topical relevance.",
                "For example, the Named-Page (NP) finding task, which is a navigational task, is also popular in web retrieval.",
                "<br>query performance prediction</br> for the NP task is still necessary since NP retrieval performance is far from perfect.",
                "In fact, according to the report on the NP task of the 2005 Terabyte Track [3], about 40% of the test queries perform poorly (no correct answer in the first 10 search results) even in the best run from the top group.",
                "To our knowledge, little research has explicitly addressed the problem of NP-<br>query performance prediction</br>.",
                "Current prediction models devised for content-based queries will be less effective for NP queries considering the fundamental differences between the two.",
                "Third, in real-world web search environments, user queries are usually a mixture of different types and prior knowledge about the type of each query is generally unavailable.",
                "The mixed-query situation raises new problems for <br>query performance prediction</br>.",
                "For instance, we may need to incorporate a query classifier into prediction models.",
                "Despite these problems, the ability to handle this situation is a crucial step towards turning <br>query performance prediction</br> from an interesting research topic into a practical tool for web retrieval.",
                "In this paper, we present three techniques to address the above challenges that current prediction models face in Web search environments.",
                "Our work focuses on <br>query performance prediction</br> for the content-based (ad-hoc) retrieval task and the name-page finding task in the context of web retrieval.",

(2) new techniques for successfully predicting NP-query performance. (3) a practical and fully automatic solution to predicting mixed-query performance.",
                "In addition, one minor contribution is that we find that the robustness score [1], which was originally proposed for performance prediction, is helpful for query classification. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK As we mentioned in the introduction, a number of prediction techniques have been proposed recently that focus on contentbased queries in the topical relevance (ad-hoc) task.",
                "We know of no published work that addresses other types of queries such as NP queries, let alone a mixture of query types.",
                "Next we review some representative models.",
                "The major difficulty of performance prediction comes from the fact that many factors have an impact on retrieval performance.",
                "Each factor affects performance to a different degree and the overall effect is hard to predict accurately.",
                "Therefore, it is not surprising to notice that simple features, such as the frequency of query terms in the collection [4] and the average IDF of query terms [5], do not predict well.",
                "In fact, most of the successful techniques are based on measuring some characteristics of the retrieved document set to estimate topic difficulty.",
                "For example, the clarity score [6] measures the coherence of a list of documents by the KL-divergence between the query model and the collection model.",
                "The robustness score [1] quantifies another property of a ranked list: the robustness of the ranking in the presence of uncertainty.",
                "Carmel et al. [2] found that the distance measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the retrieved document set and the collection is significantly correlated to average precision.",
                "Vinay et al. [7] proposed four measures to capture the geometry of the top retrieved documents for prediction.",
                "The most effective measure is the sensitivity to document perturbation, an idea somewhat similar to the robustness score.",
                "Unfortunately, their way of measuring the sensitivity does not perform equally well for short queries and prediction accuracy drops considerably when a state-of-the-art retrieval technique (like Okapi or a language modeling approach) is adopted for retrieval instead of the tf-idf weighting used in their paper [16].",
                "The difficulties of applying these models in web search environments have already been mentioned.",
                "In this paper, we mainly adopt the clarity score and the robustness score as our baselines.",
                "We experimentally show that the baselines, even after being carefully tuned, are inadequate for the web environment.",
                "One of our prediction models, WIG, is related to the Markov random field (MRF) model for information retrieval [8].",
                "The MRF model directly models term dependence and is found be to highly effective across a variety of test collections (particularly web collections) and retrieval tasks.",
                "This model is used to estimate the joint probability distribution over documents and queries, an important part of WIG.",

                "Next we detail how to build the decoder and how to measure the similarity S. In essence, the goal of the decoder is to compress ranked list L into a few informative terms that should represent the content of the top ranked documents in L.

                "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet.",

                "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
                "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",

                "The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",
                "These three strategies are denoted by WIG-1, WIG-2 and WIG-3 respectively.",

                "Some further improvements over WIG-3 are observed when combined with other prediction techniques.",
                "The merit of WIG-2 is that it provides a practical solution to automatically identifying poorly performing queries in a Web search environment with mixed query types, which poses considerable obstacles to traditional prediction techniques. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.",
                "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.",
                "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.",
                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
                "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
                "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
                "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
                "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",
                "Guided by performance prediction, we can make a better decision on when to or how to modify queries to enhance retrieval effectiveness.",

                "We take a simple strategy by labeling all of the queries in each case as the same type (either NP or CB) regardless of their actual type.",
                "The computation of WIG will be based on the labeled query type instead of the actual type.",
                "There are four possibilities with respect to the relation between the actual type and the labeled type.",
                "The correlation with retrieval performance under the four possibilities is presented in Table 7.",
                "For example, the value 0.445 at the intersection between the second row and the third column shows the Pearsons correlation coefficient for correlation with average precision when the content-based queries are incorrectly labeled as the NP type.",

                "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet.",
                "We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types).",
                "This is a challenging task because both the predicted and actual performance for one type of query can be incomparable to that for the other type.",

                "According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a content-based query with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good.",
                "Then, each time we randomly select one query Q from the pool with probability p that Q is contented-based.",
                "The remaining queries are used as training data.",
                "We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier.",
                "Namely, the query classifier tells us whether query Q is NP or content-based.",
                "Based on the predicted query type and the score computed for query Q by a prediction technique, a binary decision is made about whether query Q is good or bad by comparing to the score threshold of the predicted query type obtained from the training data.",
                "Prediction accuracy is measured by the accuracy of the binary decision.",
                "In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad).",
                "It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy.",
                "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
                "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",
                "When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold.",
                "Similar procedures will be taken for other prediction techniques.",
                "Now we briefly introduce the automatic query type classifier used in this paper.",

                "In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB).",
                "This strategy represents the level of prediction accuracy that current prediction techniques can achieve in an ideal condition that query types are known.",
                "In the next following three strategies, the WIG method is adopted for performance prediction.",
                "The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",
                "These three strategies are denoted by WIG-1, WIG-2 and WIG-3 respectively.",
                "The reason we are interested in WIG-1 is based on the results from section 4.3.1.",
                "In the last strategy (denoted by Optimal) which serves as an upper bound on how well we can do so far, we fully make use of our prediction techniques for each query type assuming a perfect query classifier is available.",
                "Specifically, we linearly combine WIG and QF for content-based queries and WIG and FRC for NP queries.",
                "The results for the five strategies are shown in Table 8.",
                "For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
                "From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.",
                "Some further improvements over WIG-3 are observed when combined with other prediction techniques.",
                "The merit of WIG-2 is that it provides a practical solution to automatically identifying poorly performing queries in a <br>web search environment</br> with mixed query types, which poses considerable obstacles to traditional prediction techniques. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.",
                "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.",
                "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.",
                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
                "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
                "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
                "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
                "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",
                "Guided by performance prediction, we can make a better decision on when to or how to modify queries to enhance retrieval effectiveness.",

                "Next we detail how to build the decoder and how to measure the similarity S. In essence, the goal of the decoder is to compress ranked list L into a few informative terms that should represent the content of the top ranked documents in L. Our approach to this goal is to represent ranked list L by a language model (distribution over terms).",

                "Further investigation shows that the mean average precision of TB06-adhoc is 0.342 and is about 10% better than that of the first data set.",
                "While the other three methods typically consider the top 100 or less documents given a ranked list, the clarity method usually needs the top 500 or more documents to adequately measure the coherence of a ranked list.",
                "Higher mean average precision makes ranked lists retrieved by different queries more similar in terms of coherence at the level of top 500 documents.",
                "We believe that this is the main reason for the low accuracy of the clarity score on the second data set.",
                "Though this paper focuses on a Web search environment, it is desirable that our techniques will work consistently well in other situations.",
                "To this end, we examine the effectiveness of our techniques on the Robust 2004 Track.",
                "For our methods, we evenly divide all of the test queries into five groups and perform five-fold cross validation.",

                "A high robustness score means that a number of top ranked documents in the original ranked list are still highly ranked after perturbing the documents.",
                "The existence of such documents is a good sign of high performance for content-based queries as these queries usually contain a number of relevant documents [1].",
                "However, with regard to NP queries, one fundamental difference is that there is only one relevant document for each query.",

                "Although the negative correlation with retrieval performance exists, the strength of the correlation is weaker and less consistent compared to our methods as shown in Table 6.",
                "Based on the above analysis, we can see that current prediction techniques like clarity score and robustness score that are mainly designed for content-based queries face significant challenges and are inadequate to deal with NP queries.",

                "We consider two cases: (1) CB: all 150 title queries from the ad-hoc task of the Terabyte Tracks 2004-2006 (2)NP: all 433 NP queries from the named page finding task of the Terabyte Tracks 2005 and 2006.",
                "We take a simple strategy by labeling all of the queries in each case as the same type (either NP or CB) regardless of their actual type.",
                "The computation of WIG will be based on the labeled query type instead of the actual type.",
                "There are four possibilities with respect to the relation between the actual type and the labeled type.",
                "The correlation with retrieval performance under the four possibilities is presented in Table 7.",
                "For example, the value 0.445 at the intersection between the second row and the third column shows the Pearsons correlation coefficient for correlation with average precision when the content-based queries are incorrectly labeled as the NP type.",
                "Based on these results, we recommend treating all queries as the NP type when only one query type exists and accurate query classification is not feasible, considering the risk that a large loss of accuracy will occur if NP queries are incorrectly labeled as content-based queries.",
                "These results also demonstrate the strong adaptability of WIG to different query types.",

                "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet.",
                "We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types).",
                "This is a challenging task because both the predicted and actual performance for one type of query can be incomparable to that for the other type.",
                "Next we discuss how to implement our evaluation.",
                "We create a query pool which consists of all of the 150 ad-hoc title queries from Terabyte Track 2004-2006 and all of the 433 NP queries from Terabyte Track 2005&2006.",
                "We divide the queries in the pool into classes: good (better than 50% of the queries of the same type in terms of retrieval performance) and bad (otherwise).",
                "According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a <br>content-based query</br> with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good.",
                "Then, each time we randomly select one query Q from the pool with probability p that Q is contented-based.",
                "The remaining queries are used as training data.",
                "We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier.",
                "Namely, the query classifier tells us whether query Q is NP or content-based.",
                "Based on the predicted query type and the score computed for query Q by a prediction technique, a binary decision is made about whether query Q is good or bad by comparing to the score threshold of the predicted query type obtained from the training data.",
                "Prediction accuracy is measured by the accuracy of the binary decision.",
                "In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad).",
                "It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy.",
                "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
                "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",
                "When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold.",
                "Similar procedures will be taken for other prediction techniques.",

                "We find that the robustness score, though originally proposed for performance prediction, is a good indicator of query types.",
                "We find that on average content-based queries have a much higher robustness score than NP queries.",
                "For example, Figure 2 shows the distributions of robustness scores for NP and content-based queries.",

                "In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB).",
                "This strategy represents the level of prediction accuracy that current prediction techniques can achieve in an ideal condition that query types are known.",
                "In the next following three strategies, the WIG method is adopted for performance prediction.",
                "The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",
                "These three strategies are denoted by WIG-1, WIG-2 and WIG-3 respectively.",
                "The reason we are interested in WIG-1 is based on the results from section 4.3.1.",
                "In the last strategy (denoted by Optimal) which serves as an upper bound on how well we can do so far, we fully make use of our prediction techniques for each query type assuming a perfect query classifier is available.",
                "Specifically, we linearly combine WIG and QF for content-based queries and WIG and FRC for NP queries.",
                "The results for the five strategies are shown in Table 8.",
                "For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
                "From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.",
                "Some further improvements over WIG-3 are observed when combined with other prediction techniques.",
                "The merit of WIG-2 is that it provides a practical solution to automatically identifying poorly performing queries in a Web search environment with mixed query types, which poses considerable obstacles to traditional prediction techniques. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.",
                "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.",
                "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.",
                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
                "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
                "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
                "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
                "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",

                "Next we detail how to build the decoder and how to measure the similarity S. In essence, the goal of the decoder is to compress ranked list L into a few informative terms that should represent the content of the top ranked documents in L. Our approach to this goal is to represent ranked list L by a language model (distribution over terms).",

                "When directly applied to NP queries, the robustness technique will be less effective because it takes the top ranked documents as a whole into account while NP queries usually have only one single relevant document.",
                "Instead, our technique focuses on the first rank document while the main idea of the robustness method remains.",
                "Specifically, the pseudocode for computing FRC is shown in figure 1.",

                "Higher mean average precision makes ranked lists retrieved by different queries more similar in terms of coherence at the level of top 500 documents.",
                "We believe that this is the main reason for the low accuracy of the clarity score on the second data set.",
                "Though this paper focuses on a Web search environment, it is desirable that our techniques will work consistently well in other situations.",
                "To this end, we examine the effectiveness of our techniques on the Robust 2004 Track.",

                "Although the negative correlation with retrieval performance exists, the strength of the correlation is weaker and less consistent compared to our methods as shown in Table 6.",
                "Based on the above analysis, we can see that current prediction techniques like clarity score and robustness score that are mainly designed for content-based queries face significant challenges and are inadequate to deal with NP queries.",

                "Another point we want to stress is that the WIG method works well for both types of queries, a desirable property that most prediction techniques lack. 4.3 Unknown Query Types In this section, we run two kinds of experiments without access to query type labels.",

                "We consider two cases: (1) CB: all 150 title queries from the ad-hoc task of the Terabyte Tracks 2004-2006 (2)NP: all 433 NP queries from the named page finding task of the Terabyte Tracks 2005 and 2006.",
                "We take a simple strategy by labeling all of the queries in each case as the same type (either NP or CB) regardless of their actual type.",
                "The computation of WIG will be based on the labeled query type instead of the actual type.",
                "There are four possibilities with respect to the relation between the actual type and the labeled type.",
                "The correlation with retrieval performance under the four possibilities is presented in Table 7.",
                "For example, the value 0.445 at the intersection between the second row and the third column shows the Pearsons correlation coefficient for correlation with average precision when the content-based queries are incorrectly labeled as the NP type.",
                "Based on these results, we recommend treating all queries as the NP type when only one query type exists and accurate query classification is not feasible, considering the risk that a large loss of accuracy will occur if NP queries are incorrectly labeled as content-based queries.",
                "These results also demonstrate the strong adaptability of WIG to different query types.",

                "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet.",
                "We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types).",
                "This is a challenging task because both the predicted and actual performance for one type of query can be incomparable to that for the other type.",
                "Next we discuss how to implement our evaluation.",
                "We create a query pool which consists of all of the 150 ad-hoc title queries from Terabyte Track 2004-2006 and all of the 433 NP queries from Terabyte Track 2005&2006.",
                "We divide the queries in the pool into classes: good (better than 50% of the queries of the same type in terms of retrieval performance) and bad (otherwise).",
                "According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a content-based query with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good.",
                "Then, each time we randomly select one query Q from the pool with probability p that Q is contented-based.",
                "The remaining queries are used as training data.",
                "We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier.",
                "Namely, the query classifier tells us whether query Q is NP or content-based.",
                "Based on the predicted query type and the score computed for query Q by a prediction technique, a binary decision is made about whether query Q is good or bad by comparing to the score threshold of the predicted query type obtained from the training data.",
                "Prediction accuracy is measured by the accuracy of the binary decision.",
                "In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad).",
                "It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy.",
                "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
                "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",
                "When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold.",
                "Similar procedures will be taken for other prediction techniques.",
                "Now we briefly introduce the automatic query type classifier used in this paper.",

                "We find that on average content-based queries have a much higher robustness score than NP queries.",
                "For example, Figure 2 shows the distributions of robustness scores for NP and content-based queries.",
                "According to this finding, the robustness score classifier will attach a NP (CB) label to the query if the robustness score for the query is below (above) a threshold trained from the training data. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 -1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 NP Content-based Figure 2: Distribution of robustness scores for NP and CB queries.",

                "In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB).",
                "This strategy represents the level of prediction accuracy that current prediction techniques can achieve in an ideal condition that query types are known.",
                "In the next following three strategies, the WIG method is adopted for performance prediction.",
                "The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",
                "These three strategies are denoted by WIG-1, WIG-2 and WIG-3 respectively.",
                "The reason we are interested in WIG-1 is based on the results from section 4.3.1.",
                "In the last strategy (denoted by Optimal) which serves as an upper bound on how well we can do so far, we fully make use of our prediction techniques for each query type assuming a perfect query classifier is available.",
                "Specifically, we linearly combine WIG and QF for content-based queries and WIG and FRC for NP queries.",
                "The results for the five strategies are shown in Table 8.",
                "For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
                "From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.",
                "Some further improvements over WIG-3 are observed when combined with other prediction techniques.",
                "The merit of WIG-2 is that it provides a practical solution to automatically identifying poorly performing queries in a Web search environment with mixed query types, which poses considerable obstacles to traditional prediction techniques. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.",
                "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.",
                "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.",
                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
                "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
                "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
                "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
                "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",

                "The computation of WIG will be based on the labeled query type instead of the actual type.",
                "There are four possibilities with respect to the relation between the actual type and the labeled type.",

                "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet.",
                "We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types).",
                "This is a challenging task because both the predicted and actual performance for one type of query can be incomparable to that for the other type.",

                "We divide the queries in the pool into classes: good (better than 50% of the queries of the same type in terms of retrieval performance) and bad (otherwise).",
                "According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a content-based query with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good.",
                "Then, each time we randomly select one query Q from the pool with probability p that Q is contented-based.",
                "The remaining queries are used as training data.",
                "We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier.",
                "Namely, the query classifier tells us whether query Q is NP or content-based.",
                "Based on the predicted query type and the score computed for query Q by a prediction technique, a binary decision is made about whether query Q is good or bad by comparing to the score threshold of the predicted query type obtained from the training data.",
                "Prediction accuracy is measured by the accuracy of the binary decision.",
                "In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad).",
                "It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy.",
                "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
                "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",
                "When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold.",
                "Similar procedures will be taken for other prediction techniques.",
                "Now we briefly introduce the automatic query type classifier used in this paper.",

                "In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB).",
                "This strategy represents the level of prediction accuracy that current prediction techniques can achieve in an ideal condition that query types are known.",
                "In the next following three strategies, the WIG method is adopted for performance prediction.",
                "The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",
                "These three strategies are denoted by WIG-1, WIG-2 and WIG-3 respectively.",
                "The reason we are interested in WIG-1 is based on the results from section 4.3.1.",
                "In the last strategy (denoted by Optimal) which serves as an upper bound on how well we can do so far, we fully make use of our prediction techniques for each query type assuming a perfect query classifier is available.",
                "Specifically, we linearly combine WIG and QF for content-based queries and WIG and FRC for NP queries.",
                "The results for the five strategies are shown in Table 8.",
                "For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
                "From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.",
                "Some further improvements over WIG-3 are observed when combined with other prediction techniques.",
                "The merit of WIG-2 is that it provides a practical solution to automatically identifying poorly performing queries in a Web search environment with mixed query types, which poses considerable obstacles to traditional prediction techniques. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.",
                "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.",
                "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.",
                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
                "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
                "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
                "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
                "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",

                "Similar prediction accuracy on the <br>gov2 collection</br> using another technique is reported in [2], confirming the difficult of predicting query performance on a large web collection.",

                "Query performance prediction for the NP task is still necessary since NP retrieval performance is far from perfect.",
                "In fact, according to the report on the NP task of the 2005 Terabyte Track [3], about 40% of the test queries perform poorly (no correct answer in the first 10 search results) even in the best run from the top group.",

                "Current prediction models devised for content-based queries will be less effective for NP queries considering the fundamental differences between the two.",

                "Another point we want to stress is that the WIG method works well for both types of queries, a desirable property that most prediction techniques lack. 4.3 Unknown Query Types In this section, we run two kinds of experiments without access to query type labels.",

                "We consider two cases: (1) CB: all 150 title queries from the ad-hoc task of the Terabyte Tracks 2004-2006 (2)NP: all 433 NP queries from the named page finding task of the Terabyte Tracks 2005 and 2006.",
                "We take a simple strategy by labeling all of the queries in each case as the same type (either NP or CB) regardless of their actual type.",
                "The computation of WIG will be based on the labeled query type instead of the actual type.",
                "There are four possibilities with respect to the relation between the actual type and the labeled type.",
                "The correlation with retrieval performance under the four possibilities is presented in Table 7.",
                "For example, the value 0.445 at the intersection between the second row and the third column shows the Pearsons correlation coefficient for correlation with average precision when the content-based queries are incorrectly labeled as the NP type.",
                "Based on these results, we recommend treating all queries as the NP type when only one query type exists and accurate query classification is not feasible, considering the risk that a large loss of accuracy will occur if NP queries are incorrectly labeled as content-based queries.",

                "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet.",
                "We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types).",
                "This is a challenging task because both the predicted and actual performance for one type of query can be incomparable to that for the other type.",
                "Next we discuss how to implement our evaluation.",
                "We create a query pool which consists of all of the 150 ad-hoc title queries from Terabyte Track 2004-2006 and all of the 433 NP queries from Terabyte Track 2005&2006.",
                "We divide the queries in the pool into classes: good (better than 50% of the queries of the same type in terms of retrieval performance) and bad (otherwise).",
                "According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a content-based query with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good.",
                "Then, each time we randomly select one query Q from the pool with probability p that Q is contented-based.",
                "The remaining queries are used as training data.",
                "We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier.",
                "Namely, the query classifier tells us whether query Q is NP or content-based.",
                "Based on the predicted query type and the score computed for query Q by a prediction technique, a binary decision is made about whether query Q is good or bad by comparing to the score threshold of the predicted query type obtained from the training data.",
                "Prediction accuracy is measured by the accuracy of the binary decision.",
                "In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad).",
                "It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy.",
                "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
                "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",
                "When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold.",
                "Similar procedures will be taken for other prediction techniques.",
                "Now we briefly introduce the automatic query type classifier used in this paper.",

                "We find that on average content-based queries have a much higher robustness score than NP queries.",
                "For example, Figure 2 shows the distributions of robustness scores for NP and content-based queries.",

                "In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB).",
                "This strategy represents the level of prediction accuracy that current prediction techniques can achieve in an ideal condition that query types are known.",
                "In the next following three strategies, the WIG method is adopted for performance prediction.",
                "The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",
                "These three strategies are denoted by WIG-1, WIG-2 and WIG-3 respectively.",
                "The reason we are interested in WIG-1 is based on the results from section 4.3.1.",
                "In the last strategy (denoted by Optimal) which serves as an upper bound on how well we can do so far, we fully make use of our prediction techniques for each query type assuming a perfect query classifier is available.",
                "Specifically, we linearly combine WIG and QF for content-based queries and WIG and FRC for NP queries.",
                "The results for the five strategies are shown in Table 8.",
                "For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
                "From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.",
                "Some further improvements over WIG-3 are observed when combined with other prediction techniques.",
                "The merit of WIG-2 is that it provides a practical solution to automatically identifying poorly performing queries in a Web search environment with mixed query types, which poses considerable obstacles to traditional prediction techniques. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.",
                "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.",
                "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.",
                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
                "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
                "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
                "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
                "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",
                "Guided by performance prediction, we can make a better decision on when to or how to modify queries to enhance retrieval effectiveness.",

                "We take a simple strategy by labeling all of the queries in each case as the same type (either NP or CB) regardless of their actual type.",
                "The computation of WIG will be based on the labeled query type instead of the actual type.",
                "There are four possibilities with respect to the relation between the actual type and the labeled type.",
                "The correlation with retrieval performance under the four possibilities is presented in Table 7.",
                "For example, the value 0.445 at the intersection between the second row and the third column shows the Pearsons correlation coefficient for correlation with average precision when the content-based queries are incorrectly labeled as the NP type.",

                "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet.",
                "We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types).",

                "In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad).",
                "It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy.",
                "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
                "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",
                "When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold.",

                "In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB).",
                "This strategy represents the level of prediction accuracy that current prediction techniques can achieve in an ideal condition that query types are known.",
                "In the next following three strategies, the WIG method is adopted for performance prediction.",
                "The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",
                "These three strategies are denoted by WIG-1, WIG-2 and WIG-3 respectively.",
                "The reason we are interested in WIG-1 is based on the results from section 4.3.1.",
                "In the last strategy (denoted by Optimal) which serves as an upper bound on how well we can do so far, we fully make use of our prediction techniques for each query type assuming a perfect query classifier is available.",
                "Specifically, we linearly combine WIG and QF for content-based queries and WIG and FRC for NP queries.",
                "The results for the five strategies are shown in Table 8.",
                "For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
                "From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.",
                "Some further improvements over WIG-3 are observed when combined with other prediction techniques.",
                "The merit of WIG-2 is that it provides a practical solution to automatically identifying poorly performing queries in a Web search environment with mixed query types, which poses considerable obstacles to traditional prediction techniques. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.",
                "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.",
                "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.",
                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
                "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
                "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
                "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
                "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",
                "Guided by performance prediction, we can make a better decision on when to or how to modify queries to enhance retrieval effectiveness.",

Bruce Croft Department of Computer Science University of Massachusetts, Amherst {yzhou, croft}@cs.umass.edu ABSTRACT Current prediction techniques, which are generally designed for content-based queries and are typically evaluated on relatively homogenous test collections of small sizes, face serious challenges in web search environments where collections are significantly more heterogeneous and different types of retrieval tasks exist.",
                "In this paper, we present three techniques to address these challenges.",
                "We focus on performance prediction for two types of queries in web search environments: content-based and Named-Page finding.",
                "Our evaluation is mainly performed on the GOV2 collection.",
                "In addition to evaluating our models for the two types of queries separately, we consider a more challenging and realistic situation that the two types of queries are mixed together without prior information on query types.",
                "To assist prediction under the mixed-query situation, a novel query classifier is adopted.",
                "Results show that our prediction of web query performance is substantially more accurate than the current stateof-the-art prediction techniques.",

                "INTRODUCTION Query performance prediction has many applications in a variety of information retrieval (IR) areas such as improving retrieval consistency, query refinement, and distributed IR.",
                "The importance of this problem has been recognized by IR researchers and a number of new methods have been proposed for prediction recently [1, 2, 17].",
                "Most work on prediction has focused on the traditional ad-hoc retrieval task where query performance is measured according to topical relevance.",
                "These prediction models are evaluated on TREC document collections which typically consist of no more than one million relatively homogenous newswire articles.",
                "With the popularity and influence of the Web, prediction techniques that will work well for web-style queries are highly preferable.",
                "However, web search environments pose significant challenges to current prediction models that are mainly designed for traditional TREC settings.",
                "Here we outline some of these challenges.",
                "First, web collections, which are much larger than conventional TREC collections, include a variety of documents that are different in many aspects such as quality and style.",
                "Current prediction techniques can be vulnerable to these characteristics of web collections.",
                "For example, the reported prediction accuracy of the ranking robustness technique and the clarity technique on the GOV2 collection (a large web collection) is significantly worse compared to the other TREC collections [1].",
                "Similar prediction accuracy on the GOV2 collection using another technique is reported in [2], confirming the difficult of predicting query performance on a large web collection.",
                "Furthermore, web search goes beyond the scope of the ad-hoc retrieval task based on topical relevance.",
                "For example, the Named-Page (NP) finding task, which is a navigational task, is also popular in web retrieval.",
                "Query performance prediction for the NP task is still necessary since NP retrieval performance is far from perfect.",
                "In fact, according to the report on the NP task of the 2005 Terabyte Track [3], about 40% of the test queries perform poorly (no correct answer in the first 10 search results) even in the best run from the top group.",
                "To our knowledge, little research has explicitly addressed the problem of NP-query performance prediction.",
                "Current prediction models devised for content-based queries will be less effective for NP queries considering the fundamental differences between the two.",
                "Third, in real-world web search environments, user queries are usually a mixture of different types and prior knowledge about the type of each query is generally unavailable.",
                "The mixed-query situation raises new problems for query performance prediction.",
                "For instance, we may need to incorporate a query classifier into prediction models.",

(2) new techniques for successfully predicting NP-query performance. (3) a practical and fully automatic solution to predicting mixed-query performance.",
                "In addition, one minor contribution is that we find that the robustness score [1], which was originally proposed for performance prediction, is helpful for <br>query classification</br>. 2.",

                "Next we review some representative models.",
                "The major difficulty of performance prediction comes from the fact that many factors have an impact on retrieval performance.",
                "Each factor affects performance to a different degree and the overall effect is hard to predict accurately.",
                "Therefore, it is not surprising to notice that simple features, such as the frequency of query terms in the collection [4] and the average IDF of query terms [5], do not predict well.",
                "In fact, most of the successful techniques are based on measuring some characteristics of the retrieved document set to estimate topic difficulty.",
                "For example, the clarity score [6] measures the coherence of a list of documents by the KL-divergence between the query model and the collection model.",
                "The robustness score [1] quantifies another property of a ranked list: the robustness of the ranking in the presence of uncertainty.",
                "Carmel et al. [2] found that the distance measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the retrieved document set and the collection is significantly correlated to average precision.",
                "Vinay et al. [7] proposed four measures to capture the geometry of the top retrieved documents for prediction.",
                "The most effective measure is the sensitivity to document perturbation, an idea somewhat similar to the robustness score.",
                "Unfortunately, their way of measuring the sensitivity does not perform equally well for short queries and prediction accuracy drops considerably when a state-of-the-art retrieval technique (like Okapi or a language modeling approach) is adopted for retrieval instead of the tf-idf weighting used in their paper [16].",
                "The difficulties of applying these models in web search environments have already been mentioned.",
                "In this paper, we mainly adopt the clarity score and the robustness score as our baselines.",
                "We experimentally show that the baselines, even after being carefully tuned, are inadequate for the web environment.",
                "One of our prediction models, WIG, is related to the Markov random field (MRF) model for information retrieval [8].",
                "The MRF model directly models term dependence and is found be to highly effective across a variety of test collections (particularly web collections) and retrieval tasks.",
                "This model is used to estimate the joint probability distribution over documents and queries, an important part of WIG.",
                "The superiority of WIG over other prediction techniques based on unigram features, which will be demonstrated later in our paper, coincides with that of MRF for retrieval.",
                "In other word, it is interesting to note that term dependence, when being modeled appropriately, can be helpful for both improving and predicting retrieval performance. 3.",
                "PREDICTION MODELS 3.1 Weighted Information Gain (WIG) This section introduces a weighted information gain approach that incorporates both single term and proximity features for predicting performance for both content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries.",
                "Given a set of queries Q={Qs} (s=1,2,..N) which includes all possible user queries and a set of documents D={Dt} (t=1,2…M), we assume that each query-document pair (Qs,Dt) is manually judged and will be put in a relevance list if Qs is found to be relevant to Dt.",
                "The joint probability P(Qs,Dt) over queries Q and documents D denotes the probability that pair (Qs,Dt) will be in the relevance list.",
                "Such assumptions are similar to those used in [8].",
                "Assuming that the user issues query Qi ∈Q and the retrieval results in response to Qi is a ranked list L of documents, we calculate the amount of information contained in P(Qs,Dt) with respect to Qi and L by Eq.1 which is a variant of entropy called the weighted entropy[13].",

                "To mitigate this problem, we come up with a background distribution P(Qs,C) over Q and D by imagining that every document in D is replaced by the same special document C which represents average language usage.",
                "In this paper, C is created by concatenating every document in D. Roughly speaking, C is the collection (the document set) {Dt} without document boundaries.",

                "We hypothesize that WIG is positively correlated with retrieval effectiveness because high quality retrieval should be much more effective than just returning the average document.",
                "The heart of this technique is how to estimate the joint distribution P(Qs,Dt).",

                "The other role, which is specific to our prediction task, is to normalize the size of F(Qi).We found that the following weight strategy for λξ satisfies the above two roles and generalizes well on a variety of collections and query types. )6( )(, |)(| 1 )(, |)(| ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎧ ∈ − ∈ = i i T i i T QP QP QT QT ξ λ ξ λ λξ where |T(Qi)| and |P(Qi)| denote the number of single term and proximity features in F(Qi) respectively.",
                "The reason for choosing the square root function in the denominator of λξ is to penalize a feature set of large size appropriately, making WIG more comparable across queries of various lengths. λT is a fixed parameter and set to 0.8 according to [8] throughout this paper.",

                "Based on the type (or the predicted type) of Qi, the calculation of WIG in Eq. 8 differs in two aspects: (1) how to estimate P(ξ|Dt) and P(ξ|C), and (2) how to choose K. For content-based queries, P(ξ|C) is estimated by the relative frequency of feature ξ in collection C as a whole.",
                "The estimation of P(ξ|Dt) is the same as in [8].",
                "Namely, we estimate P(ξ|Dt) by the relative frequency of feature ξ in Dt linearly smoothed with collection frequency P(ξ|C).",
                "K in Eq.8 is treated as a free parameter.",
                "Note that K is the only free parameter in the computation of WIG for content-based queries because all parameters involved in P(ξ|Dt) are assumed to be fixed by taking the suggested values in [8].",
                "Regarding NP queries, we make use of document structure to estimate P(ξ|Dt) and P(ξ|C) by the so-called mixture of language models proposed in [10] and incorporated into the MRF model for Named-Page finding retrieval in [9].",
                "The basic idea is that a document (collection) is divided into several fields such as the title field, the main-body field and the heading field.",
                "P(ξ|Dt) and P(ξ|C) are estimated by a linear combination of the language models from each field.",
                "Due to space constraints, we refer the reader to [9] for details.",

                "With regard to K in Eq.8, we set K to 1 because the Named-Page finding task heavily focuses on the first ranked document.",
                "Consequently, there are no free parameters in the computation of WIG for NP queries. 3.2 Query Feedback In this section, we introduce another technique called query feedback (QF) for prediction.",
                "Suppose that a user issues query Q to a retrieval system and a ranked list L of documents is returned.",
                "We view the retrieval system as a noisy channel.",
                "Specifically, we assume that the output of the channel is L and the input is Q.",
                "After going through the channel, Q becomes corrupted and is transformed to ranked list L. By thinking about the retrieval process this way, the problem of predicting retrieval effectiveness turns to the task of evaluating the quality of the channel.",
                "In other words, prediction becomes finding a way to measure the degree of corruption that arises when Q is transformed to L. As directly computing the degree of the corruption is difficult, we tackle this problem by approximation.",
                "Our main idea is that we measure to what extent information on Q can be recovered from L on the assumption that only L is observed.",
                "Specifically, we design a decoder that can accurately translate L back into new query Q and the similarity S between the original query Q and the new query Q is adopted as a performance predictor.",
                "This is a sketch of how the QF technique predicts query performance.",
                "Before filling in more details, we briefly discuss why this method would work.",
                "There is a relation between the similarity S defined above and retrieval performance.",
                "On the one hand, if the retrieval has strayed from the original sense of the query Q, the new query Q extracted from ranked list L in response to Q would be very different from the original query Q.",
                "On the other hand, a query distilled from a ranked list containing many relevant documents is likely to be similar to the original query.",
                "Further examples in support of the relation will be provided later.",
                "Next we detail how to build the decoder and how to measure the similarity S. In essence, the goal of the decoder is to compress ranked list L into a few informative terms that should represent the content of the top ranked documents in L. Our approach to this goal is to represent ranked list L by a language model (distribution over terms).",
                "Then terms are ranked by their contribution to the language models KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence from the background collection model.",
                "Top ranked terms will be chosen to form the new query Q.",
                "This approach is similar to that used in Section 4.1 of [11].",
                "Specifically, we take three steps to compress ranked list L into query Q without referring to the original query. 1.",
                "We adopt the ranked list language model [14], to estimate a language model based on ranked list L. The model can be written as: )9()|()|()|( ∑∈ = LD LDPDwPLwP where w is any term, D is a document.",

                "The top N ranked terms by Eq.10 form a weighted query Q={(wi,ti)} i=1,N. where wi denotes the i-th ranked term and weight ti is the KL-divergence contribution of wi in Eq. 10.",

                "This method is derived from the ranking robustness technique [1] that is mainly designed for content-based queries.",
                "When directly applied to NP queries, the robustness technique will be less effective because it takes the top ranked documents as a whole into account while NP queries usually have only one single relevant document.",
                "Instead, our technique focuses on the first rank document while the main idea of the robustness method remains.",
                "Specifically, the pseudocode for computing FRC is shown in figure 1.",
                "Input: (1) ranked list L={Di} where i=1,100.",

                "The higher the probability is, the more confidence we have in the first ranked document.",
                "On the other hand, in the extreme case of a random ranking, the probability would be as low as 0.5.",
                "We expect that FRC has a positive association with NP query performance.",

                "The existence of such documents is a good sign of high performance for content-based queries as these queries usually contain a number of relevant documents [1].",
                "However, with regard to NP queries, one fundamental difference is that there is only one relevant document for each query.",

                "The following two subsections will report results for the two conditions respectively. 4.3.1 Only One Type exists We assume that all queries are of the same type, that is, they are either NP queries or content-based queries.",
                "We choose WIG to deal with this case because it shows good prediction accuracy for both types of queries in the previous section.",
                "We consider two cases: (1) CB: all 150 title queries from the ad-hoc task of the Terabyte Tracks 2004-2006 (2)NP: all 433 NP queries from the named page finding task of the Terabyte Tracks 2005 and 2006.",
                "We take a simple strategy by labeling all of the queries in each case as the same type (either NP or CB) regardless of their actual type.",
                "The computation of WIG will be based on the labeled query type instead of the actual type.",
                "There are four possibilities with respect to the relation between the actual type and the labeled type.",
                "The correlation with retrieval performance under the four possibilities is presented in Table 7.",
                "For example, the value 0.445 at the intersection between the second row and the third column shows the Pearsons correlation coefficient for correlation with average precision when the content-based queries are incorrectly labeled as the NP type.",
                "Based on these results, we recommend treating all queries as the NP type when only one query type exists and accurate <br>query classification</br> is not feasible, considering the risk that a large loss of accuracy will occur if NP queries are incorrectly labeled as content-based queries.",
                "These results also demonstrate the strong adaptability of WIG to different query types.",

                "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet.",
                "We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types).",
                "This is a challenging task because both the predicted and actual performance for one type of query can be incomparable to that for the other type.",
                "Next we discuss how to implement our evaluation.",
                "We create a query pool which consists of all of the 150 ad-hoc title queries from Terabyte Track 2004-2006 and all of the 433 NP queries from Terabyte Track 2005&2006.",
                "We divide the queries in the pool into classes: good (better than 50% of the queries of the same type in terms of retrieval performance) and bad (otherwise).",
                "According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a content-based query with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good.",
                "Then, each time we randomly select one query Q from the pool with probability p that Q is contented-based.",
                "The remaining queries are used as training data.",
                "We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier.",
                "Namely, the query classifier tells us whether query Q is NP or content-based.",
                "Based on the predicted query type and the score computed for query Q by a prediction technique, a binary decision is made about whether query Q is good or bad by comparing to the score threshold of the predicted query type obtained from the training data.",
                "Prediction accuracy is measured by the accuracy of the binary decision.",
                "In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad).",
                "It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy.",
                "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
                "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",
                "When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold.",
                "Similar procedures will be taken for other prediction techniques.",
                "Now we briefly introduce the automatic query type classifier used in this paper.",
                "We find that the robustness score, though originally proposed for performance prediction, is a good indicator of query types.",
                "We find that on average content-based queries have a much higher robustness score than NP queries.",
                "For example, Figure 2 shows the distributions of robustness scores for NP and content-based queries.",
                "According to this finding, the robustness score classifier will attach a NP (CB) label to the query if the robustness score for the query is below (above) a threshold trained from the training data. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 -1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 NP Content-based Figure 2: Distribution of robustness scores for NP and CB queries.",

                "In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB).",
                "This strategy represents the level of prediction accuracy that current prediction techniques can achieve in an ideal condition that query types are known.",
                "In the next following three strategies, the WIG method is adopted for performance prediction.",
                "The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",
                "These three strategies are denoted by WIG-1, WIG-2 and WIG-3 respectively.",
                "The reason we are interested in WIG-1 is based on the results from section 4.3.1.",
                "In the last strategy (denoted by Optimal) which serves as an upper bound on how well we can do so far, we fully make use of our prediction techniques for each query type assuming a perfect query classifier is available.",
                "Specifically, we linearly combine WIG and QF for content-based queries and WIG and FRC for NP queries.",
                "The results for the five strategies are shown in Table 8.",
                "For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
                "From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.",
                "Some further improvements over WIG-3 are observed when combined with other prediction techniques.",
                "The merit of WIG-2 is that it provides a practical solution to automatically identifying poorly performing queries in a Web search environment with mixed query types, which poses considerable obstacles to traditional prediction techniques. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.",
                "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.",
                "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.",
                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
                "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
                "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
                "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
                "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",
                "Guided by performance prediction, we can make a better decision on when to or how to modify queries to enhance retrieval effectiveness.",

Bruce Croft Department of Computer Science University of Massachusetts, Amherst {yzhou, croft}@cs.umass.edu ABSTRACT Current prediction techniques, which are generally designed for content-based queries and are typically evaluated on relatively homogenous test collections of small sizes, face serious challenges in web search environments where collections are significantly more heterogeneous and different types of retrieval tasks exist.",
                "In this paper, we present three techniques to address these challenges.",
                "We focus on performance prediction for two types of queries in web search environments: content-based and Named-Page finding.",
                "Our evaluation is mainly performed on the GOV2 collection.",
                "In addition to evaluating our models for the two types of queries separately, we consider a more challenging and realistic situation that the two types of queries are mixed together without prior information on query types.",
                "To assist prediction under the mixed-query situation, a novel query classifier is adopted.",
                "Results show that our prediction of web query performance is substantially more accurate than the current stateof-the-art prediction techniques.",

                "The importance of this problem has been recognized by IR researchers and a number of new methods have been proposed for prediction recently [1, 2, 17].",
                "Most work on prediction has focused on the traditional ad-hoc retrieval task where query performance is measured according to topical relevance.",
                "These prediction models are evaluated on TREC document collections which typically consist of no more than one million relatively homogenous newswire articles.",
                "With the popularity and influence of the Web, prediction techniques that will work well for web-style queries are highly preferable.",
                "However, web search environments pose significant challenges to current prediction models that are mainly designed for traditional TREC settings.",
                "Here we outline some of these challenges.",
                "First, web collections, which are much larger than conventional TREC collections, include a variety of documents that are different in many aspects such as quality and style.",
                "Current prediction techniques can be vulnerable to these characteristics of web collections.",
                "For example, the reported prediction accuracy of the ranking robustness technique and the clarity technique on the GOV2 collection (a large web collection) is significantly worse compared to the other TREC collections [1].",
                "Similar prediction accuracy on the GOV2 collection using another technique is reported in [2], confirming the difficult of predicting query performance on a large web collection.",
                "Furthermore, web search goes beyond the scope of the ad-hoc retrieval task based on topical relevance.",
                "For example, the Named-Page (NP) finding task, which is a navigational task, is also popular in web retrieval.",
                "Query performance prediction for the NP task is still necessary since NP retrieval performance is far from perfect.",
                "In fact, according to the report on the NP task of the 2005 Terabyte Track [3], about 40% of the test queries perform poorly (no correct answer in the first 10 search results) even in the best run from the top group.",
                "To our knowledge, little research has explicitly addressed the problem of NP-query performance prediction.",
                "Current prediction models devised for content-based queries will be less effective for NP queries considering the fundamental differences between the two.",
                "Third, in real-world web search environments, user queries are usually a mixture of different types and prior knowledge about the type of each query is generally unavailable.",
                "The mixed-query situation raises new problems for query performance prediction.",
                "For instance, we may need to incorporate a query classifier into prediction models.",

(2) new techniques for successfully predicting NP-query performance. (3) a practical and fully automatic solution to predicting mixed-query performance.",

                "Next we review some representative models.",
                "The major difficulty of performance prediction comes from the fact that many factors have an impact on retrieval performance.",
                "Each factor affects performance to a different degree and the overall effect is hard to predict accurately.",
                "Therefore, it is not surprising to notice that simple features, such as the frequency of query terms in the collection [4] and the average IDF of query terms [5], do not predict well.",
                "In fact, most of the successful techniques are based on measuring some characteristics of the retrieved document set to estimate topic difficulty.",
                "For example, the clarity score [6] measures the coherence of a list of documents by the KL-divergence between the query model and the collection model.",

                "Carmel et al. [2] found that the distance measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the retrieved document set and the collection is significantly correlated to average precision.",
                "Vinay et al. [7] proposed four measures to capture the geometry of the top retrieved documents for prediction.",
                "The most effective measure is the sensitivity to document perturbation, an idea somewhat similar to the robustness score.",
                "Unfortunately, their way of measuring the sensitivity does not perform equally well for short queries and prediction accuracy drops considerably when a state-of-the-art retrieval technique (like Okapi or a language modeling approach) is adopted for retrieval instead of the tf-idf weighting used in their paper [16].",
                "The difficulties of applying these models in web search environments have already been mentioned.",
                "In this paper, we mainly adopt the clarity score and the robustness score as our baselines.",
                "We experimentally show that the baselines, even after being carefully tuned, are inadequate for the web environment.",
                "One of our prediction models, WIG, is related to the Markov random field (MRF) model for information retrieval [8].",
                "The MRF model directly models term dependence and is found be to highly effective across a variety of test collections (particularly web collections) and retrieval tasks.",

                "The superiority of WIG over other prediction techniques based on unigram features, which will be demonstrated later in our paper, coincides with that of MRF for retrieval.",
                "In other word, it is interesting to note that term dependence, when being modeled appropriately, can be helpful for both improving and predicting retrieval performance. 3.",
                "PREDICTION MODELS 3.1 Weighted Information Gain (WIG) This section introduces a weighted information gain approach that incorporates both single term and proximity features for predicting performance for both content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries.",
                "Given a set of queries Q={Qs} (s=1,2,..N) which includes all possible user queries and a set of documents D={Dt} (t=1,2…M), we assume that each query-document pair (Qs,Dt) is manually judged and will be put in a relevance list if Qs is found to be relevant to Dt.",

                "To mitigate this problem, we come up with a background distribution P(Qs,C) over Q and D by imagining that every document in D is replaced by the same special document C which represents average language usage.",
                "In this paper, C is created by concatenating every document in D. Roughly speaking, C is the collection (the document set) {Dt} without document boundaries.",

                "Based on the type (or the predicted type) of Qi, the calculation of WIG in Eq. 8 differs in two aspects: (1) how to estimate P(ξ|Dt) and P(ξ|C), and (2) how to choose K. For content-based queries, P(ξ|C) is estimated by the relative frequency of feature ξ in collection C as a whole.",
                "The estimation of P(ξ|Dt) is the same as in [8].",

                "Note that K is the only free parameter in the computation of WIG for content-based queries because all parameters involved in P(ξ|Dt) are assumed to be fixed by taking the suggested values in [8].",
                "Regarding NP queries, we make use of document structure to estimate P(ξ|Dt) and P(ξ|C) by the so-called mixture of language models proposed in [10] and incorporated into the MRF model for Named-Page finding retrieval in [9].",

                "After going through the channel, Q becomes corrupted and is transformed to ranked list L. By thinking about the retrieval process this way, the problem of predicting retrieval effectiveness turns to the task of evaluating the quality of the channel.",
                "In other words, prediction becomes finding a way to measure the degree of corruption that arises when Q is transformed to L. As directly computing the degree of the corruption is difficult, we tackle this problem by approximation.",
                "Our main idea is that we measure to what extent information on Q can be recovered from L on the assumption that only L is observed.",
                "Specifically, we design a decoder that can accurately translate L back into new query Q and the similarity S between the original query Q and the new query Q is adopted as a performance predictor.",
                "This is a sketch of how the QF technique predicts query performance.",
                "Before filling in more details, we briefly discuss why this method would work.",
                "There is a relation between the similarity S defined above and retrieval performance.",
                "On the one hand, if the retrieval has strayed from the original sense of the query Q, the new query Q extracted from ranked list L in response to Q would be very different from the original query Q.",
                "On the other hand, a query distilled from a ranked list containing many relevant documents is likely to be similar to the original query.",
                "Further examples in support of the relation will be provided later.",
                "Next we detail how to build the decoder and how to measure the similarity S. In essence, the goal of the decoder is to compress ranked list L into a few informative terms that should represent the content of the top ranked documents in L. Our approach to this goal is to represent ranked list L by a language model (distribution over terms).",
                "Then terms are ranked by their contribution to the language models KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence from the background collection model.",
                "Top ranked terms will be chosen to form the new query Q.",
                "This approach is similar to that used in Section 4.1 of [11].",
                "Specifically, we take three steps to compress ranked list L into query Q without referring to the original query. 1.",
                "We adopt the ranked list language model [14], to estimate a language model based on ranked list L. The model can be written as: )9()|()|()|( ∑∈ = LD LDPDwPLwP where w is any term, D is a document.",

                "The top N ranked terms by Eq.10 form a weighted query Q={(wi,ti)} i=1,N. where wi denotes the i-th ranked term and weight ti is the KL-divergence contribution of wi in Eq. 10.",

                "We consider two cases: (1) CB: all 150 title queries from the ad-hoc task of the Terabyte Tracks 2004-2006 (2)NP: all 433 NP queries from the named page finding task of the Terabyte Tracks 2005 and 2006.",
                "We take a simple strategy by labeling all of the queries in each case as the same type (either NP or CB) regardless of their actual type.",
                "The computation of WIG will be based on the labeled query type instead of the actual type.",
                "There are four possibilities with respect to the relation between the actual type and the labeled type.",
                "The correlation with retrieval performance under the four possibilities is presented in Table 7.",
                "For example, the value 0.445 at the intersection between the second row and the third column shows the Pearsons correlation coefficient for correlation with average precision when the content-based queries are incorrectly labeled as the NP type.",
                "Based on these results, we recommend treating all queries as the NP type when only one query type exists and accurate query classification is not feasible, considering the risk that a large loss of accuracy will occur if NP queries are incorrectly labeled as content-based queries.",
                "These results also demonstrate the strong adaptability of WIG to different query types.",

                "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet.",
                "We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types).",
                "This is a challenging task because both the predicted and actual performance for one type of query can be incomparable to that for the other type.",
                "Next we discuss how to implement our evaluation.",
                "We create a query pool which consists of all of the 150 ad-hoc title queries from Terabyte Track 2004-2006 and all of the 433 NP queries from Terabyte Track 2005&2006.",
                "We divide the queries in the pool into classes: good (better than 50% of the queries of the same type in terms of retrieval performance) and bad (otherwise).",
                "According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a content-based query with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good.",
                "Then, each time we randomly select one query Q from the pool with probability p that Q is contented-based.",
                "The remaining queries are used as training data.",
                "We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier.",
                "Namely, the query classifier tells us whether query Q is NP or content-based.",
                "Based on the predicted query type and the score computed for query Q by a prediction technique, a binary decision is made about whether query Q is good or bad by comparing to the score threshold of the predicted query type obtained from the training data.",
                "Prediction accuracy is measured by the accuracy of the binary decision.",
                "In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad).",
                "It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy.",
                "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
                "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",
                "When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold.",

                "This strategy represents the level of prediction accuracy that current prediction techniques can achieve in an ideal condition that query types are known.",
                "In the next following three strategies, the WIG method is adopted for performance prediction.",
                "The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",
                "These three strategies are denoted by WIG-1, WIG-2 and WIG-3 respectively.",
                "The reason we are interested in WIG-1 is based on the results from section 4.3.1.",
                "In the last strategy (denoted by Optimal) which serves as an upper bound on how well we can do so far, we fully make use of our prediction techniques for each query type assuming a perfect query classifier is available.",
                "Specifically, we linearly combine WIG and QF for content-based queries and WIG and FRC for NP queries.",
                "The results for the five strategies are shown in Table 8.",
                "For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
                "From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.",
                "Some further improvements over WIG-3 are observed when combined with other prediction techniques.",
                "The merit of WIG-2 is that it provides a practical solution to automatically identifying poorly performing queries in a Web search environment with mixed query types, which poses considerable obstacles to traditional prediction techniques. 5.",

                "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.",
                "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.",
                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
                "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
                "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
                "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
                "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",

Bruce Croft Department of Computer Science University of Massachusetts, Amherst {yzhou, croft}@cs.umass.edu ABSTRACT Current prediction techniques, which are generally designed for content-based queries and are typically evaluated on relatively homogenous test collections of small sizes, face serious challenges in web search environments where collections are significantly more heterogeneous and different types of retrieval tasks exist.",
                "In this paper, we present three techniques to address these challenges.",
                "We focus on performance prediction for two types of queries in web search environments: content-based and Named-Page finding.",
                "Our evaluation is mainly performed on the GOV2 collection.",
                "In addition to evaluating our models for the two types of queries separately, we consider a more challenging and realistic situation that the two types of queries are mixed together without prior information on query types.",
                "To assist prediction under the mixed-query situation, a novel query classifier is adopted.",
                "Results show that our prediction of web query performance is substantially more accurate than the current stateof-the-art prediction techniques.",
                "Consequently, our paper provides a practical approach to performance prediction in realworld web settings.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval -Query formulation General Terms Algorithms, Experimentation, Theory 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Query performance prediction has many applications in a variety of information retrieval (IR) areas such as improving retrieval consistency, query refinement, and distributed IR.",
                "The importance of this problem has been recognized by IR researchers and a number of new methods have been proposed for prediction recently [1, 2, 17].",
                "Most work on prediction has focused on the traditional ad-hoc retrieval task where query performance is measured according to topical relevance.",
                "These prediction models are evaluated on TREC document collections which typically consist of no more than one million relatively homogenous newswire articles.",
                "With the popularity and influence of the Web, prediction techniques that will work well for web-style queries are highly preferable.",
                "However, web search environments pose significant challenges to current prediction models that are mainly designed for traditional TREC settings.",
                "Here we outline some of these challenges.",
                "First, web collections, which are much larger than conventional TREC collections, include a variety of documents that are different in many aspects such as quality and style.",
                "Current prediction techniques can be vulnerable to these characteristics of web collections.",
                "For example, the reported prediction accuracy of the <br>ranking robustness technique</br> and the clarity technique on the GOV2 collection (a large web collection) is significantly worse compared to the other TREC collections [1].",
                "Similar prediction accuracy on the GOV2 collection using another technique is reported in [2], confirming the difficult of predicting query performance on a large web collection.",
                "Furthermore, web search goes beyond the scope of the ad-hoc retrieval task based on topical relevance.",
                "For example, the Named-Page (NP) finding task, which is a navigational task, is also popular in web retrieval.",
                "Query performance prediction for the NP task is still necessary since NP retrieval performance is far from perfect.",
                "In fact, according to the report on the NP task of the 2005 Terabyte Track [3], about 40% of the test queries perform poorly (no correct answer in the first 10 search results) even in the best run from the top group.",
                "To our knowledge, little research has explicitly addressed the problem of NP-query performance prediction.",
                "Current prediction models devised for content-based queries will be less effective for NP queries considering the fundamental differences between the two.",
                "Third, in real-world web search environments, user queries are usually a mixture of different types and prior knowledge about the type of each query is generally unavailable.",
                "The mixed-query situation raises new problems for query performance prediction.",
                "For instance, we may need to incorporate a query classifier into prediction models.",
                "Despite these problems, the ability to handle this situation is a crucial step towards turning query performance prediction from an interesting research topic into a practical tool for web retrieval.",
                "In this paper, we present three techniques to address the above challenges that current prediction models face in Web search environments.",
                "Our work focuses on query performance prediction for the content-based (ad-hoc) retrieval task and the name-page finding task in the context of web retrieval.",
                "Our first technique, called weighted information gain (WIG), makes use of both single term and term proximity features to estimate the quality of top retrieved documents for prediction.",
                "We find that WIG offers consistent prediction accuracy across various test collections and query types.",
                "Moreover, we demonstrate that good prediction accuracy can be achieved for the mixed-query situation by using WIG with the help of a query type classifier.",

(2) new techniques for successfully predicting NP-query performance. (3) a practical and fully automatic solution to predicting mixed-query performance.",
                "In addition, one minor contribution is that we find that the robustness score [1], which was originally proposed for performance prediction, is helpful for query classification. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK As we mentioned in the introduction, a number of prediction techniques have been proposed recently that focus on contentbased queries in the topical relevance (ad-hoc) task.",
                "We know of no published work that addresses other types of queries such as NP queries, let alone a mixture of query types.",
                "Next we review some representative models.",
                "The major difficulty of performance prediction comes from the fact that many factors have an impact on retrieval performance.",
                "Each factor affects performance to a different degree and the overall effect is hard to predict accurately.",
                "Therefore, it is not surprising to notice that simple features, such as the frequency of query terms in the collection [4] and the average IDF of query terms [5], do not predict well.",
                "In fact, most of the successful techniques are based on measuring some characteristics of the retrieved document set to estimate topic difficulty.",
                "For example, the clarity score [6] measures the coherence of a list of documents by the KL-divergence between the query model and the collection model.",
                "The robustness score [1] quantifies another property of a ranked list: the robustness of the ranking in the presence of uncertainty.",
                "Carmel et al. [2] found that the distance measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the retrieved document set and the collection is significantly correlated to average precision.",
                "Vinay et al. [7] proposed four measures to capture the geometry of the top retrieved documents for prediction.",
                "The most effective measure is the sensitivity to document perturbation, an idea somewhat similar to the robustness score.",
                "Unfortunately, their way of measuring the sensitivity does not perform equally well for short queries and prediction accuracy drops considerably when a state-of-the-art retrieval technique (like Okapi or a language modeling approach) is adopted for retrieval instead of the tf-idf weighting used in their paper [16].",
                "The difficulties of applying these models in web search environments have already been mentioned.",
                "In this paper, we mainly adopt the clarity score and the robustness score as our baselines.",
                "We experimentally show that the baselines, even after being carefully tuned, are inadequate for the web environment.",
                "One of our prediction models, WIG, is related to the Markov random field (MRF) model for information retrieval [8].",
                "The MRF model directly models term dependence and is found be to highly effective across a variety of test collections (particularly web collections) and retrieval tasks.",
                "This model is used to estimate the joint probability distribution over documents and queries, an important part of WIG.",
                "The superiority of WIG over other prediction techniques based on unigram features, which will be demonstrated later in our paper, coincides with that of MRF for retrieval.",
                "In other word, it is interesting to note that term dependence, when being modeled appropriately, can be helpful for both improving and predicting retrieval performance. 3.",
                "PREDICTION MODELS 3.1 Weighted Information Gain (WIG) This section introduces a weighted information gain approach that incorporates both single term and proximity features for predicting performance for both content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries.",
                "Given a set of queries Q={Qs} (s=1,2,..N) which includes all possible user queries and a set of documents D={Dt} (t=1,2…M), we assume that each query-document pair (Qs,Dt) is manually judged and will be put in a relevance list if Qs is found to be relevant to Dt.",
                "The joint probability P(Qs,Dt) over queries Q and documents D denotes the probability that pair (Qs,Dt) will be in the relevance list.",
                "Such assumptions are similar to those used in [8].",
                "Assuming that the user issues query Qi ∈Q and the retrieval results in response to Qi is a ranked list L of documents, we calculate the amount of information contained in P(Qs,Dt) with respect to Qi and L by Eq.1 which is a variant of entropy called the weighted entropy[13].",

                "To mitigate this problem, we come up with a background distribution P(Qs,C) over Q and D by imagining that every document in D is replaced by the same special document C which represents average language usage.",
                "In this paper, C is created by concatenating every document in D. Roughly speaking, C is the collection (the document set) {Dt} without document boundaries.",
                "Similarly, weighted entropy ),(, CQH sLQi calculated by Eq.3 represents the amount of information about how likely an average document (represented by the whole collection) would be relevant to query Qi.",

                "We hypothesize that WIG is positively correlated with retrieval effectiveness because high quality retrieval should be much more effective than just returning the average document.",
                "The heart of this technique is how to estimate the joint distribution P(Qs,Dt).",
                "In the language modeling approach to IR, a variety of models can be applied readily to estimate this distribution.",
                "Although most of these models are based on the bagof-words assumption, recent work on modeling term dependence under the language modeling framework have shown consistent and significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over bagof-words models.",
                "Inspired by the success of incorporating term proximity features into language models, we decide to adopt a good dependence model to estimate the probability P(Qs,Dt).",
                "The model we chose for this paper is Metzler and Crofts Markov Random Field (MRF) model, which has already demonstrated superiority over a number of collections and different retrieval tasks [8,9].",

                "The other role, which is specific to our prediction task, is to normalize the size of F(Qi).We found that the following weight strategy for λξ satisfies the above two roles and generalizes well on a variety of collections and query types. )6( )(, |)(| 1 )(, |)(| ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎧ ∈ − ∈ = i i T i i T QP QP QT QT ξ λ ξ λ λξ where |T(Qi)| and |P(Qi)| denote the number of single term and proximity features in F(Qi) respectively.",

                "Based on the type (or the predicted type) of Qi, the calculation of WIG in Eq. 8 differs in two aspects: (1) how to estimate P(ξ|Dt) and P(ξ|C), and (2) how to choose K. For content-based queries, P(ξ|C) is estimated by the relative frequency of feature ξ in collection C as a whole.",
                "The estimation of P(ξ|Dt) is the same as in [8].",
                "Namely, we estimate P(ξ|Dt) by the relative frequency of feature ξ in Dt linearly smoothed with collection frequency P(ξ|C).",
                "K in Eq.8 is treated as a free parameter.",
                "Note that K is the only free parameter in the computation of WIG for content-based queries because all parameters involved in P(ξ|Dt) are assumed to be fixed by taking the suggested values in [8].",
                "Regarding NP queries, we make use of document structure to estimate P(ξ|Dt) and P(ξ|C) by the so-called mixture of language models proposed in [10] and incorporated into the MRF model for Named-Page finding retrieval in [9].",
                "The basic idea is that a document (collection) is divided into several fields such as the title field, the main-body field and the heading field.",
                "P(ξ|Dt) and P(ξ|C) are estimated by a linear combination of the language models from each field.",
                "Due to space constraints, we refer the reader to [9] for details.",
                "We adopt the exact same set of parameters as used in [9] for estimation.",
                "With regard to K in Eq.8, we set K to 1 because the Named-Page finding task heavily focuses on the first ranked document.",
                "Consequently, there are no free parameters in the computation of WIG for NP queries. 3.2 Query Feedback In this section, we introduce another technique called query feedback (QF) for prediction.",
                "Suppose that a user issues query Q to a retrieval system and a ranked list L of documents is returned.",
                "We view the retrieval system as a noisy channel.",
                "Specifically, we assume that the output of the channel is L and the input is Q.",
                "After going through the channel, Q becomes corrupted and is transformed to ranked list L. By thinking about the retrieval process this way, the problem of predicting retrieval effectiveness turns to the task of evaluating the quality of the channel.",
                "In other words, prediction becomes finding a way to measure the degree of corruption that arises when Q is transformed to L. As directly computing the degree of the corruption is difficult, we tackle this problem by approximation.",
                "Our main idea is that we measure to what extent information on Q can be recovered from L on the assumption that only L is observed.",
                "Specifically, we design a decoder that can accurately translate L back into new query Q and the similarity S between the original query Q and the new query Q is adopted as a performance predictor.",
                "This is a sketch of how the QF technique predicts query performance.",
                "Before filling in more details, we briefly discuss why this method would work.",
                "There is a relation between the similarity S defined above and retrieval performance.",
                "On the one hand, if the retrieval has strayed from the original sense of the query Q, the new query Q extracted from ranked list L in response to Q would be very different from the original query Q.",
                "On the other hand, a query distilled from a ranked list containing many relevant documents is likely to be similar to the original query.",
                "Further examples in support of the relation will be provided later.",
                "Next we detail how to build the decoder and how to measure the similarity S. In essence, the goal of the decoder is to compress ranked list L into a few informative terms that should represent the content of the top ranked documents in L. Our approach to this goal is to represent ranked list L by a language model (distribution over terms).",
                "Then terms are ranked by their contribution to the language models KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence from the background collection model.",
                "Top ranked terms will be chosen to form the new query Q.",
                "This approach is similar to that used in Section 4.1 of [11].",
                "Specifically, we take three steps to compress ranked list L into query Q without referring to the original query. 1.",
                "We adopt the ranked list language model [14], to estimate a language model based on ranked list L. The model can be written as: )9()|()|()|( ∑∈ = LD LDPDwPLwP where w is any term, D is a document.",

                "The top N ranked terms by Eq.10 form a weighted query Q={(wi,ti)} i=1,N. where wi denotes the i-th ranked term and weight ti is the KL-divergence contribution of wi in Eq. 10.",

                "The computation of WIG will be based on the labeled query type instead of the actual type.",
                "There are four possibilities with respect to the relation between the actual type and the labeled type.",
                "The correlation with retrieval performance under the four possibilities is presented in Table 7.",
                "For example, the value 0.445 at the intersection between the second row and the third column shows the Pearsons correlation coefficient for correlation with average precision when the content-based queries are incorrectly labeled as the NP type.",

                "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet.",
                "We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types).",
                "This is a challenging task because both the predicted and actual performance for one type of query can be incomparable to that for the other type.",

                "We divide the queries in the pool into classes: good (better than 50% of the queries of the same type in terms of retrieval performance) and bad (otherwise).",
                "According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a content-based query with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good.",
                "Then, each time we randomly select one query Q from the pool with probability p that Q is contented-based.",
                "The remaining queries are used as training data.",
                "We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier.",
                "Namely, the query classifier tells us whether query Q is NP or content-based.",
                "Based on the predicted query type and the score computed for query Q by a prediction technique, a binary decision is made about whether query Q is good or bad by comparing to the score threshold of the predicted query type obtained from the training data.",
                "Prediction accuracy is measured by the accuracy of the binary decision.",
                "In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad).",
                "It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy.",
                "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
                "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",
                "When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold.",

(2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",

                "For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
                "From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.",

                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",

                "Most work on prediction has focused on the traditional ad-hoc retrieval task where query performance is measured according to topical relevance.",

                "With the popularity and influence of the Web, prediction techniques that will work well for web-style queries are highly preferable.",

                "Similar prediction accuracy on the GOV2 collection using another technique is reported in [2], confirming the difficult of predicting query performance on a large web collection.",
                "Furthermore, web search goes beyond the scope of the ad-hoc retrieval task based on topical relevance.",

                "In fact, according to the report on the NP task of the 2005 Terabyte Track [3], about 40% of the test queries perform poorly (no correct answer in the first 10 search results) even in the best run from the top group.",

(2) new techniques for successfully predicting NP-query performance. (3) a practical and fully automatic solution to predicting mixed-query performance.",

                "Therefore, it is not surprising to notice that simple features, such as the frequency of query terms in the collection [4] and the average IDF of query terms [5], do not predict well.",
                "In fact, most of the successful techniques are based on measuring some characteristics of the retrieved document set to estimate topic difficulty.",
                "For example, the clarity score [6] measures the coherence of a list of documents by the KL-divergence between the query model and the collection model.",

                "Our main idea is that we measure to what extent information on Q can be recovered from L on the assumption that only L is observed.",
                "Specifically, we design a decoder that can accurately translate L back into new query Q and the similarity S between the original query Q and the new query Q is adopted as a performance predictor.",

                "Next we detail how to build the decoder and how to measure the similarity S. In essence, the goal of the decoder is to compress ranked list L into a few informative terms that should represent the content of the top ranked documents in L. Our approach to this goal is to represent ranked list L by a language model (distribution over terms).",

                "We take a simple strategy by labeling all of the queries in each case as the same type (either NP or CB) regardless of their actual type.",
                "The computation of WIG will be based on the labeled query type instead of the actual type.",
                "There are four possibilities with respect to the relation between the actual type and the labeled type.",
                "The correlation with retrieval performance under the four possibilities is presented in Table 7.",
                "For example, the value 0.445 at the intersection between the second row and the third column shows the Pearsons correlation coefficient for correlation with average precision when the content-based queries are incorrectly labeled as the NP type.",

                "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet.",
                "We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types).",
                "This is a challenging task because both the predicted and actual performance for one type of query can be incomparable to that for the other type.",

                "We divide the queries in the pool into classes: good (better than 50% of the queries of the same type in terms of retrieval performance) and bad (otherwise).",
                "According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a content-based query with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good.",
                "Then, each time we randomly select one query Q from the pool with probability p that Q is contented-based.",
                "The remaining queries are used as training data.",
                "We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier.",

                "In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad).",
                "It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy.",
                "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
                "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",
                "When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold.",

                "In the next following three strategies, the WIG method is adopted for performance prediction.",
                "The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",

                "For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
                "From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.",

                "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.",
                "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the <br>named-page finding task</br> respectively.",
                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",

                "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",

                "The importance of this problem has been recognized by IR researchers and a number of new methods have been proposed for prediction recently [1, 2, 17].",
                "Most work on prediction has focused on the traditional ad-hoc retrieval task where query performance is measured according to topical relevance.",
                "These prediction models are evaluated on TREC document collections which typically consist of no more than one million relatively homogenous newswire articles.",
                "With the popularity and influence of the Web, prediction techniques that will work well for web-style queries are highly preferable.",
                "However, web search environments pose significant challenges to current prediction models that are mainly designed for traditional TREC settings.",
                "Here we outline some of these challenges.",
                "First, web collections, which are much larger than conventional TREC collections, include a variety of documents that are different in many aspects such as quality and style.",
                "Current prediction techniques can be vulnerable to these characteristics of web collections.",
                "For example, the reported prediction accuracy of the ranking robustness technique and the clarity technique on the GOV2 collection (a large web collection) is significantly worse compared to the other TREC collections [1].",
                "Similar prediction accuracy on the GOV2 collection using another technique is reported in [2], confirming the difficult of predicting query performance on a large web collection.",
                "Furthermore, web search goes beyond the scope of the ad-hoc retrieval task based on topical relevance.",
                "For example, the Named-Page (NP) finding task, which is a navigational task, is also popular in web retrieval.",
                "Query performance prediction for the NP task is still necessary since NP retrieval performance is far from perfect.",
                "In fact, according to the report on the NP task of the 2005 Terabyte Track [3], about 40% of the test queries perform poorly (no correct answer in the first 10 search results) even in the best run from the top group.",

                "Current prediction models devised for content-based queries will be less effective for NP queries considering the fundamental differences between the two.",
                "Third, in real-world web search environments, user queries are usually a mixture of different types and prior knowledge about the type of each query is generally unavailable.",

(2) new techniques for successfully predicting NP-query performance. (3) a practical and fully automatic solution to predicting mixed-query performance.",

                "Therefore, it is not surprising to notice that simple features, such as the frequency of query terms in the collection [4] and the average IDF of query terms [5], do not predict well.",
                "In fact, most of the successful techniques are based on measuring some characteristics of the retrieved document set to estimate topic difficulty.",
                "For example, the clarity score [6] measures the coherence of a list of documents by the KL-divergence between the query model and the collection model.",

                "Carmel et al. [2] found that the distance measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the retrieved document set and the collection is significantly correlated to average precision.",
                "Vinay et al. [7] proposed four measures to capture the geometry of the top retrieved documents for prediction.",
                "The most effective measure is the sensitivity to document perturbation, an idea somewhat similar to the robustness score.",
                "Unfortunately, their way of measuring the sensitivity does not perform equally well for short queries and prediction accuracy drops considerably when a state-of-the-art retrieval technique (like Okapi or a language modeling approach) is adopted for retrieval instead of the tf-idf weighting used in their paper [16].",

                "In this paper, we mainly adopt the clarity score and the robustness score as our baselines.",

For content-based queries, P(ξ|C) is estimated by the relative frequency of feature ξ in collection C as a whole.",
                "The estimation of P(ξ|Dt) is the same as in [8].",

                "After going through the channel, Q becomes corrupted and is transformed to ranked list L. By thinking about the retrieval process this way, the problem of predicting retrieval effectiveness turns to the task of evaluating the quality of the channel.",
                "In other words, prediction becomes finding a way to measure the degree of corruption that arises when Q is transformed to L. As directly computing the degree of the corruption is difficult, we tackle this problem by approximation.",
                "Our main idea is that we measure to what extent information on Q can be recovered from L on the assumption that only L is observed.",
                "Specifically, we design a decoder that can accurately translate L back into new query Q and the similarity S between the original query Q and the new query Q is adopted as a performance predictor.",
                "This is a sketch of how the QF technique predicts query performance.",
                "Before filling in more details, we briefly discuss why this method would work.",
                "There is a relation between the similarity S defined above and retrieval performance.",
                "On the one hand, if the retrieval has strayed from the original sense of the query Q, the new query Q extracted from ranked list L in response to Q would be very different from the original query Q.",
                "On the other hand, a query distilled from a ranked list containing many relevant documents is likely to be similar to the original query.",
                "Further examples in support of the relation will be provided later.",
                "Next we detail how to build the decoder and how to measure the similarity S. In essence, the goal of the decoder is to compress ranked list L into a few informative terms that should represent the content of the top ranked documents in L. Our approach to this goal is to represent ranked list L by a language model (distribution over terms).",
                "Then terms are ranked by their contribution to the language models KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence from the background collection model.",
                "Top ranked terms will be chosen to form the new query Q.",
                "This approach is similar to that used in Section 4.1 of [11].",
                "Specifically, we take three steps to compress ranked list L into query Q without referring to the original query. 1.",
                "We adopt the ranked list language model [14], to estimate a language model based on ranked list L. The model can be written as: )9()|()|()|( ∑∈ = LD LDPDwPLwP where w is any term, D is a document.",

                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.",
                "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.",
                "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.",
                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
                "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
                "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
                "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
                "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",
                "Guided by performance prediction, we can make a better decision on when to or how to modify queries to enhance retrieval effectiveness.",

Bruce Croft Department of Computer Science University of Massachusetts, Amherst {yzhou, croft}@cs.umass.edu ABSTRACT Current prediction techniques, which are generally designed for content-based queries and are typically evaluated on relatively homogenous test collections of small sizes, face serious challenges in web search environments where collections are significantly more heterogeneous and different types of retrieval tasks exist.",

                "The importance of this problem has been recognized by IR researchers and a number of new methods have been proposed for prediction recently [1, 2, 17].",
                "Most work on prediction has focused on the traditional ad-hoc retrieval task where query performance is measured according to topical relevance.",
                "These prediction models are evaluated on TREC document collections which typically consist of no more than one million relatively homogenous newswire articles.",
                "With the popularity and influence of the Web, prediction techniques that will work well for web-style queries are highly preferable.",
                "However, web search environments pose significant challenges to current prediction models that are mainly designed for traditional TREC settings.",
                "Here we outline some of these challenges.",
                "First, web collections, which are much larger than conventional TREC collections, include a variety of documents that are different in many aspects such as quality and style.",
                "Current prediction techniques can be vulnerable to these characteristics of web collections.",
                "For example, the reported prediction accuracy of the ranking robustness technique and the clarity technique on the GOV2 collection (a large web collection) is significantly worse compared to the other TREC collections [1].",
                "Similar prediction accuracy on the GOV2 collection using another technique is reported in [2], confirming the difficult of predicting query performance on a large web collection.",
                "Furthermore, web search goes beyond the scope of the ad-hoc retrieval task based on topical relevance.",
                "For example, the Named-Page (NP) finding task, which is a navigational task, is also popular in web retrieval.",
                "Query performance prediction for the NP task is still necessary since NP retrieval performance is far from perfect.",
                "In fact, according to the report on the NP task of the 2005 Terabyte Track [3], about 40% of the test queries perform poorly (no correct answer in the first 10 search results) even in the best run from the top group.",

                "Current prediction models devised for content-based queries will be less effective for NP queries considering the fundamental differences between the two.",
                "Third, in real-world web search environments, user queries are usually a mixture of different types and prior knowledge about the type of each query is generally unavailable.",

                "Therefore, it is not surprising to notice that simple features, such as the frequency of query terms in the collection [4] and the average IDF of query terms [5], do not predict well.",
                "In fact, most of the successful techniques are based on measuring some characteristics of the retrieved document set to estimate topic difficulty.",
                "For example, the clarity score [6] measures the coherence of a list of documents by the KL-divergence between the query model and the collection model.",

                "The most effective measure is the sensitivity to document perturbation, an idea somewhat similar to the robustness score.",
                "Unfortunately, their way of measuring the sensitivity does not perform equally well for short queries and prediction accuracy drops considerably when a state-of-the-art retrieval technique (like Okapi or a language modeling approach) is adopted for retrieval instead of the tf-idf weighting used in their paper [16].",
                "The difficulties of applying these models in web search environments have already been mentioned.",
                "In this paper, we mainly adopt the clarity score and the robustness score as our baselines.",

                "One of our prediction models, <br>wig</br>, is related to the Markov random field (MRF) model for information retrieval [8].",
                "The MRF model directly models term dependence and is found be to highly effective across a variety of test collections (particularly web collections) and retrieval tasks.",

                "The estimation of P(ξ|Dt) is the same as in [8].",

                "We view the retrieval system as a noisy channel.",
                "Specifically, we assume that the output of the channel is L and the input is Q.",
                "After going through the channel, Q becomes corrupted and is transformed to ranked list L. By thinking about the retrieval process this way, the problem of predicting retrieval effectiveness turns to the task of evaluating the quality of the channel.",
                "In other words, prediction becomes finding a way to measure the degree of corruption that arises when Q is transformed to L. As directly computing the degree of the corruption is difficult, we tackle this problem by approximation.",
                "Our main idea is that we measure to what extent information on Q can be recovered from L on the assumption that only L is observed.",

                "Before filling in more details, we briefly discuss why this method would work.",
                "There is a relation between the similarity S defined above and retrieval performance.",
                "On the one hand, if the retrieval has strayed from the original sense of the query Q, the new query Q extracted from ranked list L in response to Q would be very different from the original query Q.",
                "On the other hand, a query distilled from a ranked list containing many relevant documents is likely to be similar to the original query.",
                "Further examples in support of the relation will be provided later.",
                "Next we detail how to build the decoder and how to measure the similarity S. In essence, the goal of the decoder is to compress ranked list L into a few informative terms that should represent the content of the top ranked documents in L. Our approach to this goal is to represent ranked list L by a language model (distribution over terms).",

                "Specifically, we take three steps to compress ranked list L into query Q without referring to the original query. 1.",
                "We adopt the ranked list language model [14], to estimate a language model based on ranked list L. The model can be written as: )9()|()|()|( ∑∈ = LD LDPDwPLwP where w is any term, D is a document.",

                "The top N ranked terms by Eq.10 form a weighted query Q={(wi,ti)} i=1,N. where wi denotes the i-th ranked term and weight ti is the KL-divergence contribution of wi in Eq. 10.",

                "When directly applied to NP queries, the robustness technique will be less effective because it takes the top ranked documents as a whole into account while NP queries usually have only one single relevant document.",

                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
                "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
                "We demonstrated that the <br>wig</br> method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of <br>wig</br> to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the <br>wig</br> score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
                "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
                "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",

                "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet.",
                "We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types).",
                "This is a challenging task because both the predicted and actual performance for one type of query can be incomparable to that for the other type.",

                "According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a content-based query with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good.",
                "Then, each time we randomly select one query Q from the pool with probability p that Q is contented-based.",
                "The remaining queries are used as training data.",
                "We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier.",

                "In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad).",
                "It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy.",
                "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
                "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",
                "When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold.",
                "Similar procedures will be taken for other prediction techniques.",

                "This strategy represents the level of prediction accuracy that current prediction techniques can achieve in an ideal condition that query types are known.",
                "In the next following three strategies, the WIG method is adopted for performance prediction.",
                "The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the <br>robustness score probabilitydensity classifier</br> is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",
                "These three strategies are denoted by WIG-1, WIG-2 and WIG-3 respectively.",
                "The reason we are interested in WIG-1 is based on the results from section 4.3.1.",
                "In the last strategy (denoted by Optimal) which serves as an upper bound on how well we can do so far, we fully make use of our prediction techniques for each query type assuming a perfect query classifier is available.",
                "Specifically, we linearly combine WIG and QF for content-based queries and WIG and FRC for NP queries.",
                "The results for the five strategies are shown in Table 8.",
                "For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
                "From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.",
                "Some further improvements over WIG-3 are observed when combined with other prediction techniques.",
                "The merit of WIG-2 is that it provides a practical solution to automatically identifying poorly performing queries in a Web search environment with mixed query types, which poses considerable obstacles to traditional prediction techniques. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.",
                "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.",
                "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.",
                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
                "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
                "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
                "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
                "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",

                "Next we detail how to build the decoder and how to measure the similarity S. In essence, the goal of the decoder is to compress ranked list L into a few informative terms that should represent the content of the top ranked documents in L. Our approach to this goal is to represent ranked list L by a language model (distribution over terms).",

                "We believe that this is the main reason for the low accuracy of the clarity score on the second data set.",

                "We consider two cases: (1) CB: all 150 title queries from the ad-hoc task of the Terabyte Tracks 2004-2006 (2)NP: all 433 NP queries from the named page finding task of the Terabyte Tracks 2005 and 2006.",
                "We take a simple strategy by labeling all of the queries in each case as the same type (either NP or CB) regardless of their actual type.",
                "The computation of WIG will be based on the labeled query type instead of the actual type.",
                "There are four possibilities with respect to the relation between the actual type and the labeled type.",
                "The correlation with retrieval performance under the four possibilities is presented in Table 7.",
                "For example, the value 0.445 at the intersection between the second row and the third column shows the Pearsons correlation coefficient for correlation with average precision when the content-based queries are incorrectly labeled as the NP type.",

                "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet.",
                "We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types).",
                "This is a challenging task because both the predicted and actual performance for one type of query can be incomparable to that for the other type.",
                "Next we discuss how to implement our evaluation.",
                "We create a query pool which consists of all of the 150 ad-hoc title queries from Terabyte Track 2004-2006 and all of the 433 NP queries from Terabyte Track 2005&2006.",
                "We divide the queries in the pool into classes: good (better than 50% of the queries of the same type in terms of retrieval performance) and bad (otherwise).",
                "According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a content-based query with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good.",
                "Then, each time we randomly select one query Q from the pool with probability p that Q is contented-based.",
                "The remaining queries are used as training data.",
                "We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier.",
                "Namely, the query classifier tells us whether query Q is NP or content-based.",
                "Based on the predicted query type and the score computed for query Q by a prediction technique, a binary decision is made about whether query Q is good or bad by comparing to the score threshold of the predicted query type obtained from the training data.",
                "Prediction accuracy is measured by the accuracy of the binary decision.",
                "In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad).",
                "It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy.",
                "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
                "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",
                "When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold.",
                "Similar procedures will be taken for other prediction techniques.",
                "Now we briefly introduce the automatic query type classifier used in this paper.",

                "In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB).",
                "This strategy represents the level of prediction accuracy that current prediction techniques can achieve in an ideal condition that query types are known.",
                "In the next following three strategies, the WIG method is adopted for performance prediction.",
                "The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",
                "These three strategies are denoted by WIG-1, WIG-2 and WIG-3 respectively.",
                "The reason we are interested in WIG-1 is based on the results from section 4.3.1.",
                "In the last strategy (denoted by Optimal) which serves as an upper bound on how well we can do so far, we fully make use of our prediction techniques for each query type assuming a perfect query classifier is available.",
                "Specifically, we linearly combine WIG and QF for content-based queries and WIG and FRC for NP queries.",
                "The results for the five strategies are shown in Table 8.",
                "For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
                "From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.",
                "Some further improvements over WIG-3 are observed when combined with other prediction techniques.",
                "The merit of WIG-2 is that it provides a practical solution to automatically identifying poorly performing queries in a Web search environment with mixed query types, which poses considerable obstacles to traditional prediction techniques. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.",
                "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.",
                "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.",
                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
                "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
                "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
                "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
                "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",
                "Guided by performance prediction, we can make a better decision on when to or how to modify queries to enhance retrieval effectiveness.",

(2) new techniques for successfully predicting NP-query performance. (3) a practical and fully automatic solution to predicting mixed-query performance.",

                "Therefore, it is not surprising to notice that simple features, such as the frequency of query terms in the collection [4] and the average IDF of query terms [5], do not predict well.",
                "In fact, most of the successful techniques are based on measuring some characteristics of the retrieved document set to estimate topic difficulty.",
                "For example, the clarity score [6] measures the coherence of a list of documents by the KL-divergence between the query model and the collection model.",

                "The most effective measure is the sensitivity to document perturbation, an idea somewhat similar to the robustness score.",
                "Unfortunately, their way of measuring the sensitivity does not perform equally well for short queries and prediction accuracy drops considerably when a state-of-the-art retrieval technique (like Okapi or a language modeling approach) is adopted for retrieval instead of the tf-idf weighting used in their paper [16].",
                "The difficulties of applying these models in web search environments have already been mentioned.",
                "In this paper, we mainly adopt the clarity score and the robustness score as our baselines.",
                "We experimentally show that the baselines, even after being carefully tuned, are inadequate for the web environment.",
                "One of our prediction models, WIG, is related to the Markov random field (MRF) model for information retrieval [8].",

                "Our main idea is that we measure to what extent information on Q can be recovered from L on the assumption that only L is observed.",

                "On the other hand, a query distilled from a ranked list containing many relevant documents is likely to be similar to the original query.",
                "Further examples in support of the relation will be provided later.",
                "Next we detail how to build the decoder and how to measure the similarity S. In essence, the goal of the decoder is to compress ranked list L into a few informative terms that should represent the content of the top ranked documents in L. Our approach to this goal is to represent ranked list L by a language model (distribution over terms).",
                "Then terms are ranked by their contribution to the language models KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence from the background collection model.",
                "Top ranked terms will be chosen to form the new query Q.",
                "This approach is similar to that used in Section 4.1 of [11].",
                "Specifically, we take three steps to compress ranked list L into query Q without referring to the original query. 1.",
                "We adopt the ranked list language model [14], to estimate a language model based on ranked list L. The model can be written as: )9()|()|()|( ∑∈ = LD LDPDwPLwP where w is any term, D is a document.",

                "The top N ranked terms by Eq.10 form a weighted query Q={(wi,ti)} i=1,N. where wi denotes the i-th ranked term and weight ti is the KL-divergence contribution of wi in Eq. 10.",

                "This method is derived from the ranking robustness technique [1] that is mainly designed for content-based queries.",
                "When directly applied to NP queries, the robustness technique will be less effective because it takes the top ranked documents as a whole into account while NP queries usually have only one single relevant document.",
                "Instead, our technique focuses on the first rank document while the main idea of the robustness method remains.",
                "Specifically, the pseudocode for computing FRC is shown in figure 1.",

                "We take a simple strategy by labeling all of the queries in each case as the same type (either NP or CB) regardless of their actual type.",
                "The computation of WIG will be based on the labeled query type instead of the actual type.",
                "There are four possibilities with respect to the relation between the actual type and the labeled type.",
                "The correlation with retrieval performance under the four possibilities is presented in Table 7.",
                "For example, the value 0.445 at the intersection between the second row and the third column shows the Pearsons correlation coefficient for correlation with average precision when the content-based queries are incorrectly labeled as the NP type.",

                "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a Web search engine will meet.",
                "We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types).",
                "This is a challenging task because both the predicted and actual performance for one type of query can be incomparable to that for the other type.",
                "Next we discuss how to implement our evaluation.",
                "We create a query pool which consists of all of the 150 ad-hoc title queries from Terabyte Track 2004-2006 and all of the 433 NP queries from Terabyte Track 2005&2006.",
                "We divide the queries in the pool into classes: good (better than 50% of the queries of the same type in terms of retrieval performance) and bad (otherwise).",
                "According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a content-based query with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good.",
                "Then, each time we randomly select one query Q from the pool with probability p that Q is contented-based.",
                "The remaining queries are used as training data.",
                "We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier.",
                "Namely, the query classifier tells us whether query Q is NP or content-based.",
                "Based on the predicted query type and the score computed for query Q by a prediction technique, a binary decision is made about whether query Q is good or bad by comparing to the score threshold of the predicted query type obtained from the training data.",
                "Prediction accuracy is measured by the accuracy of the binary decision.",
                "In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad).",
                "It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy.",
                "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
                "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",
                "When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold.",

                "In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB).",
                "This strategy represents the level of prediction accuracy that current prediction techniques can achieve in an ideal condition that query types are known.",
                "In the next following three strategies, the WIG method is adopted for performance prediction.",
                "The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",
                "These three strategies are denoted by WIG-1, WIG-2 and WIG-3 respectively.",
                "The reason we are interested in WIG-1 is based on the results from section 4.3.1.",
                "In the last strategy (denoted by Optimal) which serves as an upper bound on how well we can do so far, we fully make use of our prediction techniques for each query type assuming a perfect query classifier is available.",
                "Specifically, we linearly combine WIG and QF for content-based queries and WIG and FRC for NP queries.",
                "The results for the five strategies are shown in Table 8.",
                "For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
                "From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.",
                "Some further improvements over WIG-3 are observed when combined with other prediction techniques.",
                "The merit of WIG-2 is that it provides a practical solution to automatically identifying poorly performing queries in a Web search environment with mixed query types, which poses considerable obstacles to traditional prediction techniques. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.",
                "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.",
                "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.",
                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
                "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
                "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
                "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
                "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",

                "We consider two cases: (1) CB: all 150 title queries from the ad-hoc task of the Terabyte Tracks 2004-2006 (2)NP: all 433 NP queries from the named page finding task of the Terabyte Tracks 2005 and 2006.",
                "We take a simple strategy by labeling all of the queries in each case as the same type (either NP or CB) regardless of their actual type.",
                "The computation of WIG will be based on the labeled query type instead of the actual type.",
                "There are four possibilities with respect to the relation between the actual type and the labeled type.",
                "The correlation with retrieval performance under the four possibilities is presented in Table 7.",
                "For example, the value 0.445 at the intersection between the second row and the third column shows the Pearsons correlation coefficient for correlation with average precision when the content-based queries are incorrectly labeled as the NP type.",
                "Based on these results, we recommend treating all queries as the NP type when only one query type exists and accurate query classification is not feasible, considering the risk that a large loss of accuracy will occur if NP queries are incorrectly labeled as content-based queries.",

                "Bold cases mean the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. 4.3.2 A mixture of contented-based and NP queries A mixture of the two types of queries is a more realistic situation that a <br>web search</br> engine will meet.",
                "We evaluate prediction accuracy by how accurately poorly-performing queries can be identified by the prediction method assuming that actual query types are unknown (but we can predict query types).",
                "This is a challenging task because both the predicted and actual performance for one type of query can be incomparable to that for the other type.",

                "We create a query pool which consists of all of the 150 ad-hoc title queries from Terabyte Track 2004-2006 and all of the 433 NP queries from Terabyte Track 2005&2006.",

                "According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a content-based query with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good.",
                "Then, each time we randomly select one query Q from the pool with probability p that Q is contented-based.",
                "The remaining queries are used as training data.",
                "We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier.",
                "Namely, the query classifier tells us whether query Q is NP or content-based.",
                "Based on the predicted query type and the score computed for query Q by a prediction technique, a binary decision is made about whether query Q is good or bad by comparing to the score threshold of the predicted query type obtained from the training data.",
                "Prediction accuracy is measured by the accuracy of the binary decision.",
                "In our implementation, we repeatedly take a test query from the query pool and prediction accuracy is computed as the percentage of correct decisions, that is, a good(bad) query is predicted to be good (bad).",
                "It is obvious that random guessing will lead to 50% accuracy.",
                "Let us take the WIG method for example to illustrate the process.",
                "Two WIG thresholds (one for NP queries and the other for content-based queries) are trained by maximizing the prediction accuracy on the training data.",
                "When a test query is labeled as the NP (CB) type by the query type classifier, it will be predicted to be good if and only if the WIG score for this query is above the NP (CB) threshold.",
                "Similar procedures will be taken for other prediction techniques.",

                "We find that the robustness score, though originally proposed for performance prediction, is a good indicator of query types.",
                "We find that on average content-based queries have a much higher robustness score than NP queries.",
                "For example, Figure 2 shows the distributions of robustness scores for NP and content-based queries.",

                "We consider five strategies in our experiments.",
                "In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB).",
                "This strategy represents the level of prediction accuracy that current prediction techniques can achieve in an ideal condition that query types are known.",
                "In the next following three strategies, the WIG method is adopted for performance prediction.",
                "The difference among the three is that three different query classifiers are used for each strategy: (1) the classifier always classifies a query into the NP type. (2) the Robustness Score ProbabilityDensity classifier is the robust score classifier mentioned above. (3) the classifier is a perfect one.",
                "These three strategies are denoted by WIG-1, WIG-2 and WIG-3 respectively.",
                "The reason we are interested in WIG-1 is based on the results from section 4.3.1.",
                "In the last strategy (denoted by Optimal) which serves as an upper bound on how well we can do so far, we fully make use of our prediction techniques for each query type assuming a perfect query classifier is available.",
                "Specifically, we linearly combine WIG and QF for content-based queries and WIG and FRC for NP queries.",
                "The results for the five strategies are shown in Table 8.",
                "For each strategy, we try two ways to sample a query from the pool: (1) the sampled query is CB with probability p=0.6. (the query is NP with probability 0.4) (2) set the probability p=0.4.",
                "From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.",
                "Some further improvements over WIG-3 are observed when combined with other prediction techniques.",
                "The merit of WIG-2 is that it provides a practical solution to automatically identifying poorly performing queries in a <br>web search</br> environment with mixed query types, which poses considerable obstacles to traditional prediction techniques. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in <br>web search</br> environments.",
                "We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for <br>web search</br> scenarios.",
                "In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in <br>web search</br>: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.",
                "For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.",
                "Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.",
                "We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.",
                "Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.",
                "Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.",
                "Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.",
                "On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.",
                "How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.",
                "In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.",
                "For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.",
                "Guided by performance prediction, we can make a better decision on when to or how to modify queries to enhance retrieval effectiveness.",
