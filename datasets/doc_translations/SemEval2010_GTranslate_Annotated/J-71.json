Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM). A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both. Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution. The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share. The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand. Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in. I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.

INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events. The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM). The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker. Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism. Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct. Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets. These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting. Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders. A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution. But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin. A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders. A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses. Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available. As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well. Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker. Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers. However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close. For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information. Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed. Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings. In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM). A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA. A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk). A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market. The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation. A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution. A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA. The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering. If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases. Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired. The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs. DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed. While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism. Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games. In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future. After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered. More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered. That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered. An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars. In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet. Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B. The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B. Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race). People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total. People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees). Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25. Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed. The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome. As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available. Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen. Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes. So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates. This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed. Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close. However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM. If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1. Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss. Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying. A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker. In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk. The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time. It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios. There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high). Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging. Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics. But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market. Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market. This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market. In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17]. A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common. The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA). The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible. Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16]. Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes. So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs. In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur. Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down. In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14]. Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19]. A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell. If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask). If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur. In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset. Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk. However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade. As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs. The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices. We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades. The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm. Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk. Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA. In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes. Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet. The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread. While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM. One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker. Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand. Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk. Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM. Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price. An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market. The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded. An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events. At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution. In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution. In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate. Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity. An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system. An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker. In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close. While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar. Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes. The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently. The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3. A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase. So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A. A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other. Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur. The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome. There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds. For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward. Denote the two outcomes A and B. The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive. Denote the instantaneous price per share of A as p1 and the price per share of B as p2. Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively. These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand. Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed. At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B). However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each. These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2. For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation. Denote M1 as the total amount of money wagered on A, M2 as the total amount of money wagered on B, T = M1 + M2 as the total amount of money wagered on both sides, N1 as the total number of shares purchased of A, and N2 as the total number of shares purchased of B. There are many ways to formulate the price function. Several natural price functions are outlined below; each is motivated as the unique solution to a particular constraint on price dynamics. 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages To my knowledge, a DPM is the only known mechanism for hedging and speculating that exhibits all three of the following properties: (1) guaranteed liquidity, (2) no risk for the market institution, and (3) continuous incorporation of information. A standard pari-mutuel fails (3). A CDA fails (1). A CDAwMM, the bookmaker mechanism, and an MSR all fail (2). Even though technically an MSR exposes its patron to risk (i.e., a variable future payoff), the patrons maximum loss is bounded, so the distinction between a DPM and an MSR in terms of these three properties is more technical than practical. DPM traders can cash out of the market early, just like stock market traders, to lock in a profit or limit a loss, an action that is simply not possible in a standard pari-mutuel. A DPM also has some drawbacks. The payoff for a wager depends both on the price at the time of the trade, and on the final payoff per share at the markets close. This contrasts with the CDA variants, where the payoff vector across possible future outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade. So a traders strategic optimization problem is complicated by the need to predict the final values of P1 and P2. If P changes according to a random walk, then traders can take the current P as an unbiased estimate of the final P, greatly decreasing the complexity of their optimization. If P does not change according to a random walk, the mechanism still has utility as a mechanism for hedging and speculating, though optimization may be difficult, and determining a measure of the markets aggregate opinion of the probabilities of A and B may be difficult. We discuss the implications of random walk behavior further below in Section 4.1 in the discussion surrounding Assumption 3. A second drawback of a DPM is its one-sided nature. 173 While an automated market maker always stands ready to accept buy orders, there is no corresponding market maker to accept sell orders. Traders must sell to each other using a standard CDA mechanism, for example by posting an ask order at a price at or below the market makers current ask price. Traders can also always hedge-sell by purchasing shares in the opposite outcome from the market maker, thereby hedging their bet if not fully liquidating it. 3.3 Redistribution rule In a standard pari-mutuel market, payoffs can be computed in either of two equivalent ways: (1) each winning $1 wager receives a refund of the initial $1 paid, plus an equal share of all losing wagers, or (2) each winning $1 wager receives an equal share of all wagers, winning or losing. Because each dollar always earns an equal share of the payoff, the two formulations are precisely the same: $1 + Mlose Mwin = Mwin + Mlose Mwin . In a dynamic pari-mutuel market, because each dollar is not equally weighted, the two formulations are distinct, and lead to significantly different price functions and mechanisms, each with different potentially desirable properties. We consider each case in turn. The next section analyzes case (1), where only losing money is redistributed. Section 5 examines case (2), where all money is redistributed. 4. DPM I: LOSING MONEY REDISTRIBUTED For the case where the initial payments on winning bets are refunded, and only losing money is redistributed, the respective payoffs per share are simply: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2 . So, if A occurs, shareholders of A receive all of their initial payment back, plus P1 dollars per share owned, while shareholders of B lose all money wagered. Similarly, if B occurs, shareholders of B receive all of their initial payment back, plus P2 dollars per share owned, while shareholders of A lose all money wagered. Without loss of generality, I will analyze the market from the perspective of A, deriving prices and payoffs for A only. The equations for B are symmetric. The traders per-share expected value for purchasing an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A is E[ shares] = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 E[ shares] = Pr(A) · E » M2 N1 ˛ ˛ ˛ ˛ A − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 where is an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A, Pr(A) is the traders belief in the probability of A, and p1 is the instantaneous price per share of A for an infinitesimal quantity of shares. E[P1|A] is the traders expectation of the payoff per share of A after the market closes and given that A occurs. This is a subtle point. The value of P1 does not matter if B occurs, since in this case shares of A are worthless, and the current value of P1 does not necessarily matter as this may change as trading continues. So, in order to determine the expected value of shares of A, the trader must estimate what he or she expects the payoff per share to be in the end (after the market closes) if A occurs. If E[ shares]/ > 0, a risk-neutral trader should purchase shares of A. How many shares? This depends on the price function determining p1. In general, p1 increases as more shares are purchased. The risk-neutral trader should continue purchasing shares until E[ shares]/ = 0. (A riskaverse trader will generally stop purchasing shares before driving E[ shares]/ all the way to zero.) Assuming riskneutrality, the traders optimization problem is to choose a number of shares n ≥ 0 of A to purchase, in order to maximize E[n shares] = Pr(A)·n·E [P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· Z n 0 p1(n)dn. (1) Its easy to see that the same value of n can be solved for by finding the number of shares required to drive E[ shares]/ to zero. That is, find n ≥ 0 satisfying 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), if such a n exists, otherwise n = 0. 4.1 Market probability As traders who believe that E[ shares of A]/ > 0 purchase shares of A and traders who believe that E[ shares of B]/ > 0 purchase shares of B, the prices p1 and p2 change according to a price function, as prescribed below. The current prices in a sense reflect the markets opinion as a whole of the relative probabilities of A and B. Assuming an efficient marketplace, the market as a whole considers E[ shares]/ = 0, since the mechanisms is a zero sum game. For example, if market participants in aggregate felt that E[ shares]/ > 0, then there would be net demand for A, driving up the price of A until E[ shares]/ = 0. Define MPr(A) to be the market probability of A, or the probability of A inferred by assuming that E[ shares]/ = 0. We can consider MPr(A) to be the aggregate probability of A as judged by the market as a whole. MPr(A) is the solution to 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Solving we get MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) At this point we make a critical assumption in order to greatly simplify the analysis; we assume that E[P1|A] = P1. (3) That is, we assume that the current value for the payoff per share of A is the same as the expected final value of the payoff per share of A given that A occurs. This is certainly true for the last (infinitesimal) wager before the market closes. Its not obvious, however, that the assumption is true well before the markets close. Basically, we are assuming that the value of P1 moves according to an unbiased random walk: the current value of P1 is the best expectation of its future value. I conjecture that there are reasonable market efficiency conditions under which assumption (3) is true, though I have not been able to prove that it arises naturally from rational trading. We examine scenarios below in which 174 assumption (3) seems especially plausible. Nonetheless, the assumption effects our analysis only. Regardless of whether (3) is true, each price function derived below implies a welldefined zero-sum game in which traders can play. If traders can assume that (3) is true, then their optimization problem (1) is greatly simplified; however, optimizing (1) does not depend on the assumption, and traders can still optimize by strategically projecting the final expected payoff in whatever complicated way they desire. So, the utility of DPM for hedging and speculating does not necessarily hinge on the truth of assumption (3). On the other hand, the ability to easily infer an aggregate market consensus probability from market prices does depend on (3). 4.2 Price functions A variety of price functions seem reasonable, each exhibiting various properties, and implying differing market probabilities. 4.2.1 Price function I: Price of A equals payoff of B One natural price function to consider is to set the price per share of A equal to the payoff per share of B, and set the price per share of B equal to the payoff per share of A. That is, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Enforcing this relationship reduces the dimensionality of the system from four to two, simplifying the interface: traders need only track two numbers instead of four. The relationship makes sense, since new information supporting A should encourage purchasing of shares A, driving up both the price of A and the payoff of B, and driving down the price of B and the payoff of A. In this setting, assumption (3) seems especially reasonable, since if an efficient market hypothesis leads prices to follow a random walk, than payoffs must also follow a random walk. The constraints (4) lead to the following derivation of the market probability: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) The constraints (4) specify the instantaneous relationship between payoff and price. From this, we can derive how prices change when (non-infinitesimal) shares are purchased. Let n be the number of shares purchased and let m be the amount of money spent purchasing n shares. Note that p1 = dm/dn, the instantaneous price per share, and m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Substituting into equation (4), we get: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) Equation 6 gives the cost of purchasing n shares. The instantaneous price per share as a function of n is p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2 . (7) Note that p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 as required. The derivation of the price function p2(n) for B is analogous and the results are symmetric. The notion of buying infinitesimal shares, or integrating costs over a continuous function, are probably foreign to most traders. A more standard interface can be implemented by discretizing the costs into round lots of shares, for example lots of 100 shares. Then ask orders of 100 shares each at the appropriate price can be automatically placed by the market institution. For example, the market institution can place an ask order for 100 shares at price m(100)/100, another ask order for 100 shares at price (m(200)−m(100))/100, a third ask for 100 shares at (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. In this way, the market looks more familiar to traders, like a typical CDA with a number of ask orders at various prices automatically available. A trader buying less than 100 shares would pay a bit more than if the true cost were computed using (6), but the discretized interface would probably be more intuitive and transparent to the majority of traders. The above equations assume that all money that comes in is eventually returned or redistributed. In other words, the mechanism is a zero sum game, and the market institution takes no portion of the money. This could be generalized so that the market institution always takes a certain amount, or a certain percent, or a certain amount per transaction, or a certain percent per transaction, before money in returned or redistributed. Finally, note that the above price function is undefined when the amount bet or the number of shares are zero. So the system must begin with some positive amount on both sides, and some positive number of shares outstanding on both sides. These initial amounts can be arbitrarily small in principle, but the size of the initial subsidy may affect the incentives of traders to participate. Also, the smaller the initial amounts, the more each new dollar effects the prices. The initialization amounts could be funded as a subsidy from the market institution or a patron, which Ill call a seed wager, or from a portion of the fees charged, which Ill call an ante wager. 4.2.2 Price function II: Price of A proportional to money on A A second price function can be derived by requiring the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered. 175 That is, p1 p2 = M1 M2 . (8) In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B. This seems like a particularly natural way to set the price, since the more money that is wagered on one side, the cheaper becomes a share on the other side, in exactly the same proportion. Using Equation 8, along with (2) and (3), we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) We can solve for the instantaneous price as follows: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the implied cost function m as a function of the number n of shares purchased as follows: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) From this we get the price function: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Note that, as required, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, and p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B, which seems fairly natural. Note that, as before, the mechanism can be modified to collect transaction fees of some kind. Also note that seed or ante wagers are required to initialize the system. 5. DPM II: ALL MONEY REDISTRIBUTED Above we examined the policy of refunding winning wagers and redistributing only losing wagers. In this section we consider the second policy mentioned in Section 3.3: all money from all wagers are collected and redistributed to winning wagers. For the case where all money is redistributed, the respective payoffs per share are: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2 , where T = M1 + M2 is the total amount of money wagered on both sides. So, if A occurs, shareholders of A lose their initial price paid, but receive P1 dollars per share owned; shareholders of B simply lose all money wagered. Similarly, if B occurs, shareholders of B lose their initial price paid, but receive P2 dollars per share owned; shareholders of A lose all money wagered. In this case, the traders per-share expected value for purchasing an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A is E[ shares] = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − p1. (13) A risk-neutral trader optimizes by choosing a number of shares n ≥ 0 of A to purchase, in order to maximize E[n shares] = Pr(A) · n · E [P1|A] − Z n 0 p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E [P1|A] − m (14) The same value of n can be solved for by finding the number of shares required to drive E[ shares]/ to zero. That is, find n ≥ 0 satisfying 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − p1(n), if such a n exists, otherwise n = 0. 5.1 Market probability In this case MPr(A), the aggregate probability of A as judged by the market as a whole, is the solution to 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Solving we get MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) As before, we make the simplifying assumption (3) that the expected final payoff per share equals the current payoff per share. The assumption is critical for our analysis, but may not be required for a practical implementation. 5.2 Price functions For the case where all money is distributed, the constraints (4) that keep the price of A equal to the payoff of B, and vice versa, do not lead to the derivation of a coherent price function. A reasonable price function can be derived from the constraint (8) employed in Section 4.2.2, where we require that the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered. That is, p1/p2 = M1/M2. In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B. 176 Using Equations 3, 8, and 15 we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Interestingly, this is the same market probability derived in Section 4.2.1 for the case of losing-money redistribution with the constraints that the price of A equal the payoff of B and vice versa. The instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares is: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the number of shares n that can be purchased for m dollars, as follows: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Note that we solved for n(m) rather than m(n). I could not find a closed-form solution for m(n), as was derived for the two other cases above. Still, n(m) can be used to determine how many shares can be purchased for m dollars, and the inverse function can be approximated to any degree numerically. From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B. This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3). That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0. The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even. The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs. This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7. When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff. Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7. On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money. Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome. From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks. One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome. At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price. Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6. OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0. In this case, prices would only go up. For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome. Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket. I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above. Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists. Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7. AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss. This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker. So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker. Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price. Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple. In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism. Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares. New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader. In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket. However, an aftermarket is still possible. In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue. In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise. One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components. However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM. In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets. The bundling mechanism works as follows. Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1. A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1. The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars. If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket. The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling. Consider a share of A purchased for $5. The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A. Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit. The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A. The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff. So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment. The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains. Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share. The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2. The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded). The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A. The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5. If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3. Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8. CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM). The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation. To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties. An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics. Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased. The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price. I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed. Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions. I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9. FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market. Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture. The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis. Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when? How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests. This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism. However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment. In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market. I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time. The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables. I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100). However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting. I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task. DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen. Acknowledgments I thank Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow, and Robin Hanson. 10. REFERENCES [1] Mukhtar M.

Pennockd@yahoo-inc.com Resumen I Desarrollar un nuevo mecanismo para la asignación de riesgos y la especulación de información llamada mercado dinámico Pari-Mutuel (DPM). Un DPM actúa como híbrido entre un mercado pari-mutuel y una subasta doble continua (CDA), heredando algunas de las ventajas de ambos. Al igual que un mercado pari-mutuel, un DPM ofrece una liquidez infinita de aceptación y un riesgo cero para la institución del mercado;Al igual que un CDA, un DPM puede reaccionar continuamente a la nueva información, incorporar dinámicamente información a los precios y permitir a los comerciantes bloquear las ganancias o limitar las pérdidas vendiendo antes de la resolución de eventos. La interfaz del comerciante se puede diseñar para imitar el formato de subasta doble familiar con colas de oferta de oferta, aunque con una variable de adición llamada recompensa por acción. La función de precio de DPM se puede ver como un fabricante de mercado automatizado que siempre ofrece vender a algún precio y mover el precio de manera adecuada según la demanda. Dado que el mecanismo es pari-mutuel (es decir, redistributivo), se garantiza que pagará exactamente la cantidad de dinero tomado.

Introducción Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuesta para apoyar la cobertura (es decir, asegurar) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o comercio especulativo en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en los círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos el CDA con el fabricante de mercado (CDAWMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o un apuestas de apuestas, que esencialmente actúa exactamente como fabricante de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de Jai alai emplean tradicionalmente el mecanismo pari-mutuel. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, los dos esfuerzos se consideran socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDA o CDAWMM para todo tipo de apuestas, incluso en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta para usar sistemas de apuestas para apostarmercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y desdibujan aún más la línea entre la inversión y las apuestas. Algunas compañías a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria que declaran el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de apuestas.1 Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución de mercado y los comerciantes participantes. Un CDA solo coincide con los comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir la iliquidez en la forma enormes spreads de oferta de ofertas o incluso colas vacías de ofertas de ofertas si el comercio es ligero y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de pollo y huevo: los comerciantes se sienten atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren una gran cantidad de comerciantes. Un CDAWMM y el mecanismo de apuestas similar tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el fabricante de mercado, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto al riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAWMM ofrecen incentivos para que los operadores aprovechen la información continuamente tan pronto como esa información esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan el estado actual de la información excepcionalmente bien. Los mercados de pari-mutuel tienen una liquidez infinita: cualquiera puede apostar en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin la necesidad de una oferta de correspondencia de otro apostador o un fabricante de mercado. Los mercados pari-mutuel también implican ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de perder apuestas a apuestas ganadoras. Sin embargo, Pari-Mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets no es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que hay un fuerte desincentivo para colocarseApuestas hasta que (1) se revele toda la información, o (2) el mercado está a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios pari-mutuel antes del cierre de los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado pari-mutuel no pueden comprar y vender altos: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar las pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Debido a que el proceso mediante el cual la información llega continuamente a lo largo del tiempo es la regla más que la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo de pari-mutuel estándar es cuestionable en una gran cantidad de configuraciones. En este documento, desarrollar un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuesta, llamado mercado dinámico parimutuel (DPM). Se puede considerar que un DPM es un híbrido entre un mercado pari-mutuel y un CDA. Un DPM es de verdad en la naturaleza pari-mutul, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos comerciantes a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y predeterminado para comenzar el mercado. En principio, el subsidio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenir de comerciantes (a través de antes o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial puede fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado pari-mutuel: los comerciantes siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a algún precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también puede reaccionar e incorporar información que llegue con el tiempo, como un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basados en el estado actual de apuestas. Si un resultado particular recibe una cantidad relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta;Si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precio, que puede diferir dependiendo de qué propiedades se deseen. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones;El costo total de compras n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n.La complejidad de la función de precio se puede ocultar a los comerciantes comunicando solo los precios de solicitud de varias lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, muchas 100 acciones), al igual que la práctica común en CDA y CDAWMMS. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden cobrar en un posventa para obtener ganancias o limitar las pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Si bien siempre hay un fabricante de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un fabricante de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta y, por lo tanto, no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en cambio, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden vender de cobertura comprando el resultado opuesto de lo que ya poseen.2. Antecedentes y trabajo relacionado 2.1 mercados Pari-Mutueles Pari-Mutuel Los mercados son comunes en las carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], las carreras de perros y los juegos de Jai Alai. En un mercado pari-Mutuel, las personas colocan apuestas sobre cuáles se producirán dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conoce el verdadero resultado, todo el dinero que pierde aquellos que apostan por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apuestan por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad que se apoderaron. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, K caballos, exactamente uno de los cuales ganará), y M1, M2 ,..., Los dólares de MK son apuestas en cada resultado, y el resultado que ocurre, luego todos los que apostan por un resultado j = yo pierde su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostarán por el resultado recibo PK J = 1 mJ/Mi dólares por cada dólar que se apostaron. Es decir, cada dólar apostaron que recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero que se apostaron. Una forma equivalente de pensar sobre la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar se reembolsa en I es reembolsado, luego recibe una parte igual de todos los dinero restantes en los resultados perdedores, o p j = i mj/mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución de mercado (por ejemplo, la pista de carreras) primero toma un cierto porcentaje de la cantidad total que se apostaron, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, luego redistribuye cualquier dinero que quede a los ganadores en proporción a su cantidad de apuesta. Considere un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que PR (A ∧ B) = 0 y PR (A) + PR (B) = 1. Supongamos que $ 800 se apuesta por A y $ 200 en B. Ahora suponga que se produce A (por ejemplo, Horse A gana la carrera). Las personas que se apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $ 200 en total. Las personas que se apostaron por una victoria y cada una recibe una proporción proporcional del total de $ 1000 apostar (ignorando las tarifas). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $ 1 en un derecho a su propietario una acción de 1/800 de los $ 1000, o $ 1.25. Cada apuesta en dólares en un mercado pari-mutuel tiene una pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se colocó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diversos resultados en el momento en que se colocó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: las cantidades finales se apostaron por todos los resultados cuando el mercado se cierra y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para hacer una apuesta temprano si existe alguna posibilidad de que esté disponible una nueva información. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que no será negativo si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de pago pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que se cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas finales de pago. Esto contrasta con CDA y CDAWMMS, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revela nueva información. Se puede permitir que los apostadores pari-mutuel cambien su resultado elegido, o incluso cancele su apuesta, antes del cierre de los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden cobrar el mercado temprano, ya sea para bloquear ganancias o limitar las pérdidas, si la nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAWMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un posventa para vender apuestas existentes no es sensato: cada dólar apostar vale exactamente $ 1 hasta que los mercados cierran, no uno compraría a más de $ 1 y nadie se vendería a menos de $ 1. Los apostadores pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para obtener cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado pari-mutuel, cualquiera puede apostar a cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento, en cierto sentido hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAWMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el fabricante del mercado. En un mercado pari-mutuel, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución de mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. El principal inconveniente de un mercado pari-mutuel es que es útil solo para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en algún instante en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que llega la información con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado de las situaciones de activos comunes en AL171, la mayoría de los escenarios comerciales y de apuestas. No hay noción de comprar bajos y vender altas, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) es recompensado más que comprar cuando muchos otros están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, los mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real a la información cambiante se emplean más típicamente para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado pari-mutuel puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado repetido pari-mutuel, donde se ejecutan distintos mercados de pari-mutuel a intervalos consecutivos, podría en principio capturar la dinámica de información cambiante. Pero ejecutar múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente disminuiría el comercio en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado individual de pari-mutuel, los incentivos aún serían esperar para apostar hasta justo antes del tiempo final de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría mitigarse instituyendo una regla de detención aleatoria para cada mercado individual de pari-mutuel. En los experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de pari-mutuel han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los comerciantes, al menos para una sola instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Se ha reconocido una habilidad similar en las carreras reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26].2.2 Los mercados financieros en el mundo financiero, las apuestas sobre los resultados de las proposiciones futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas abarca genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Los ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE [13], mercados de futuros como el CME [21], otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados de valores políticos [6, 7], mercados de futuros de ideas [12], mercados de decisiones, mercados de decisiones.[10] e incluso juegos de mercado [3, 15, 16]. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los comerciantes cubrir el riesgo o asegurarse contra resultados indeseables. Entonces, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, puede mitigar el riesgo apostando el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta de que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. Del mismo modo, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta de que las acciones subyacentes disminuirán. En la práctica, los agentes participan en una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre los dos [14]. Al igual que los mercados pari-mutuel, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, que producen pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA coincide constantemente con los pedidos de comprar un activo con órdenes para vender. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta de PBID, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de solicitación de Pask, y PBID es mayor o igual a Pask, luego las dos partes transacciones (a algún precio entre PBID y Pask). Si el precio de oferta más alto es menor que el precio de solicitud más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y solicitación cambian rápidamente a medida que llega la nueva información y los comerciantes reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo coincide con los postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores están dispuestos a vender;Para que ocurra cualquier transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesto a aceptar el comercio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en un CDA, puede volverse ilíquido, lo que significa que no se produce mucha actividad comercial. El diferencial entre el precio de oferta más alto y el precio de solicitud más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desanimando el comercio.2 Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar a un fabricante de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran númerode compra y venta de pedidos a precios particulares. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con Market Maker (CDAWMM) .3 Conceptualmente, el fabricante de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero generalmente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El fabricante de mercado puede ser una persona, o puede ser un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un fabricante de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al fabricante del mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo las operaciones coincidentes, el sistema realmente asume el riesgo de su propio, y dependiendo de lo que sucede en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero.2.3 Mercados de apuestas La apuesta típica de Las Vegas Funciones o del fabricante de probabilidades como un fabricante de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución de mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, 4 inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas sobre los diversos resultados. A diferencia de un entorno pari-mutuel, cada vez que se coloca una apuesta con una casa de apuestas, las probabilidades o los términos para esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. La casa de apuestas se beneficia al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, esencialmente definiendo una extensión de Bidask. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada en las probabilidades previamente establecidas permanecen vigentes de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta;Esto está precisamente en analogía con un CDAWMM. Una diferencia entre una casa de apuestas y un fabricante de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo Take It o Leave It: los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en realidad solo pueden colocar pedidos de mercado a precios definidos por la casa de apuestas. Aún así, la casa de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de apostadores. Al igual que un fabricante de mercado, la casa de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. También se ha demostrado que los mercados de apuestas deportivas proporcionan pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23].2.4 Regla de puntuación del mercado Hansons [11] Regla de puntuación del mercado (MSR) es un nuevo mecanismo para cubrir y especular que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Al igual que un DPM, un MSR puede conceptualizarse como un fabricante de mercado automatizado que siempre está dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere un patrón para subsidiar el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable y, por lo tanto, técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad en todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, los 2 mercados delgados ocurren a menudo en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://tradesports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo.3 Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAWMM es el mercado de apuestas interactivas en http://wsex.com.4 o, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para proporcionar probabilidades de dinero uniforme.172 comerciante que cree que las probabilidades están mal pueden cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución aceptando un boleto de lotería que valga la pena de acuerdo con una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese comerciante también acepte pagarLa persona más reciente en cambiar la distribución. En el límite de un solo comerciante, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para encuestar a un solo agente para su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado esencialmente siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los resultados posibles, el mecanismo evita el problema de los mercados delgados o la iliquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el patrón en general inyecta una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un fabricante de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un fabricante de mercado automatizado unilateral. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre los resultados se fija en el momento del comercio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos en los resultados depende tanto del estado de apuesta en el momento del comercio como del estado de apuestas en elLos mercados cierran. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, por lo que la aceptación y los incentivos del comerciante pueden diferir fuertemente, las propiedades y las motivaciones de DPM y MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los clientes por subsidiar el comercio en todas las combinaciones posibles de N eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar a los n marginales de eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo fue planeado para su uso en el mercado de análisis de políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en los resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA [20], hasta que una tormenta de medios mató el proyecto.5 A partir de este escrito, los fundadores de PAM fueronconsiderando la reapertura bajo control privado.6 3. Una descripción dinámica del mercado pari-moutuel 3.1 de alto nivel en contraste con un mercado de pari-mutista estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual de la recompensa, en un dpm cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado deapostar en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta en A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás se apuesta en B ofrece una ganancia mayor posible que una apuesta en A cuando la mayoría de los demás también se apuesta por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el pago cambiante de una apuesta es decir que, en un momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado del otro. Comprar una acción da derecho a su propietario a una participación igual en la olla ganadora en caso de que ocurra el resultado elegido. La recompensa es variable, porque cuando pocas personas apostan por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas apostan a ese resultado. No existe un límite predeterminado en el número de acciones: las nuevas acciones se pueden generar continuamente como ingresos por negociación. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario;Generalizar a múltiples resultados discretos debe ser sencillo. Denota los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y EX5 consulte http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismasket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios.6 http://www.policyanalysismasket.com/ Haustive. Denota el precio instantáneo por acción de A AS P1 y el precio por acción de B como P2. Denota los pagos por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, P1, P2, P1, P2 son los números clave que los operadores deben rastrear y comprender. Tenga en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta;La recompensa por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un comerciante puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A AT Price P1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que los cambios de precio continuamente a medida que se compran las acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n.El uso de funciones e integrales continuas se puede ocultar a los comerciantes agregando los fabricantes de mercado automatizados que venden órdenes en lotes discretos de, por ejemplo, 100 acciones cada una. Estas órdenes de solicitud pueden ser ingresadas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los comerciantes interactúan con lo que parece un CDA más familiar;Examinamos esta cuestión de la interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, presentamos la siguiente notación adicional. Denota M1 como la cantidad total de dinero que se apostaron en A, M2, ya que la cantidad total de dinero se apostaron en B, T = M1 + M2, ya que la cantidad total de dinero se apostaron en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A,y n2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. Varias funciones de precios naturales se describen a continuación;Cada uno está motivado como la solución única para una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios.3.2 Ventajas y desventajas que yo sepa, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cubrir y especular que exhibe las tres propiedades siguientes: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado, y (3) incorporación continuade información. Un pari-mut Estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla (1). Un CDAWMM, el mecanismo de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su patrón al riesgo (es decir, un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima de los clientes está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los comerciantes de DPM pueden cobrar el mercado temprano, al igual que los comerciantes del mercado de valores, para bloquear una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un pari-Mutuel estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunos inconvenientes. La recompensa para una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento de la operación como de la recompensa final por acción en el cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes CDA, donde el vector de pago en los posibles resultados futuros se fija en el momento del comercio. Por lo tanto, un problema de optimización estratégica de comerciantes se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia según una caminata aleatoria, los comerciantes pueden tomar la P actual como una estimación imparcial de la P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia de acuerdo con una caminata aleatoria, el mecanismo todavía tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil, y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados de las probabilidades de A y B puede ser difícil. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de la caminata aleatoria más abajo en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión que rodea la Asunción 3. Un segundo inconveniente de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral.173 Si bien un fabricante de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar las órdenes de compra, no hay un fabricante de mercado correspondiente para aceptar pedidos de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando un pedido de solicitud a un precio en o inferior al precio de venta actual. Los comerciantes también siempre pueden vender de cobertura comprando acciones en el resultado opuesto del fabricante del mercado, cobrando así su apuesta si no se liquidan por completo.3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado estándar de pari-mutuel, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada una apuesta ganadora de $ 1 recibe un reembolso de los $ 1 iniciales pagados, más una participación igual de todos los apuestas perdedoras, o (2) Cada apuesta ganadora de $ 1 recibe una participación igual de todas las apuestas, ganando o perdiendo. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una participación igual de la recompensa, las dos formulaciones son precisamente las mismas: $ 1 + mlose mwin = mwin + mlose mwin. En un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuel, debido a que cada dólar no está igualmente ponderado, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones y mecanismos de precios significativamente diferentes, cada uno con diferentes propiedades potencialmente deseables. Consideramos cada caso a su vez. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye la pérdida de dinero. La Sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde se redistribuye todo el dinero.4. DPM I: Perder dinero redistribuido para el caso en el que se reembolsan los pagos iniciales sobre las apuestas ganadoras, y solo la pérdida de dinero se redistribuye, los pagos respectivos por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Entonces, si se produce A, los accionistas de A reciben todos sus pagos iniciales, más dólares de P1 por acción, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero que se apostaron. Del mismo modo, si se produce B, los accionistas de B reciben todo su pago inicial, más dólares de P2 por acción, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero que se apostaron. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando los precios y los pagos solo por un solo. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado de los comerciantes por acción para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de a es e [acciones] = pr (a) · e [p1 | a]-(1-pr (a)) · p1 e [acciones] = pr] = pr(A) · e »m2 n1 ˛ ˛ ˛ ˛ a - (1 - pr (a)) · p1 donde es una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de a, pr (a) es la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de a y p1es el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E [P1 | a] es la expectativa de los comerciantes de la recompensa por acción de A después de que se cierre el mercado y dado que se produce A. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si se produce B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa, ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa la negociación. Entonces, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar lo que él o ella espera que la recompensa por acción esté al final (después de que se cierre el mercado) si se produce A. Si E [acciones]/> 0, un operador neutral en neutral de riesgo debe comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina P1. En general, P1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El operador neutral de riesgo debe continuar comprando acciones hasta E [acciones]/ = 0. (un operador de riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de conducir E [acciones]/ todo el camino a cero). Suponiendo que Riskneutrality, el problema de optimización de los comerciantes es elegir una serie de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, para maximizar E [n acciones] = PR (a) · n · e [p1 | a] - (1 -PR(A)) · z n 0 p1 (n) dn.(1) Es fácil ver que se puede resolver el mismo valor de N al encontrar el número de acciones necesarias para impulsar E [acciones]/ a cero. Es decir, encuentre n ≥ 0 satisfacer 0 = pr (a) · e [p1 | a] - (1 - pr (a)) · p1 (n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 probabilidad de mercado comoLos comerciantes que creen que E [acciones de A]/> 0 compran acciones de A y comerciantes que creen que E [acciones de B]/> 0 compra acciones de B, los precios P1 y P2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, según lo prescritoabajo. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión de los mercados en su conjunto de las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera E [acciones]/ = 0, ya que los mecanismos son un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en agregado consideraron que E [acciones]/> 0, entonces habría demanda neta de A, lo que aumenta el precio de A hasta que E [acciones]/ = 0. Definir MPR (a) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de una inferida al suponer que E [acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar que el MPR (a) es la probabilidad agregada de A tan juzgada por el mercado en su conjunto. MPR (a) es la solución a 0 = mPr (a) · e [p1 | a] - (1 - mpr (a)) · p1. Resolución obtenemos mpr (a) = p1 p1 + e [p1 | a].(2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar enormemente el análisis;Suponemos que E [P1 | A] = P1.(3) Es decir, suponemos que el valor actual para la recompensa por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado de la recompensa por acción de un dado que se produce. Esto es ciertamente cierto para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que se cierre el mercado. Sin embargo, no es obvio que la suposición sea cierto mucho antes de que se cierren los mercados. Básicamente, asumimos que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con una caminata aleatoria imparcial: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjetivo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia del mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del comercio racional. Examinamos escenarios a continuación en los que 174 la suposición (3) parece especialmente plausible. No obstante, la suposición afecta solo a nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los comerciantes pueden jugar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica enormemente;Sin embargo, la optimización (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el recompensa esperado final de cualquier forma complicada que deseen. Entonces, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no necesariamente depende de la verdad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente un consenso de consenso de mercado agregado de los precios del mercado depende de (3).4.2 Funciones de precios Una variedad de funciones de precios parecen razonables, cada una exhibe varias propiedades e implica diferentes probabilidades de mercado.4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A Equals Page de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de un igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual a la recompensapor acción de A. Es decir, p1 = p2 p2 = p1.(4) Hacer cumplir esta relación reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan rastrear dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que la nueva información que respalda A debería fomentar la compra de las acciones A, lo que aumenta tanto el precio de A como el recompensa de B, y la disminución del precio de B y el pago de A. En este entorno, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente lleva a los precios a seguir una caminata aleatoria, los pagos también deben seguir una caminata aleatoria. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPR (A) P1 = MPR (B) P1 MPR (A) P1 = MPR (B) P2 MPR (A) MPR (B) = P2 P1 MPR (A) mpr (b) = m1 n2 m2 n1 mpr (a) mpr (b) = m1n1 m2n2 mpr (a) = m1n1 m1n1 + m2n2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos derivar cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran las acciones (no infinitasimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea la cantidad de dinero gastado comprando n acciones. Tenga en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción y m = r n 0 p1 (n) dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = p2 dm dn = m1 + m n2 dm m1 + m = dn n2 z dm m1 + m = z dn n2 ln (m1 + m) = n n2 + c m = m1H E N N2 - 1 I (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción en función de n es p1 (n) = dm dn = m1 n2 e n n2.(7) Tenga en cuenta que P1 (0) = M1/N2 = P2 según sea necesario. La derivación de la función de precio P2 (N) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos en una función continua, probablemente sea extranjera para la mayoría de los comerciantes. Se puede implementar una interfaz más estándar discretizando los costos en muchas acciones, por ejemplo, muchas 100 acciones. Luego, la institución de mercado puede realizar pedidos de 100 acciones al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución de mercado puede realizar una orden de solicitación de 100 acciones al precio M (100)/100, otro pedido solicitado de 100 acciones al precio (M (200) -m (100))/100, un tercio solicita 100Acciones a (M (300) - M (200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado parece más familiar para los comerciantes, como un CDA típico con una serie de pedidos de solicitud a varios precios disponibles automáticamente. Un comerciante que compra menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo verdadero se calculara usando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los comerciantes. Las ecuaciones anteriores suponen que todo el dinero que entra finalmente se devuelve o se redistribuye. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución del mercado no toma porción del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse para que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes del dinero en el retorno o redistribuido. Finalmente, tenga en cuenta que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apuesta o el número de acciones son cero. Por lo tanto, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados, y un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto más menores son las cantidades iniciales, más cada dólar nuevo afecta los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían financiarse como un subsidio de la institución del mercado o un patrón, que llamará a una apuesta de semillas, o desde una parte de las tarifas cobradas, que llamará a una apuesta ante.4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de una proporcional al dinero en una función de un segundo precio puede derivarse al requerir que la relación de precios sea igual a la relación de dinero apasionado.175 es decir, p1 p2 = m1 m2.(8) En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero que se apodera en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece una forma particularmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que cuanto más dinero se mueve por un lado, más barato se convierte en una acción en el otro lado, exactamente en la misma proporción. Usando la ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: m1 m2 = p1 p2 = mpr (a) mpr (b) · m2 n1 mpr (b) mpr (a) · m1 n2= (Mpr (a)) 2 (mpr (b)) 2 · m2n2 m1n1 (mpr (a)) 2 (mpr (b)) 2 = (m1) 2 n1 (m2) 2n2 mpr (a) mpr (b)= M1 √ n1 m2 √ n2 mpr (a) = m1 √ n1 m1 √ n1 + m2 √ n2 (9) Podemos resolver el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = mpr (a) mpr (b) · p1 = m1 √N1 m2 √ n2 · m2 n1 = m1 √ n1n2 (10) Funcionando desde el precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita en la función del número N de las acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: DM DM = M1 + M √+ n √ n2 z dm m1 + m = z dn √ n1 + n √ n2 ln (m1 + m) = 2 n2 [(n1 + n) n2] 1 2 + c m = m1 e 2 r n1 + n n2 −2 R N1 N2 - 1 #.(11) A partir de esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1 (n) = dm dn = m1 p (n1 + n) n2 e 2 r n1 + n n2 −2 r n1 n2.(12) Tenga en cuenta que, según sea necesario, p1 (0) = m1/√ n1n2, y p1 (0)/p2 (0) = m1/m2. Si uno usa la función de precios anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la relación de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre es igual a la relación de las cantidades que se apoderan de A y B, lo que parece bastante natural. Tenga en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo puede modificarse para recaudar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semillas o ante para inicializar el sistema.5. DPM II: Todo el dinero redistribuido anteriormente examinamos la política de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: Todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuyen a apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que se redistribuye todo el dinero, los pagos respectivos por acción son: p1 = m1 + m2 n1 = t n1 p2 = m1 + m2 n2 = t n2, donde t = m1 + m2 es la cantidad total de dinero apasionado en amboslados. Entonces, si se produce A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben dólares de P1 por acción propiedad;Los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero que se apostaron. Del mismo modo, si se produce B, los accionistas de B pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción propiedad;Los accionistas de una pérdida de todo el dinero se apostaron. En este caso, el valor esperado de los comerciantes por acción para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E [acciones] = PR (A) · E [P1 | A]-P1.(13) Un operador neutral de riesgo optimiza al elegir una serie de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, para maximizar E [n acciones] = PR (a) · n · e [p1 | a]-z n 0p1 (n) dn = pr (a) · n · e [p1 | a] - m (14) Se puede resolver el mismo valor de n al encontrar el número de acciones necesarias para impulsar E [acciones]/ a cero. Es decir, encuentre n ≥ 0 satisfaciendo 0 = pr (a) · e [p1 | a] - p1 (n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 probabilidad de mercado en este caso mpr (a), el agregadoLa probabilidad de A según el mercado en su conjunto, es la solución a 0 = MPR (a) · E [P1 | A] - P1. Resolución obtenemos mpr (a) = p1 e [p1 | a].(15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la recompensa final esperada por acción es igual a la recompensa actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero es posible que no sea necesario para una implementación práctica.5.2 Funciones de precio para el caso en el que se distribuye todo el dinero, las limitaciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Se puede derivar una función de precio razonable de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la relación de precios sea igual a la relación de dinero que se apostaron. Es decir, p1/p2 = m1/m2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero que se mueve en A, y de manera similar para B. 176 usando las ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15 podemos obtener la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = P1 P2 = MPR (A) MPr (b) · t n1 · n2 t = mpr (a) mpr (b) · n2 n1 mpr (a) mpr (b) = m1n1 m2n2 mpr (a) = m1n1 m1n1 + m2n2 (16) interesante, esto esLa misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de perder la redistribución de dinero con las limitaciones de que el precio es igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (m1) 2 + m1m2 m1n1 + m2n2 = m1 + m2 n1 + m2 m1 n2 trabajando desde el precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar el número de acciones que pueden poder puedenser comprado para M dólares, de la siguiente manera: DM DN = M1 + M2 + M N1 + N + M2 M1 + M N2 DN DM = N1 + N + M2 M1 + M N2 M1 + M2 + M (17) · · · N= m (n1 - n2) t + n2 (t + m) m2 ln »t (m1 + m) m1 (t + m). Tenga en cuenta que resolvimos para n (m) en lugar de m (n). No pude encontrar una solución de forma cerrada para M (N), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Aún así, N (M) se puede usar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por dólares M, y la función inversa puede aproximarse a cualquier grado numéricamente. De n (m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1 (m) = dm dn = (m1 + m) m2t denom, (18) donde denom = (m1 + m) m2n1 + (m2 - m) m2n2 + t(M1 + m) n2 ln »t (m1 + m) m1 (t + m) Tenga en cuenta que, según sea necesario, p1 (0)/p2 (0) = m1/m2. Si uno usa la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la relación de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre es igual a la relación de las cantidades que se apoderan de A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $ 1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $ 1 en B es igual a cero, suponiendo (3). Es decir, E [$ 1 de A + $ 1 de B] = 0. Se omite la derivación.5.3 Comparación de DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta sobre el resultado ganador está garantizado al menos que alcanzará el punto de equilibrio. La principal desventaja de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras es que las acciones no son homogéneas: cada parte de A, por ejemplo, en realidad está compuesta por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso o un boleto de lotería que paga $ P si se produce, donde P, donde Pes el precio pagado por acción, y (2) una acción de la recompensa final ($ P1) si se produce A. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado de accesorios para cobrar el mercado temprano, lo que examinaremos a continuación en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción da derecho a su propietario a una porción igual de la recompensa final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un posventa es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, debido a que los precios iniciales pagados no son reembolsados por las apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios se balancean lo suficientemente enormemente, una apuesta en el resultado correcto en realidad podría perder dinero. Los operadores deben ser conscientes de que si compran un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae, lo que permite que muchos otros ingresen a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final independientemente del resultado. De los experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero sin embargo requiere atención al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una solución potencial sería que el fabricante del mercado realice un seguimiento de cuándo el precio está demasiado bajo, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el fabricante de mercado podría dejar de bajar artificialmente el precio. Los pedidos de venta en el mercado de accesorios aún pueden llegar por debajo del precio del mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se rompa.6. Otras variaciones Una función de precio ascendente simple establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α> 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. Para el caso de que se redistribuya todo el dinero, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta en el resultado correcto. A pesar de que el precio de los fabricantes de mercado solo aumenta, el precio actual puede caer muy por debajo del precio del mercado, ya que los pedidos solicitados se realizan en el mercado de accesorios. He derivado funciones de precios para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propias propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es el mejor, o incluso que existe un mejor método. Análisis adicionales y, lo que es más importante, se requieren investigaciones empíricas para responder estas preguntas.7. Los poskarkets Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado estándar de pari-mutuel es la capacidad de cobrar el mercado antes de que se cierre, para obtener ganancias o limitar una pérdida. Esto se logra al permitir que los comerciantes coloquen pedidos en la misma cola que el fabricante de mercado. Por lo tanto, los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron a los precios establecidos por el fabricante del mercado. O los comerciantes pueden realizar un pedido de venta límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente a la venta a los precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al fabricante del mercado.7.1 Pasal de posventa para DPM II para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde se redistribuye todo el dinero 177, permitiendo que un mercado de accesorios sea simple. De hecho, el mercado de accesorios puede ser un descriptor deficiente: comprar y vender están completamente integrados en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción vale precisamente la misma cantidad, por lo que los comerciantes pueden simplemente hacer pedidos de solicitación en la misma cola que el fabricante de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del fabricante del mercado u otro comerciante. De esta manera, los comerciantes pueden cobrar temprano y alejarse con sus ganancias o pérdidas actuales, suponiendo que puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto.7.2 El mercado de accesorios para DPM I cuando se reembolsan las apuestas ganadoras y solo se redistribuyen las apuestas perdedoras, cada acción vale la pena una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ello, por lo que no es un asunto tan simple establecer un mercado de accesorios. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado de accesorios. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los comerciantes, por lo que parece tan simple como realizar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada parte de A en realidad está compuesta por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de dólares P · 1A, y (2) el pago de dólares P1 · 1A, donde P es la acción por acciónEl precio pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que iguala 1 si se produce A, y 0 de lo contrario. Uno puede imaginar ejecutar dos accesorios de accesorios separados donde las personas pueden vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercado de accesorios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la relación correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los comerciantes pueden cobrar retrasando los pedidos de venta en la misma cola que el fabricante de mercado de DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos accesorios de accesorios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual por 1 acción de A es P1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción en P1. El comprador paga dólares P1 y recibe P1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercado de accesorios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando P1 · 1a desde el primer mercado de accesorios, y P1 · 1a desde el segundo mercado de accesorios. El vendedor en el primer mercado de accesorios recibe P1MPR (a) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo posventa recibe dólares P1MPR (b).7.3 Pseudo posventa para DPM I Hay un pseudo posventa alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I que no requiere agrupación. Considere una parte de una comprada por $ 5. La acción está compuesta por $ 5 · 1a y $ P1 · 1A. Ahora suponga que el precio actual ha pasado de $ 5 a $ 10 por acción y el comerciante quiere cobrar con ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acciones al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $ 5), recibiendo todas las inversiones iniciales de $ 5 y retener 1/2 acción de A. La acción de 1/2 vale una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el recompensa final. Por lo tanto, el comerciante queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante esencialmente ha cobrado y encerrado en sus ganancias. Ahora suponga que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $ 5 a $ 2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $ 2. El comprador obtiene la 1 acción más $ 2 · 1a (el precio reembolsado de los compradores). El comerciante (vendedor) obtiene los $ 2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $ 3 · 1A. La pérdida de comerciantes ahora se limita a $ 3 como máximo en lugar de $ 5. Si se produce A, el comerciante llega uniforme;Si se produce B, el comerciante pierde $ 3. También tenga en cuenta que, en los comerciantes de formulación DPM, siempre pueden cobrar la venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin la necesidad de ningún tipo de accesorio para el mercado de accesorios.8. Conclusiones que he presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrir, un futuro evento incierto, llamado un mercado dinámico pari-mutuel (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgos de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación de información continua. Que yo sepa, todos los mecanismos existentes que incluyen el mercado estándar de pari-mutuel, el CDA, el CDAWMM, el mecanismo de apuestas y el MSR-Exhibit como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es el más cercano a un DPM en términos de estas propiedades, si no en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas limitaciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he obtenido en forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, que codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran las acciones. La interfaz para los comerciantes se parece mucho al CDA familiar, con el sistema actuando como un fabricante de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de pedidos de compra a algún precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una en la que solo la pérdida de dinero se redistribuye, y una donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propios pros y contras, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado de accesorios, para que los comerciantes puedan cobrar el mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para bloquear sus ganancias o limitar sus pérdidas, una operación que no es posible en un entorno de pari-mutuel estándar.9. Future Trabajo Este documento informa los resultados de una investigación inicial del concepto de un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuel. Muchas vías para el trabajo futuro se presentan en sí mismos, incluidos los siguientes: • Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. El signo de interrogación más importante en mi mente es si la suposición de caminata aleatoria (3) puede demostrarse en condiciones razonables de eficiencia del mercado y, si no, cuán severamente afecta la practicidad del sistema.• Análisis de incentivos. Formalmente, ¿cuáles son los incentivos para que los operadores actúen sobre nueva información y cuándo? ¿Cómo es el nivel de los incentivos de comerciante inicial de los comerciantes?• Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se concentró en las matemáticas y las algoritmics del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad de los mecanismos para servir como instrumento para cobertura, apuesta o agregación de información es probarlo con comerciantes reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, ¿cómo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo DPM?• Mercado de llamadas DPM. He derivado las funciones de precios para reaccionar a las apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podría generalizarse para aceptar órdenes en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios por completo, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas.• Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden generalizarse fácilmente a múltiples resultados discretos 178, y múltiples resultados de valor real que siempre suman algún valor constante (por ejemplo, múltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar a 100). Sin embargo, la generalización a las variables de valor real con el rango arbitrario es menos clara y abierta para el desarrollo futuro.• Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorios [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuación del mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM también puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto queda por ver. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson.10.

        "A Dynamic Pari-Mutuel Market for Hedging, Wagering, and Information Aggregation David M. Pennock Yahoo!",
        "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
        "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
        "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
        "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
        "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
        "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
        "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
        "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
        "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
        "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
        "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
        "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
        "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
        "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
        "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
        "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
        "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
        "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
        "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
        "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
        "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
        "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
        "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
        "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
        "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
        "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
        "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
        "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
        "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
        "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
        "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
        "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
        "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
        "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
        "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
        "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
        "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
        "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
        "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
        "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
        "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
        "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
        "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
        "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
        "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
        "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
        "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
        "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
        "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
        "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
        "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
        "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
        "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
        "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
        "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
        "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
        "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
        "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
        "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
        "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
        "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
        "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
        "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
        "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
        "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
        "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
        "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
        "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
        "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
        "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
        "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
        "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
        "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
        "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
        "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
        "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
        "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
        "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
        "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
        "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
        "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
        "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
        "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
        "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
        "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
        "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
        "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
        "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
        "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
        "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
        "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
        "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
        "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
        "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
        "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
        "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
        "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
        "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
        "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
        "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
        "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
        "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
        "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
        "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
        "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
        "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
        "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
        "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
        "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
        "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
        "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
        "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
        "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
        "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
        "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
        "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
        "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
        "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
        "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
        "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
        "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
        "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
        "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",

        "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
        "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",

        "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
        "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
        "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",

        "If P does not change according to a random walk, the mechanism still has utility as a mechanism for hedging and speculating, though optimization may be difficult, and determining a measure of the markets aggregate opinion of the probabilities of A and B may be difficult.",
        "We discuss the implications of random walk behavior further below in Section 4.1 in the discussion surrounding Assumption 3.",

        "On the other hand, the ability to easily infer an aggregate market consensus probability from market prices does depend on (3). 4.2 Price functions A variety of price functions seem reasonable, each exhibiting various properties, and implying differing market probabilities. 4.2.1 Price function I: Price of A equals payoff of B One natural price function to consider is to set the price per share of A equal to the payoff per share of B, and set the price per share of B equal to the payoff per share of A.",

        "A more standard interface can be implemented by discretizing the costs into round lots of shares, for example lots of 100 shares.",
        "Then ask orders of 100 shares each at the appropriate price can be automatically placed by the market institution.",
        "For example, the market institution can place an ask order for 100 shares at price m(100)/100, another ask order for 100 shares at price (m(200)−m(100))/100, a third ask for 100 shares at (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc.",
        "In this way, the market looks more familiar to traders, like a typical CDA with a number of ask orders at various prices automatically available.",

        "In other words, the mechanism is a zero sum game, and the market institution takes no portion of the money.",
        "This could be generalized so that the market institution always takes a certain amount, or a certain percent, or a certain amount per transaction, or a certain percent per transaction, before money in returned or redistributed.",
        "Finally, note that the above price function is undefined when the amount bet or the number of shares are zero.",
        "So the system must begin with some positive amount on both sides, and some positive number of shares outstanding on both sides.",
        "These initial amounts can be arbitrarily small in principle, but the size of the initial subsidy may affect the incentives of traders to participate.",
        "Also, the smaller the initial amounts, the more each new dollar effects the prices.",

(8) In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B.",
        "This seems like a particularly natural way to set the price, since the more money that is wagered on one side, the cheaper becomes a share on the other side, in exactly the same proportion.",
        "Using Equation 8, along with (2) and (3), we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) We can solve for the instantaneous price as follows: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the implied cost function m as a function of the number n of shares purchased as follows: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) From this we get the price function: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Note that, as required, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, and p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
        "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B, which seems fairly natural.",

        "Solving we get MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) As before, we make the simplifying assumption (3) that the expected final payoff per share equals the current payoff per share.",
        "The assumption is critical for our analysis, but may not be required for a practical implementation. 5.2 Price functions For the case where all money is distributed, the constraints (4) that keep the price of A equal to the payoff of B, and vice versa, do not lead to the derivation of a coherent price function.",
        "A reasonable price function can be derived from the constraint (8) employed in Section 4.2.2, where we require that the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered.",
        "That is, p1/p2 = M1/M2.",
        "In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B. 176 Using Equations 3, 8, and 15 we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Interestingly, this is the same market probability derived in Section 4.2.1 for the case of losing-money redistribution with the constraints that the price of A equal the payoff of B and vice versa.",
        "The instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares is: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the number of shares n that can be purchased for m dollars, as follows: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) .",
        "Note that we solved for n(m) rather than m(n).",
        "I could not find a closed-form solution for m(n), as was derived for the two other cases above.",
        "Still, n(m) can be used to determine how many shares can be purchased for m dollars, and the inverse function can be approximated to any degree numerically.",
        "From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
        "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B.",
        "This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3).",
        "That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0.",
        "The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even.",
        "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
        "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
        "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
        "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
        "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
        "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
        "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
        "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
        "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
        "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
        "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0.",
        "In this case, prices would only go up.",
        "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
        "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
        "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
        "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
        "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
        "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
        "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
        "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
        "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
        "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
        "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
        "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
        "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
        "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
        "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
        "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
        "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
        "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
        "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
        "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
        "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
        "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
        "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
        "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
        "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
        "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
        "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
        "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
        "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
        "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
        "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
        "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
        "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
        "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
        "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
        "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
        "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
        "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
        "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
        "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
        "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
        "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
        "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
        "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
        "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
        "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
        "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
        "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
        "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
        "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
        "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
        "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
        "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
        "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
        "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
        "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
        "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
        "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
        "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
        "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
        "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
        "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
        "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",

                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",

                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",

                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",

                "From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
                "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B.",
                "This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3).",
                "That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0.",
                "The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even.",
                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
                "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
                "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
                "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",

                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",

                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",

                "A <br>dpm</br> acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a <br>dpm</br> offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a <br>dpm</br> can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The <br>dpm</br> price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic <br>dpm</br>, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (<br>dpm</br>).",
                "A <br>dpm</br> can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A <br>dpm</br> is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A <br>dpm</br> has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A <br>dpm</br> is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "<br>dpm</br> prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",

                "A reasonable price function can be derived from the constraint (8) employed in Section 4.2.2, where we require that the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered.",
                "That is, p1/p2 = M1/M2.",

                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
                "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
                "When all money is redistributed (<br>dpm</br> II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of <br>dpm</br> over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for <br>dpm</br> II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for <br>dpm</br> I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central <br>dpm</br>.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the <br>dpm</br> market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for <br>dpm</br> I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of <br>dpm</br> I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either <br>dpm</br> formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (<br>dpm</br>).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a <br>dpm</br> in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a <br>dpm</br>: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",

                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",

                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that <br>dpm</br> may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as <br>hybrid</br> between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a <br>hybrid</br> between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",
                "Denote the two outcomes A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive.",
                "Denote the instantaneous price per share of A as p1 and the price per share of B as p2.",
                "Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively.",
                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",
                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
                "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",
                "For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation.",
                "Denote M1 as the total amount of money wagered on A, M2 as the total amount of money wagered on B, T = M1 + M2 as the total amount of money wagered on both sides, N1 as the total number of shares purchased of A, and N2 as the total number of shares purchased of B.",
                "There are many ways to formulate the price function.",
                "Several natural price functions are outlined below; each is motivated as the unique solution to a particular constraint on price dynamics. 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages To my knowledge, a DPM is the only known mechanism for hedging and speculating that exhibits all three of the following properties: (1) guaranteed liquidity, (2) no risk for the market institution, and (3) continuous incorporation of information.",
                "A standard pari-mutuel fails (3).",
                "A CDA fails (1).",

                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
                "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",

                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a <br>continuous double auction</br> (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the <br>continuous double auction</br> (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the <br>continuous double auction</br> (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",

                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",

                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",

                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",

                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",

                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",

                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",

                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",

                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",

                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",

                "A reasonable price function can be derived from the constraint (8) employed in Section 4.2.2, where we require that the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered.",
                "That is, p1/p2 = M1/M2.",
                "In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B. 176 Using Equations 3, 8, and 15 we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Interestingly, this is the same market probability derived in Section 4.2.1 for the case of losing-money redistribution with the constraints that the price of A equal the payoff of B and vice versa.",
                "The instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares is: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the number of shares n that can be purchased for m dollars, as follows: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) .",
                "Note that we solved for n(m) rather than m(n).",
                "I could not find a closed-form solution for m(n), as was derived for the two other cases above.",
                "Still, n(m) can be used to determine how many shares can be purchased for m dollars, and the inverse function can be approximated to any degree numerically.",
                "From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
                "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B.",
                "This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3).",
                "That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0.",
                "The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even.",
                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
                "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
                "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",

                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",

                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",

                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",

                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",

                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",

                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",

                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",

                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the <br>market institution</br> and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the <br>market institution</br>.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",

                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the <br>market institution</br>, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",

                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the <br>market institution</br> (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the <br>market institution</br> itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",

                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",

                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",

                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to <br>event resolution</br>.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",
                "Denote the two outcomes A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive.",

                "Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively.",
                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",

                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",

                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",

                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",

                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",

                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",

                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in <br>gain</br>s or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure a<br>gain</br>st undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",

                "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
                "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her <br>gain</br>s.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging a<br>gain</br>st, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their <br>gain</br>s or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",

                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",

                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",

                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",

                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",

                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",

                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",

                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",

                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",

                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",

                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",

                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",

                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",

                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",

                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",

                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",

                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",

                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",

                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",

                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",

                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",

                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",

                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",

                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",

                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",

                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",

                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",

                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",

                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",

                "The instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares is: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the number of shares n that can be purchased for m dollars, as follows: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) .",
                "Note that we solved for n(m) rather than m(n).",
                "I could not find a closed-form solution for m(n), as was derived for the two other cases above.",
                "Still, n(m) can be used to determine how many shares can be purchased for m dollars, and the inverse function can be approximated to any degree numerically.",
                "From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
                "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B.",
                "This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3).",
                "That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0.",
                "The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even.",
                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
                "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
                "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an <br>automated market maker</br> willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",

                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",

                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",

                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",

                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor <br>demand</br>.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",

                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",

                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",

                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",

                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",

The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",

                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the <br>price</br> is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the <br>price</br> is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",

                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",

                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",

                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",

                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",

                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",

                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",

                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",

                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",

                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",

                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/<br>combinatorial bet</br>ting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the <br>trade</br>.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",

                "The instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares is: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the number of shares n that can be purchased for m dollars, as follows: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) .",
                "Note that we solved for n(m) rather than m(n).",
                "I could not find a closed-form solution for m(n), as was derived for the two other cases above.",
                "Still, n(m) can be used to determine how many shares can be purchased for m dollars, and the inverse function can be approximated to any degree numerically.",
                "From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
                "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B.",
                "This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3).",
                "That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0.",
                "The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even.",
                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
                "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
                "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",

                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",

                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",

                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to <br>hedge</br> risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",

                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a <br>hedge</br> for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",

                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",

                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",

                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",

                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",

                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",

                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a <br>bet</br> on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who <br>bet</br> on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who <br>bet</br> on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are <br>bet</br> on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who <br>bet</br> on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money <br>bet</br> on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount <br>bet</br>.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is <br>bet</br> on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar <br>bet</br> in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular <br>bet</br>, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to <br>bet</br> early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their <br>bet</br>, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to <br>bet</br> until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a <br>bet</br> that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a <br>bet</br> that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that <br>bet</br> are fixed at the time of the <br>bet</br>.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the <br>bet</br>, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the <br>bet</br>; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a <br>bet</br> is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",
                "Denote the two outcomes A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive.",
                "Denote the instantaneous price per share of A as p1 and the price per share of B as p2.",
                "Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively.",
                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",
                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
                "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",
                "For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation.",
                "Denote M1 as the total amount of money wagered on A, M2 as the total amount of money wagered on B, T = M1 + M2 as the total amount of money wagered on both sides, N1 as the total number of shares purchased of A, and N2 as the total number of shares purchased of B.",
                "There are many ways to formulate the price function.",
                "Several natural price functions are outlined below; each is motivated as the unique solution to a particular constraint on price dynamics. 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages To my knowledge, a DPM is the only known mechanism for hedging and speculating that exhibits all three of the following properties: (1) guaranteed liquidity, (2) no risk for the market institution, and (3) continuous incorporation of information.",
                "A standard pari-mutuel fails (3).",
                "A CDA fails (1).",
                "A CDAwMM, the bookmaker mechanism, and an MSR all fail (2).",
                "Even though technically an MSR exposes its patron to risk (i.e., a variable future payoff), the patrons maximum loss is bounded, so the distinction between a DPM and an MSR in terms of these three properties is more technical than practical.",

                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",

                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",

                "From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
                "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B.",
                "This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3).",
                "That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0.",
                "The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even.",
                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
                "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
                "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
