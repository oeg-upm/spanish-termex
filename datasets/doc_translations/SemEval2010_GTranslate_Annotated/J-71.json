Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM). A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both. Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution. The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share. The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand. Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in. I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.

INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events. The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM). The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker. Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism. Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct. Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets. These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting. Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders. A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution. But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin. A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders. A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses. Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available. As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well. Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker. Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers. However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close. For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information. Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed. Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings. In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM). A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA. A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk). A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market. The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation. A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution. A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA. The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering. If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases. Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired. The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs. DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed. While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism. Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games. In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future. After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered. More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered. That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered. An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars. In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet. Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B. The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B. Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race). People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total. People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees). Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25. Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed. The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome. As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available. Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen. Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes. So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates. This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed. Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close. However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM. If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1. Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss. Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying. A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker. In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk. The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time. It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios. There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high). Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging. Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics. But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market. Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market. This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market. In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17]. A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common. The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA). The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible. Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16]. Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes. So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs. In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur. Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down. In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14]. Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19]. A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell. If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask). If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur. In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset. Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk. However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade. As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs. The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices. We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades. The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm. Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk. Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA. In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes. Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet. The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread. While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM. One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker. Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand. Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk. Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM. Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price. An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market. The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded. An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events. At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution. In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution. In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate. Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity. An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system. An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker. In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close. While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar. Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes. The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently. The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3. A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase. So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A. A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other. Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur. The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome. There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds. For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward. Denote the two outcomes A and B. The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive. Denote the instantaneous price per share of A as p1 and the price per share of B as p2. Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively. These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand. Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed. At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B). However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each. These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2. For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation. Denote M1 as the total amount of money wagered on A, M2 as the total amount of money wagered on B, T = M1 + M2 as the total amount of money wagered on both sides, N1 as the total number of shares purchased of A, and N2 as the total number of shares purchased of B. There are many ways to formulate the price function. Several natural price functions are outlined below; each is motivated as the unique solution to a particular constraint on price dynamics. 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages To my knowledge, a DPM is the only known mechanism for hedging and speculating that exhibits all three of the following properties: (1) guaranteed liquidity, (2) no risk for the market institution, and (3) continuous incorporation of information. A standard pari-mutuel fails (3). A CDA fails (1). A CDAwMM, the bookmaker mechanism, and an MSR all fail (2). Even though technically an MSR exposes its patron to risk (i.e., a variable future payoff), the patrons maximum loss is bounded, so the distinction between a DPM and an MSR in terms of these three properties is more technical than practical. DPM traders can cash out of the market early, just like stock market traders, to lock in a profit or limit a loss, an action that is simply not possible in a standard pari-mutuel. A DPM also has some drawbacks. The payoff for a wager depends both on the price at the time of the trade, and on the final payoff per share at the markets close. This contrasts with the CDA variants, where the payoff vector across possible future outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade. So a traders strategic optimization problem is complicated by the need to predict the final values of P1 and P2. If P changes according to a random walk, then traders can take the current P as an unbiased estimate of the final P, greatly decreasing the complexity of their optimization. If P does not change according to a random walk, the mechanism still has utility as a mechanism for hedging and speculating, though optimization may be difficult, and determining a measure of the markets aggregate opinion of the probabilities of A and B may be difficult. We discuss the implications of random walk behavior further below in Section 4.1 in the discussion surrounding Assumption 3. A second drawback of a DPM is its one-sided nature. 173 While an automated market maker always stands ready to accept buy orders, there is no corresponding market maker to accept sell orders. Traders must sell to each other using a standard CDA mechanism, for example by posting an ask order at a price at or below the market makers current ask price. Traders can also always hedge-sell by purchasing shares in the opposite outcome from the market maker, thereby hedging their bet if not fully liquidating it. 3.3 Redistribution rule In a standard pari-mutuel market, payoffs can be computed in either of two equivalent ways: (1) each winning $1 wager receives a refund of the initial $1 paid, plus an equal share of all losing wagers, or (2) each winning $1 wager receives an equal share of all wagers, winning or losing. Because each dollar always earns an equal share of the payoff, the two formulations are precisely the same: $1 + Mlose Mwin = Mwin + Mlose Mwin . In a dynamic pari-mutuel market, because each dollar is not equally weighted, the two formulations are distinct, and lead to significantly different price functions and mechanisms, each with different potentially desirable properties. We consider each case in turn. The next section analyzes case (1), where only losing money is redistributed. Section 5 examines case (2), where all money is redistributed. 4. DPM I: LOSING MONEY REDISTRIBUTED For the case where the initial payments on winning bets are refunded, and only losing money is redistributed, the respective payoffs per share are simply: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2 . So, if A occurs, shareholders of A receive all of their initial payment back, plus P1 dollars per share owned, while shareholders of B lose all money wagered. Similarly, if B occurs, shareholders of B receive all of their initial payment back, plus P2 dollars per share owned, while shareholders of A lose all money wagered. Without loss of generality, I will analyze the market from the perspective of A, deriving prices and payoffs for A only. The equations for B are symmetric. The traders per-share expected value for purchasing an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A is E[ shares] = Pr(A) Â· E [P1|A] âˆ’ (1 âˆ’ Pr(A)) Â· p1 E[ shares] = Pr(A) Â· E Â» M2 N1 Ë› Ë› Ë› Ë› A âˆ’ (1 âˆ’ Pr(A)) Â· p1 where is an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A, Pr(A) is the traders belief in the probability of A, and p1 is the instantaneous price per share of A for an infinitesimal quantity of shares. E[P1|A] is the traders expectation of the payoff per share of A after the market closes and given that A occurs. This is a subtle point. The value of P1 does not matter if B occurs, since in this case shares of A are worthless, and the current value of P1 does not necessarily matter as this may change as trading continues. So, in order to determine the expected value of shares of A, the trader must estimate what he or she expects the payoff per share to be in the end (after the market closes) if A occurs. If E[ shares]/ > 0, a risk-neutral trader should purchase shares of A. How many shares? This depends on the price function determining p1. In general, p1 increases as more shares are purchased. The risk-neutral trader should continue purchasing shares until E[ shares]/ = 0. (A riskaverse trader will generally stop purchasing shares before driving E[ shares]/ all the way to zero.) Assuming riskneutrality, the traders optimization problem is to choose a number of shares n â‰¥ 0 of A to purchase, in order to maximize E[n shares] = Pr(A)Â·nÂ·E [P1|A]âˆ’(1âˆ’Pr(A))Â· Z n 0 p1(n)dn. (1) Its easy to see that the same value of n can be solved for by finding the number of shares required to drive E[ shares]/ to zero. That is, find n â‰¥ 0 satisfying 0 = Pr(A) Â· E [P1|A] âˆ’ (1 âˆ’ Pr(A)) Â· p1(n), if such a n exists, otherwise n = 0. 4.1 Market probability As traders who believe that E[ shares of A]/ > 0 purchase shares of A and traders who believe that E[ shares of B]/ > 0 purchase shares of B, the prices p1 and p2 change according to a price function, as prescribed below. The current prices in a sense reflect the markets opinion as a whole of the relative probabilities of A and B. Assuming an efficient marketplace, the market as a whole considers E[ shares]/ = 0, since the mechanisms is a zero sum game. For example, if market participants in aggregate felt that E[ shares]/ > 0, then there would be net demand for A, driving up the price of A until E[ shares]/ = 0. Define MPr(A) to be the market probability of A, or the probability of A inferred by assuming that E[ shares]/ = 0. We can consider MPr(A) to be the aggregate probability of A as judged by the market as a whole. MPr(A) is the solution to 0 = MPr(A) Â· E[P1|A] âˆ’ (1 âˆ’ MPr(A)) Â· p1. Solving we get MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) At this point we make a critical assumption in order to greatly simplify the analysis; we assume that E[P1|A] = P1. (3) That is, we assume that the current value for the payoff per share of A is the same as the expected final value of the payoff per share of A given that A occurs. This is certainly true for the last (infinitesimal) wager before the market closes. Its not obvious, however, that the assumption is true well before the markets close. Basically, we are assuming that the value of P1 moves according to an unbiased random walk: the current value of P1 is the best expectation of its future value. I conjecture that there are reasonable market efficiency conditions under which assumption (3) is true, though I have not been able to prove that it arises naturally from rational trading. We examine scenarios below in which 174 assumption (3) seems especially plausible. Nonetheless, the assumption effects our analysis only. Regardless of whether (3) is true, each price function derived below implies a welldefined zero-sum game in which traders can play. If traders can assume that (3) is true, then their optimization problem (1) is greatly simplified; however, optimizing (1) does not depend on the assumption, and traders can still optimize by strategically projecting the final expected payoff in whatever complicated way they desire. So, the utility of DPM for hedging and speculating does not necessarily hinge on the truth of assumption (3). On the other hand, the ability to easily infer an aggregate market consensus probability from market prices does depend on (3). 4.2 Price functions A variety of price functions seem reasonable, each exhibiting various properties, and implying differing market probabilities. 4.2.1 Price function I: Price of A equals payoff of B One natural price function to consider is to set the price per share of A equal to the payoff per share of B, and set the price per share of B equal to the payoff per share of A. That is, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Enforcing this relationship reduces the dimensionality of the system from four to two, simplifying the interface: traders need only track two numbers instead of four. The relationship makes sense, since new information supporting A should encourage purchasing of shares A, driving up both the price of A and the payoff of B, and driving down the price of B and the payoff of A. In this setting, assumption (3) seems especially reasonable, since if an efficient market hypothesis leads prices to follow a random walk, than payoffs must also follow a random walk. The constraints (4) lead to the following derivation of the market probability: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) The constraints (4) specify the instantaneous relationship between payoff and price. From this, we can derive how prices change when (non-infinitesimal) shares are purchased. Let n be the number of shares purchased and let m be the amount of money spent purchasing n shares. Note that p1 = dm/dn, the instantaneous price per share, and m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Substituting into equation (4), we get: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 âˆ’ 1 i (6) Equation 6 gives the cost of purchasing n shares. The instantaneous price per share as a function of n is p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2 . (7) Note that p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 as required. The derivation of the price function p2(n) for B is analogous and the results are symmetric. The notion of buying infinitesimal shares, or integrating costs over a continuous function, are probably foreign to most traders. A more standard interface can be implemented by discretizing the costs into round lots of shares, for example lots of 100 shares. Then ask orders of 100 shares each at the appropriate price can be automatically placed by the market institution. For example, the market institution can place an ask order for 100 shares at price m(100)/100, another ask order for 100 shares at price (m(200)âˆ’m(100))/100, a third ask for 100 shares at (m(300)âˆ’ m(200))/100, etc. In this way, the market looks more familiar to traders, like a typical CDA with a number of ask orders at various prices automatically available. A trader buying less than 100 shares would pay a bit more than if the true cost were computed using (6), but the discretized interface would probably be more intuitive and transparent to the majority of traders. The above equations assume that all money that comes in is eventually returned or redistributed. In other words, the mechanism is a zero sum game, and the market institution takes no portion of the money. This could be generalized so that the market institution always takes a certain amount, or a certain percent, or a certain amount per transaction, or a certain percent per transaction, before money in returned or redistributed. Finally, note that the above price function is undefined when the amount bet or the number of shares are zero. So the system must begin with some positive amount on both sides, and some positive number of shares outstanding on both sides. These initial amounts can be arbitrarily small in principle, but the size of the initial subsidy may affect the incentives of traders to participate. Also, the smaller the initial amounts, the more each new dollar effects the prices. The initialization amounts could be funded as a subsidy from the market institution or a patron, which Ill call a seed wager, or from a portion of the fees charged, which Ill call an ante wager. 4.2.2 Price function II: Price of A proportional to money on A A second price function can be derived by requiring the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered. 175 That is, p1 p2 = M1 M2 . (8) In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B. This seems like a particularly natural way to set the price, since the more money that is wagered on one side, the cheaper becomes a share on the other side, in exactly the same proportion. Using Equation 8, along with (2) and (3), we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) Â· M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) Â· M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 Â· M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 âˆš N1 M2 âˆš N2 MPr(A) = M1 âˆš N1 M1 âˆš N1 + M2 âˆš N2 (9) We can solve for the instantaneous price as follows: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) Â· P1 = M1 âˆš N1 M2 âˆš N2 Â· M2 N1 = M1 âˆš N1N2 (10) Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the implied cost function m as a function of the number n of shares purchased as follows: dm dn = M1 + m âˆš N1 + n âˆš N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn âˆš N1 + n âˆš N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 âˆ’2 r N1 N2 âˆ’ 1 # . (11) From this we get the price function: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 âˆ’2 r N1 N2 . (12) Note that, as required, p1(0) = M1/ âˆš N1N2, and p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B, which seems fairly natural. Note that, as before, the mechanism can be modified to collect transaction fees of some kind. Also note that seed or ante wagers are required to initialize the system. 5. DPM II: ALL MONEY REDISTRIBUTED Above we examined the policy of refunding winning wagers and redistributing only losing wagers. In this section we consider the second policy mentioned in Section 3.3: all money from all wagers are collected and redistributed to winning wagers. For the case where all money is redistributed, the respective payoffs per share are: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2 , where T = M1 + M2 is the total amount of money wagered on both sides. So, if A occurs, shareholders of A lose their initial price paid, but receive P1 dollars per share owned; shareholders of B simply lose all money wagered. Similarly, if B occurs, shareholders of B lose their initial price paid, but receive P2 dollars per share owned; shareholders of A lose all money wagered. In this case, the traders per-share expected value for purchasing an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A is E[ shares] = Pr(A) Â· E [P1|A] âˆ’ p1. (13) A risk-neutral trader optimizes by choosing a number of shares n â‰¥ 0 of A to purchase, in order to maximize E[n shares] = Pr(A) Â· n Â· E [P1|A] âˆ’ Z n 0 p1(n)dn = Pr(A) Â· n Â· E [P1|A] âˆ’ m (14) The same value of n can be solved for by finding the number of shares required to drive E[ shares]/ to zero. That is, find n â‰¥ 0 satisfying 0 = Pr(A) Â· E [P1|A] âˆ’ p1(n), if such a n exists, otherwise n = 0. 5.1 Market probability In this case MPr(A), the aggregate probability of A as judged by the market as a whole, is the solution to 0 = MPr(A) Â· E[P1|A] âˆ’ p1. Solving we get MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) As before, we make the simplifying assumption (3) that the expected final payoff per share equals the current payoff per share. The assumption is critical for our analysis, but may not be required for a practical implementation. 5.2 Price functions For the case where all money is distributed, the constraints (4) that keep the price of A equal to the payoff of B, and vice versa, do not lead to the derivation of a coherent price function. A reasonable price function can be derived from the constraint (8) employed in Section 4.2.2, where we require that the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered. That is, p1/p2 = M1/M2. In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B. 176 Using Equations 3, 8, and 15 we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) Â· T N1 Â· N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) Â· N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Interestingly, this is the same market probability derived in Section 4.2.1 for the case of losing-money redistribution with the constraints that the price of A equal the payoff of B and vice versa. The instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares is: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the number of shares n that can be purchased for m dollars, as follows: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) Â· Â· Â· n = m(N1 âˆ’ N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln Â» T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Note that we solved for n(m) rather than m(n). I could not find a closed-form solution for m(n), as was derived for the two other cases above. Still, n(m) can be used to determine how many shares can be purchased for m dollars, and the inverse function can be approximated to any degree numerically. From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 âˆ’ m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln Â» T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B. This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3). That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0. The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even. The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs. This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7. When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff. Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7. On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money. Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome. From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks. One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome. At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price. Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6. OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = Î±M1 and p2 = Î±M2, where Î± > 0. In this case, prices would only go up. For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome. Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket. I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above. Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists. Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7. AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss. This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker. So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker. Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price. Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple. In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism. Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares. New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader. In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket. However, an aftermarket is still possible. In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue. In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise. One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components. However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM. In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets. The bundling mechanism works as follows. Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1. A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1. The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dollars. If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket. The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling. Consider a share of A purchased for $5. The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A. Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit. The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A. The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff. So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment. The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains. Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share. The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2. The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers price refunded). The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 Â· 1A. The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5. If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3. Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8. CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM). The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation. To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties. An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics. Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased. The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price. I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed. Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions. I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9. FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market. Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture. The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis. Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when? How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests. This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism. However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment. In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market. I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time. The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables. I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100). However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting. I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task. DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen. Acknowledgments I thank Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow, and Robin Hanson. 10. REFERENCES [1] Mukhtar M.

    "original_translation": "Un mercado dinÃ¡mico pari-mutuel para cobertura, apuesta y agregaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n David M. Pennock Yahoo! Investigation Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 EE. UU. Pennockd@yahoo-inc.com Resumen I Desarrollar un nuevo mecanismo para la asignaciÃ³n de riesgos y la especulaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n llamada mercado dinÃ¡mico Pari-Mutuel (DPM). Un DPM actÃºa como hÃ­brido entre un mercado pari-mutuel y una subasta doble continua (CDA), heredando algunas de las ventajas de ambos. Al igual que un mercado pari-mutuel, un DPM ofrece una liquidez infinita de aceptaciÃ³n y un riesgo cero para la instituciÃ³n del mercado;Al igual que un CDA, un DPM puede reaccionar continuamente a la nueva informaciÃ³n, incorporar dinÃ¡micamente informaciÃ³n a los precios y permitir a los comerciantes bloquear las ganancias o limitar las pÃ©rdidas vendiendo antes de la resoluciÃ³n de eventos. La interfaz del comerciante se puede diseÃ±ar para imitar el formato de subasta doble familiar con colas de oferta de oferta, aunque con una variable de adiciÃ³n llamada recompensa por acciÃ³n. La funciÃ³n de precio de DPM se puede ver como un fabricante de mercado automatizado que siempre ofrece vender a algÃºn precio y mover el precio de manera adecuada segÃºn la demanda. Dado que el mecanismo es pari-mutuel (es decir, redistributivo), se garantiza que pagarÃ¡ exactamente la cantidad de dinero tomado. Exploro una serie de variaciones en el DPM bÃ¡sico, analizando las propiedades de cada una y resolviendo en forma cerrada para sus respectivas funciones de precios. CategorÃ­as y descriptores de sujetos J.4 [Aplicaciones informÃ¡ticas]: Ciencias sociales y conductuales-economÃ­a Algoritmos de tÃ©rminos generales, diseÃ±o, economÃ­a, teorÃ­a.1. IntroducciÃ³n Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuesta para apoyar la cobertura (es decir, asegurar) contra la exposiciÃ³n a eventos inciertos y/o comercio especulativo en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en los cÃ­rculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos el CDA con el fabricante de mercado (CDAWMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o un apuestas de apuestas, que esencialmente actÃºa exactamente como fabricante de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de Jai alai emplean tradicionalmente el mecanismo pari-mutuel. Aunque no existe una separaciÃ³n formal o lÃ³gica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, los dos esfuerzos se consideran socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDA o CDAWMM para todo tipo de apuestas, incluso en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos polÃ­ticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultÃ¡nea y opuesta para usar sistemas de apuestas para apostarmercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y desdibujan aÃºn mÃ¡s la lÃ­nea entre la inversiÃ³n y las apuestas. Algunas compaÃ±Ã­as a la vanguardia de estos movimientos estÃ¡n creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria que declaran el inicio de una revoluciÃ³n en el negocio de apuestas.1 Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la instituciÃ³n de mercado y los comerciantes participantes. Un CDA solo coincide con los comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningÃºn riesgo para la instituciÃ³n del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir la iliquidez en la forma enormes spreads de oferta de ofertas o incluso colas vacÃ­as de ofertas de ofertas si el comercio es ligero y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de pollo y huevo: los comerciantes se sienten atraÃ­dos por los mercados lÃ­quidos, pero los mercados lÃ­quidos requieren una gran cantidad de comerciantes. Un CDAWMM y el mecanismo de apuestas similar tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el fabricante de mercado, generalmente afiliado a la instituciÃ³n del mercado, estÃ¡ expuesto al riesgo significativo de grandes pÃ©rdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAWMM ofrecen incentivos para que los operadores aprovechen la informaciÃ³n continuamente tan pronto como esa informaciÃ³n estÃ© disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan el estado actual de la informaciÃ³n excepcionalmente bien. Los mercados de pari-mutuel tienen una liquidez infinita: cualquiera puede apostar en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin la necesidad de una oferta de correspondencia de otro apostador o un fabricante de mercado. Los mercados pari-mutuel tambiÃ©n implican ningÃºn riesgo para la instituciÃ³n del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de perder apuestas a apuestas ganadoras. Sin embargo, Pari-Mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets no es adecuado para situaciones en las que la informaciÃ³n llega con el tiempo, ya que hay un fuerte desincentivo para colocarseApuestas hasta que (1) se revele toda la informaciÃ³n, o (2) el mercado estÃ¡ a punto de cerrar. Por esta razÃ³n, los precios pari-mutuel antes del cierre de los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la informaciÃ³n actual. Los participantes del mercado pari-mutuel no pueden comprar y vender altos: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar las pÃ©rdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Debido a que el proceso mediante el cual la informaciÃ³n llega continuamente a lo largo del tiempo es la regla mÃ¡s que la excepciÃ³n, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo de pari-mutuel estÃ¡ndar es cuestionable en una gran cantidad de configuraciones. En este documento, desarrollar un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulaciÃ³n y apuesta, llamado mercado dinÃ¡mico parimutuel (DPM). Se puede considerar que un DPM es un hÃ­brido entre un mercado pari-mutuel y un CDA. Un DPM es de verdad en la naturaleza pari-mutul, lo que significa que actÃºa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos comerciantes a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la instituciÃ³n del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y predeterminado para comenzar el mercado. En principio, el subsidio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeÃ±o y posiblemente provenir de comerciantes (a travÃ©s de antes o tarifas de transacciÃ³n) en lugar de la instituciÃ³n del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial puede fomentar el comercio y la agregaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado pari-mutuel: los comerciantes siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a algÃºn precio establecido automÃ¡ticamente por la instituciÃ³n del mercado. Un DPM tambiÃ©n puede reaccionar e incorporar informaciÃ³n que llegue con el tiempo, como un CDA. La instituciÃ³n del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basados en el estado actual de apuestas. Si un resultado particular recibe una cantidad relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta;Si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automÃ¡ticamente utilizando una funciÃ³n de precio, que puede diferir dependiendo de quÃ© propiedades se deseen. La funciÃ³n de precio determina el precio instantÃ¡neo por acciÃ³n para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones;El costo total de compras n acciones se calcula como la integral de la funciÃ³n de precio de 0 a n.La complejidad de la funciÃ³n de precio se puede ocultar a los comerciantes comunicando solo los precios de solicitud de varias lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, muchas 100 acciones), al igual que la prÃ¡ctica comÃºn en CDA y CDAWMMS. Los precios de DPM reflejan la informaciÃ³n actual, y los operadores pueden cobrar en un posventa para obtener ganancias o limitar las pÃ©rdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Si bien siempre hay un fabricante de mercado dispuesto a aceptar Ã³rdenes de compra, no hay un fabricante de mercado que acepte Ã³rdenes de venta y, por lo tanto, no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en cambio, la venta se realiza a travÃ©s de un mecanismo CDA estÃ¡ndar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden vender de cobertura comprando el resultado opuesto de lo que ya poseen.2. Antecedentes y trabajo relacionado 2.1 mercados Pari-Mutueles Pari-Mutuel Los mercados son comunes en las carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], las carreras de perros y los juegos de Jai Alai. En un mercado pari-Mutuel, las personas colocan apuestas sobre cuÃ¡les se producirÃ¡n dos o mÃ¡s resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos en algÃºn momento en el futuro. DespuÃ©s de que se conoce el verdadero resultado, todo el dinero que pierde aquellos que apostan por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apuestan por el resultado correcto, en proporciÃ³n directa a la cantidad que se apoderaron. MÃ¡s formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, K caballos, exactamente uno de los cuales ganarÃ¡), y M1, M2 ,..., Los dÃ³lares de MK son apuestas en cada resultado, y el resultado que ocurre, luego todos los que apostan por un resultado j = yo pierde su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostarÃ¡n por el resultado recibo PK J = 1 mJ/Mi dÃ³lares por cada dÃ³lar que se apostaron. Es decir, cada dÃ³lar apostaron que recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero que se apostaron. Una forma equivalente de pensar sobre la regla de redistribuciÃ³n es que cada dÃ³lar se reembolsa en I es reembolsado, luego recibe una parte igual de todos los dinero restantes en los resultados perdedores, o p j = i mj/mi dÃ³lares. En la prÃ¡ctica, la instituciÃ³n de mercado (por ejemplo, la pista de carreras) primero toma un cierto porcentaje de la cantidad total que se apostaron, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, luego redistribuye cualquier dinero que quede a los ganadores en proporciÃ³n a su cantidad de apuesta. Considere un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que PR (A âˆ§ B) = 0 y PR (A) + PR (B) = 1. Supongamos que $ 800 se apuesta por A y $ 200 en B. Ahora suponga que se produce A (por ejemplo, Horse A gana la carrera). Las personas que se apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $ 200 en total. Las personas que se apostaron por una victoria y cada una recibe una proporciÃ³n proporcional del total de $ 1000 apostar (ignorando las tarifas). EspecÃ­ficamente, cada apuesta de $ 1 en un derecho a su propietario una acciÃ³n de 1/800 de los $ 1000, o $ 1.25. Cada apuesta en dÃ³lares en un mercado pari-mutuel tiene una pago igual, independientemente de cuÃ¡ndo se colocÃ³ la apuesta o cuÃ¡nto dinero se invirtiÃ³ en los diversos resultados en el momento en que se colocÃ³ la apuesta. El Ãºnico estado que importa es el estado final: las cantidades finales se apostaron por todos los resultados cuando el mercado se cierra y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para hacer una apuesta temprano si existe alguna posibilidad de que estÃ© disponible una nueva informaciÃ³n. AdemÃ¡s, no hay garantÃ­as sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que no serÃ¡ negativo si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de pago pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que se cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razÃ³n para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas finales de pago. Esto contrasta con CDA y CDAWMMS, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revela nueva informaciÃ³n. Se puede permitir que los apostadores pari-mutuel cambien su resultado elegido, o incluso cancele su apuesta, antes del cierre de los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden cobrar el mercado temprano, ya sea para bloquear ganancias o limitar las pÃ©rdidas, si la nueva informaciÃ³n favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAWMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un posventa para vender apuestas existentes no es sensato: cada dÃ³lar apostar vale exactamente $ 1 hasta que los mercados cierran, no uno comprarÃ­a a mÃ¡s de $ 1 y nadie se venderÃ­a a menos de $ 1. Los apostadores pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para obtener cualquier ganancia o pÃ©rdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado pari-mutuel, cualquiera puede apostar a cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento, en cierto sentido hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAWMM tambiÃ©n tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el fabricante del mercado. En un mercado pari-mutuel, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la instituciÃ³n de mercado en sÃ­ no tiene riesgo. El principal inconveniente de un mercado pari-mutuel es que es Ãºtil solo para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en algÃºn instante en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que llega la informaciÃ³n con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado de las situaciones de activos comunes en AL171, la mayorÃ­a de los escenarios comerciales y de apuestas. No hay nociÃ³n de comprar bajos y vender altas, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos estÃ¡n comprando (y el precio es bajo) es recompensado mÃ¡s que comprar cuando muchos otros estÃ¡n comprando (y el precio es alto). QuizÃ¡s por esta razÃ³n, en la mayorÃ­a de los entornos dinÃ¡micos, los mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real a la informaciÃ³n cambiante se emplean mÃ¡s tÃ­picamente para facilitar la especulaciÃ³n y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado pari-mutuel puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado repetido pari-mutuel, donde se ejecutan distintos mercados de pari-mutuel a intervalos consecutivos, podrÃ­a en principio capturar la dinÃ¡mica de informaciÃ³n cambiante. Pero ejecutar mÃºltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente disminuirÃ­a el comercio en cada mercado individual. AdemÃ¡s, en cada mercado individual de pari-mutuel, los incentivos aÃºn serÃ­an esperar para apostar hasta justo antes del tiempo final de ese mercado en particular. Este Ãºltimo problema podrÃ­a mitigarse instituyendo una regla de detenciÃ³n aleatoria para cada mercado individual de pari-mutuel. En los experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de pari-mutuel han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir informaciÃ³n dispersa entre los comerciantes, al menos para una sola instantÃ¡nea en el tiempo [17]. Se ha reconocido una habilidad similar en las carreras reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26].2.2 Los mercados financieros en el mundo financiero, las apuestas sobre los resultados de las proposiciones futuras inciertas tambiÃ©n es comÃºn. El mecanismo de mercado tÃ­pico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El tÃ©rmino mercado de valores en economÃ­a y finanzas abarca genÃ©ricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Los ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE [13], mercados de futuros como el CME [21], otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados de valores polÃ­ticos [6, 7], mercados de futuros de ideas [12], mercados de decisiones, mercados de decisiones.[10] e incluso juegos de mercado [3, 15, 16]. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor econÃ³mico y social mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de facilitar la especulaciÃ³n o las apuestas: permiten a los comerciantes cubrir el riesgo o asegurarse contra resultados indeseables. Entonces, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, puede mitigar el riesgo apostando el resultado, para organizar una compensaciÃ³n en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automÃ³vil es efectivamente una apuesta de que ocurrirÃ¡ un accidente u otro evento cubierto. Del mismo modo, comprar una opciÃ³n de venta, que es Ãºtil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta de que las acciones subyacentes disminuirÃ¡n. En la prÃ¡ctica, los agentes participan en una mezcla de cobertura y especulaciÃ³n, y no hay una lÃ­nea divisoria clara entre los dos [14]. Al igual que los mercados pari-mutuel, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de informaciÃ³n, que producen pronÃ³sticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA coincide constantemente con los pedidos de comprar un activo con Ã³rdenes para vender. Si en algÃºn momento una parte estÃ¡ dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta de PBID, mientras que otra parte estÃ¡ dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de solicitaciÃ³n de Pask, y PBID es mayor o igual a Pask, luego las dos partes transacciones (a algÃºn precio entre PBID y Pask). Si el precio de oferta mÃ¡s alto es menor que el precio de solicitud mÃ¡s bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y solicitaciÃ³n cambian rÃ¡pidamente a medida que llega la nueva informaciÃ³n y los comerciantes reevalÃºan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo coincide con los postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningÃºn riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estÃ¡n dispuestos a vender;Para que ocurra cualquier transacciÃ³n, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesto a aceptar el comercio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en un CDA, puede volverse ilÃ­quido, lo que significa que no se produce mucha actividad comercial. El diferencial entre el precio de oferta mÃ¡s alto y el precio de solicitud mÃ¡s bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacÃ­as, desanimando el comercio.2 Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar a un fabricante de mercado que estÃ© dispuesto a aceptar un gran nÃºmerode compra y venta de pedidos a precios particulares. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con Market Maker (CDAWMM) .3 Conceptualmente, el fabricante de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero generalmente estÃ¡ dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El fabricante de mercado puede ser una persona, o puede ser un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un fabricante de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al fabricante del mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo las operaciones coincidentes, el sistema realmente asume el riesgo de su propio, y dependiendo de lo que sucede en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero.2.3 Mercados de apuestas La apuesta tÃ­pica de Las Vegas Funciones o del fabricante de probabilidades como un fabricante de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la instituciÃ³n de mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, 4 inicialmente segÃºn la opiniÃ³n de expertos, y mÃ¡s tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas sobre los diversos resultados. A diferencia de un entorno pari-mutuel, cada vez que se coloca una apuesta con una casa de apuestas, las probabilidades o los tÃ©rminos para esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. La casa de apuestas se beneficia al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, esencialmente definiendo una extensiÃ³n de Bidask. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la informaciÃ³n cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada en las probabilidades previamente establecidas permanecen vigentes de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta;Esto estÃ¡ precisamente en analogÃ­a con un CDAWMM. Una diferencia entre una casa de apuestas y un fabricante de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo Take It o Leave It: los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias Ã³rdenes lÃ­mite en una cola comÃºn, en realidad solo pueden colocar pedidos de mercado a precios definidos por la casa de apuestas. AÃºn asÃ­, la casa de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de apostadores. Al igual que un fabricante de mercado, la casa de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. TambiÃ©n se ha demostrado que los mercados de apuestas deportivas proporcionan pronÃ³sticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23].2.4 Regla de puntuaciÃ³n del mercado Hansons [11] Regla de puntuaciÃ³n del mercado (MSR) es un nuevo mecanismo para cubrir y especular que comparte algunas propiedades en comÃºn con un DPM. Al igual que un DPM, un MSR puede conceptualizarse como un fabricante de mercado automatizado que siempre estÃ¡ dispuesto a aceptar una operaciÃ³n en cualquier evento a algÃºn precio. Un MSR requiere un patrÃ³n para subsidiar el mercado. La pÃ©rdida final de los clientes es variable y, por lo tanto, tÃ©cnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pÃ©rdida mÃ¡xima estÃ¡ limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribuciÃ³n de probabilidad en todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, los 2 mercados delgados ocurren a menudo en la prÃ¡ctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://tradesports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo.3 Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAWMM es el mercado de apuestas interactivas en http://wsex.com.4 o, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la lÃ­nea del juego para proporcionar probabilidades de dinero uniforme.172 comerciante que cree que las probabilidades estÃ¡n mal pueden cambiar cualquier parte de la distribuciÃ³n aceptando un boleto de loterÃ­a que valga la pena de acuerdo con una regla de puntuaciÃ³n (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuaciÃ³n logarÃ­tmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese comerciante tambiÃ©n acepte pagarLa persona mÃ¡s reciente en cambiar la distribuciÃ³n. En el lÃ­mite de un solo comerciante, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuaciÃ³n, adecuada para encuestar a un solo agente para su distribuciÃ³n de probabilidad. En el lÃ­mite de muchos comerciantes, produce una estimaciÃ³n combinada. Dado que el mercado esencialmente siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los resultados posibles, el mecanismo evita el problema de los mercados delgados o la iliquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el patrÃ³n en general inyecta una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un fabricante de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un fabricante de mercado automatizado unilateral. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre los resultados se fija en el momento del comercio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos en los resultados depende tanto del estado de apuesta en el momento del comercio como del estado de apuestas en elLos mercados cierran. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, por lo que la aceptaciÃ³n y los incentivos del comerciante pueden diferir fuertemente, las propiedades y las motivaciones de DPM y MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cÃ³mo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un nÃºmero combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los clientes por subsidiar el comercio en todas las combinaciones posibles de N eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar a los n marginales de eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo fue planeado para su uso en el mercado de anÃ¡lisis de polÃ­ticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en los resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA [20], hasta que una tormenta de medios matÃ³ el proyecto.5 A partir de este escrito, los fundadores de PAM fueronconsiderando la reapertura bajo control privado.6 3. Una descripciÃ³n dinÃ¡mica del mercado pari-moutuel 3.1 de alto nivel en contraste con un mercado de pari-mutista estÃ¡ndar, donde cada dÃ³lar siempre compra una participaciÃ³n igual de la recompensa, en un dpm cada dÃ³lar compra una participaciÃ³n variable en el pago dependiendo del estado deapostar en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta en A en un momento en que la mayorÃ­a de los demÃ¡s se apuesta en B ofrece una ganancia mayor posible que una apuesta en A cuando la mayorÃ­a de los demÃ¡s tambiÃ©n se apuesta por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el pago cambiante de una apuesta es decir que, en un momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprarÃ¡ un cierto nÃºmero de acciones en un resultado del otro. Comprar una acciÃ³n da derecho a su propietario a una participaciÃ³n igual en la olla ganadora en caso de que ocurra el resultado elegido. La recompensa es variable, porque cuando pocas personas apostan por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serÃ¡n mÃ¡s baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas apostan a ese resultado. No existe un lÃ­mite predeterminado en el nÃºmero de acciones: las nuevas acciones se pueden generar continuamente como ingresos por negociaciÃ³n. Para simplificar, todos los anÃ¡lisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario;Generalizar a mÃºltiples resultados discretos debe ser sencillo. Denota los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y EX5 consulte http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismasket.html para obtener mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios.6 http://www.policyanalysismasket.com/ Haustive. Denota el precio instantÃ¡neo por acciÃ³n de A AS P1 y el precio por acciÃ³n de B como P2. Denota los pagos por acciÃ³n como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro nÃºmeros, P1, P2, P1, P2 son los nÃºmeros clave que los operadores deben rastrear y comprender. Tenga en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta;La recompensa por acciÃ³n se finaliza solo despuÃ©s de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un comerciante puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A AT Price P1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que los cambios de precio continuamente a medida que se compran las acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una funciÃ³n de precio de 0 a n.El uso de funciones e integrales continuas se puede ocultar a los comerciantes agregando los fabricantes de mercado automatizados que venden Ã³rdenes en lotes discretos de, por ejemplo, 100 acciones cada una. Estas Ã³rdenes de solicitud pueden ser ingresadas automÃ¡ticamente en el sistema por la instituciÃ³n del mercado, de modo que los comerciantes interactÃºan con lo que parece un CDA mÃ¡s familiar;Examinamos esta cuestiÃ³n de la interfaz con mÃ¡s detalle a continuaciÃ³n en la SecciÃ³n 4.2. Para nuestro anÃ¡lisis, presentamos la siguiente notaciÃ³n adicional. Denota M1 como la cantidad total de dinero que se apostaron en A, M2, ya que la cantidad total de dinero se apostaron en B, T = M1 + M2, ya que la cantidad total de dinero se apostaron en ambos lados, N1 como el nÃºmero total de acciones compradas de A,y n2 como el nÃºmero total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la funciÃ³n de precio. Varias funciones de precios naturales se describen a continuaciÃ³n;Cada uno estÃ¡ motivado como la soluciÃ³n Ãºnica para una restricciÃ³n particular en la dinÃ¡mica de precios.3.2 Ventajas y desventajas que yo sepa, un DPM es el Ãºnico mecanismo conocido para cubrir y especular que exhibe las tres propiedades siguientes: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) ningÃºn riesgo para la instituciÃ³n del mercado, y (3) incorporaciÃ³n continuade informaciÃ³n. Un pari-mut EstÃ¡ndar falla (3). Un CDA falla (1). Un CDAWMM, el mecanismo de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque tÃ©cnicamente un MSR expone a su patrÃ³n al riesgo (es decir, un pago futuro variable), la pÃ©rdida mÃ¡xima de los clientes estÃ¡ limitada, por lo que la distinciÃ³n entre un DPM y un MSR en tÃ©rminos de estas tres propiedades es mÃ¡s tÃ©cnica que prÃ¡ctica. Los comerciantes de DPM pueden cobrar el mercado temprano, al igual que los comerciantes del mercado de valores, para bloquear una ganancia o limitar una pÃ©rdida, una acciÃ³n que simplemente no es posible en un pari-Mutuel estÃ¡ndar. Un DPM tambiÃ©n tiene algunos inconvenientes. La recompensa para una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento de la operaciÃ³n como de la recompensa final por acciÃ³n en el cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes CDA, donde el vector de pago en los posibles resultados futuros se fija en el momento del comercio. Por lo tanto, un problema de optimizaciÃ³n estratÃ©gica de comerciantes se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia segÃºn una caminata aleatoria, los comerciantes pueden tomar la P actual como una estimaciÃ³n imparcial de la P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimizaciÃ³n. Si P no cambia de acuerdo con una caminata aleatoria, el mecanismo todavÃ­a tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulaciÃ³n, aunque la optimizaciÃ³n puede ser difÃ­cil, y determinar una medida de la opiniÃ³n agregada de los mercados de las probabilidades de A y B puede ser difÃ­cil. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de la caminata aleatoria mÃ¡s abajo en la SecciÃ³n 4.1 en la discusiÃ³n que rodea la AsunciÃ³n 3. Un segundo inconveniente de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral.173 Si bien un fabricante de mercado automatizado siempre estÃ¡ listo para aceptar las Ã³rdenes de compra, no hay un fabricante de mercado correspondiente para aceptar pedidos de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sÃ­ utilizando un mecanismo CDA estÃ¡ndar, por ejemplo, publicando un pedido de solicitud a un precio en o inferior al precio de venta actual. Los comerciantes tambiÃ©n siempre pueden vender de cobertura comprando acciones en el resultado opuesto del fabricante del mercado, cobrando asÃ­ su apuesta si no se liquidan por completo.3.3 Regla de redistribuciÃ³n En un mercado estÃ¡ndar de pari-mutuel, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada una apuesta ganadora de $ 1 recibe un reembolso de los $ 1 iniciales pagados, mÃ¡s una participaciÃ³n igual de todos los apuestas perdedoras, o (2) Cada apuesta ganadora de $ 1 recibe una participaciÃ³n igual de todas las apuestas, ganando o perdiendo. Debido a que cada dÃ³lar siempre gana una participaciÃ³n igual de la recompensa, las dos formulaciones son precisamente las mismas: $ 1 + mlose mwin = mwin + mlose mwin. En un mercado dinÃ¡mico de pari-mutuel, debido a que cada dÃ³lar no estÃ¡ igualmente ponderado, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones y mecanismos de precios significativamente diferentes, cada uno con diferentes propiedades potencialmente deseables. Consideramos cada caso a su vez. La siguiente secciÃ³n analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye la pÃ©rdida de dinero. La SecciÃ³n 5 examina el caso (2), donde se redistribuye todo el dinero.4. DPM I: Perder dinero redistribuido para el caso en el que se reembolsan los pagos iniciales sobre las apuestas ganadoras, y solo la pÃ©rdida de dinero se redistribuye, los pagos respectivos por acciÃ³n son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Entonces, si se produce A, los accionistas de A reciben todos sus pagos iniciales, mÃ¡s dÃ³lares de P1 por acciÃ³n, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero que se apostaron. Del mismo modo, si se produce B, los accionistas de B reciben todo su pago inicial, mÃ¡s dÃ³lares de P2 por acciÃ³n, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero que se apostaron. Sin pÃ©rdida de generalidad, analizarÃ© el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando los precios y los pagos solo por un solo. Las ecuaciones para B son simÃ©tricas. El valor esperado de los comerciantes por acciÃ³n para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de a es e [acciones] = pr (a) Â· e [p1 | a]-(1-pr (a)) Â· p1 e [acciones] = pr] = pr(A) Â· e Â»m2 n1 Ë› Ë› Ë› Ë› a - (1 - pr (a)) Â· p1 donde es una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de a, pr (a) es la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de a y p1es el precio instantÃ¡neo por acciÃ³n de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E [P1 | a] es la expectativa de los comerciantes de la recompensa por acciÃ³n de A despuÃ©s de que se cierre el mercado y dado que se produce A. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si se produce B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa, ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continÃºa la negociaciÃ³n. Entonces, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar lo que Ã©l o ella espera que la recompensa por acciÃ³n estÃ© al final (despuÃ©s de que se cierre el mercado) si se produce A. Si E [acciones]/> 0, un operador neutral en neutral de riesgo debe comprar acciones de A. Â¿CuÃ¡ntas acciones? Esto depende de la funciÃ³n de precio que determina P1. En general, P1 aumenta a medida que se compran mÃ¡s acciones. El operador neutral de riesgo debe continuar comprando acciones hasta E [acciones]/ = 0. (un operador de riesgo generalmente dejarÃ¡ de comprar acciones antes de conducir E [acciones]/ todo el camino a cero). Suponiendo que Riskneutrality, el problema de optimizaciÃ³n de los comerciantes es elegir una serie de acciones n â‰¥ 0 de A para comprar, para maximizar E [n acciones] = PR (a) Â· n Â· e [p1 | a] - (1 -PR(A)) Â· z n 0 p1 (n) dn.(1) Es fÃ¡cil ver que se puede resolver el mismo valor de N al encontrar el nÃºmero de acciones necesarias para impulsar E [acciones]/ a cero. Es decir, encuentre n â‰¥ 0 satisfacer 0 = pr (a) Â· e [p1 | a] - (1 - pr (a)) Â· p1 (n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 probabilidad de mercado comoLos comerciantes que creen que E [acciones de A]/> 0 compran acciones de A y comerciantes que creen que E [acciones de B]/> 0 compra acciones de B, los precios P1 y P2 cambian de acuerdo con una funciÃ³n de precio, segÃºn lo prescritoabajo. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opiniÃ³n de los mercados en su conjunto de las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera E [acciones]/ = 0, ya que los mecanismos son un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en agregado consideraron que E [acciones]/> 0, entonces habrÃ­a demanda neta de A, lo que aumenta el precio de A hasta que E [acciones]/ = 0. Definir MPR (a) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de una inferida al suponer que E [acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar que el MPR (a) es la probabilidad agregada de A tan juzgada por el mercado en su conjunto. MPR (a) es la soluciÃ³n a 0 = mPr (a) Â· e [p1 | a] - (1 - mpr (a)) Â· p1. ResoluciÃ³n obtenemos mpr (a) = p1 p1 + e [p1 | a].(2) En este punto hacemos una suposiciÃ³n crÃ­tica para simplificar enormemente el anÃ¡lisis;Suponemos que E [P1 | A] = P1.(3) Es decir, suponemos que el valor actual para la recompensa por acciÃ³n de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado de la recompensa por acciÃ³n de un dado que se produce. Esto es ciertamente cierto para la Ãºltima apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que se cierre el mercado. Sin embargo, no es obvio que la suposiciÃ³n sea cierto mucho antes de que se cierren los mercados. BÃ¡sicamente, asumimos que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con una caminata aleatoria imparcial: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjetivo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia del mercado bajo las cuales la suposiciÃ³n (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del comercio racional. Examinamos escenarios a continuaciÃ³n en los que 174 la suposiciÃ³n (3) parece especialmente plausible. No obstante, la suposiciÃ³n afecta solo a nuestro anÃ¡lisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada funciÃ³n de precio derivada a continuaciÃ³n implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los comerciantes pueden jugar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimizaciÃ³n (1) se simplifica enormemente;Sin embargo, la optimizaciÃ³n (1) no depende de la suposiciÃ³n, y los comerciantes aÃºn pueden optimizar proyectando estratÃ©gicamente el recompensa esperado final de cualquier forma complicada que deseen. Entonces, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulaciÃ³n no necesariamente depende de la verdad de la suposiciÃ³n (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fÃ¡cilmente un consenso de consenso de mercado agregado de los precios del mercado depende de (3).4.2 Funciones de precios Una variedad de funciones de precios parecen razonables, cada una exhibe varias propiedades e implica diferentes probabilidades de mercado.4.2.1 FunciÃ³n de precio I: Precio de A Equals Page de B Una funciÃ³n de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acciÃ³n de un igual al pago por acciÃ³n de B, y establecer el precio por acciÃ³n de B igual a la recompensapor acciÃ³n de A. Es decir, p1 = p2 p2 = p1.(4) Hacer cumplir esta relaciÃ³n reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan rastrear dos nÃºmeros en lugar de cuatro. La relaciÃ³n tiene sentido, ya que la nueva informaciÃ³n que respalda A deberÃ­a fomentar la compra de las acciones A, lo que aumenta tanto el precio de A como el recompensa de B, y la disminuciÃ³n del precio de B y el pago de A. En este entorno, la suposiciÃ³n (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipÃ³tesis de mercado eficiente lleva a los precios a seguir una caminata aleatoria, los pagos tambiÃ©n deben seguir una caminata aleatoria. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivaciÃ³n de la probabilidad de mercado: MPR (A) P1 = MPR (B) P1 MPR (A) P1 = MPR (B) P2 MPR (A) MPR (B) = P2 P1 MPR (A) mpr (b) = m1 n2 m2 n1 mpr (a) mpr (b) = m1n1 m2n2 mpr (a) = m1n1 m1n1 + m2n2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relaciÃ³n instantÃ¡nea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos derivar cÃ³mo cambian los precios cuando se compran las acciones (no infinitasimales). Sea n el nÃºmero de acciones compradas y sea la cantidad de dinero gastado comprando n acciones. Tenga en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantÃ¡neo por acciÃ³n y m = r n 0 p1 (n) dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuaciÃ³n (4), obtenemos: p1 = p2 dm dn = m1 + m n2 dm m1 + m = dn n2 z dm m1 + m = z dn n2 ln (m1 + m) = n n2 + c m = m1H E N N2 - 1 I (6) La ecuaciÃ³n 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantÃ¡neo por acciÃ³n en funciÃ³n de n es p1 (n) = dm dn = m1 n2 e n n2.(7) Tenga en cuenta que P1 (0) = M1/N2 = P2 segÃºn sea necesario. La derivaciÃ³n de la funciÃ³n de precio P2 (N) para B es anÃ¡loga y los resultados son simÃ©tricos. La nociÃ³n de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos en una funciÃ³n continua, probablemente sea extranjera para la mayorÃ­a de los comerciantes. Se puede implementar una interfaz mÃ¡s estÃ¡ndar discretizando los costos en muchas acciones, por ejemplo, muchas 100 acciones. Luego, la instituciÃ³n de mercado puede realizar pedidos de 100 acciones al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la instituciÃ³n de mercado puede realizar una orden de solicitaciÃ³n de 100 acciones al precio M (100)/100, otro pedido solicitado de 100 acciones al precio (M (200) -m (100))/100, un tercio solicita 100Acciones a (M (300) - M (200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado parece mÃ¡s familiar para los comerciantes, como un CDA tÃ­pico con una serie de pedidos de solicitud a varios precios disponibles automÃ¡ticamente. Un comerciante que compra menos de 100 acciones pagarÃ­a un poco mÃ¡s que si el costo verdadero se calculara usando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente serÃ­a mÃ¡s intuitiva y transparente para la mayorÃ­a de los comerciantes. Las ecuaciones anteriores suponen que todo el dinero que entra finalmente se devuelve o se redistribuye. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la instituciÃ³n del mercado no toma porciÃ³n del dinero. Esto podrÃ­a generalizarse para que la instituciÃ³n del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacciÃ³n, o un cierto porcentaje por transacciÃ³n, antes del dinero en el retorno o redistribuido. Finalmente, tenga en cuenta que la funciÃ³n de precio anterior no estÃ¡ definida cuando la cantidad apuesta o el nÃºmero de acciones son cero. Por lo tanto, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados, y un nÃºmero positivo de acciones en circulaciÃ³n en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeÃ±as en principio, pero el tamaÃ±o del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. AdemÃ¡s, cuanto mÃ¡s menores son las cantidades iniciales, mÃ¡s cada dÃ³lar nuevo afecta los precios. Los montos de inicializaciÃ³n podrÃ­an financiarse como un subsidio de la instituciÃ³n del mercado o un patrÃ³n, que llamarÃ¡ a una apuesta de semillas, o desde una parte de las tarifas cobradas, que llamarÃ¡ a una apuesta ante.4.2.2 FunciÃ³n de precio II: Precio de una proporcional al dinero en una funciÃ³n de un segundo precio puede derivarse al requerir que la relaciÃ³n de precios sea igual a la relaciÃ³n de dinero apasionado.175 es decir, p1 p2 = m1 m2.(8) En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero que se apodera en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece una forma particularmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que cuanto mÃ¡s dinero se mueve por un lado, mÃ¡s barato se convierte en una acciÃ³n en el otro lado, exactamente en la misma proporciÃ³n. Usando la ecuaciÃ³n 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implÃ­cita: m1 m2 = p1 p2 = mpr (a) mpr (b) Â· m2 n1 mpr (b) mpr (a) Â· m1 n2= (Mpr (a)) 2 (mpr (b)) 2 Â· m2n2 m1n1 (mpr (a)) 2 (mpr (b)) 2 = (m1) 2 n1 (m2) 2n2 mpr (a) mpr (b)= M1 âˆš n1 m2 âˆš n2 mpr (a) = m1 âˆš n1 m1 âˆš n1 + m2 âˆš n2 (9) Podemos resolver el precio instantÃ¡neo de la siguiente manera: p1 = mpr (a) mpr (b) Â· p1 = m1 âˆšN1 m2 âˆš n2 Â· m2 n1 = m1 âˆš n1n2 (10) Funcionando desde el precio instantÃ¡neo anterior, podemos derivar la funciÃ³n de costo implÃ­cita en la funciÃ³n del nÃºmero N de las acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: DM DM = M1 + M âˆš+ n âˆš n2 z dm m1 + m = z dn âˆš n1 + n âˆš n2 ln (m1 + m) = 2 n2 [(n1 + n) n2] 1 2 + c m = m1 e 2 r n1 + n n2 âˆ’2 R N1 N2 - 1 #.(11) A partir de esto obtenemos la funciÃ³n de precio: p1 (n) = dm dn = m1 p (n1 + n) n2 e 2 r n1 + n n2 âˆ’2 r n1 n2.(12) Tenga en cuenta que, segÃºn sea necesario, p1 (0) = m1/âˆš n1n2, y p1 (0)/p2 (0) = m1/m2. Si uno usa la funciÃ³n de precios anterior, entonces la dinÃ¡mica del mercado serÃ¡ tal que la relaciÃ³n de los precios (instantÃ¡neos) de A y B siempre es igual a la relaciÃ³n de las cantidades que se apoderan de A y B, lo que parece bastante natural. Tenga en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo puede modificarse para recaudar tarifas de transacciÃ³n de algÃºn tipo. TambiÃ©n tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semillas o ante para inicializar el sistema.5. DPM II: Todo el dinero redistribuido anteriormente examinamos la polÃ­tica de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo apuestas perdedoras. En esta secciÃ³n consideramos la segunda polÃ­tica mencionada en la SecciÃ³n 3.3: Todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuyen a apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que se redistribuye todo el dinero, los pagos respectivos por acciÃ³n son: p1 = m1 + m2 n1 = t n1 p2 = m1 + m2 n2 = t n2, donde t = m1 + m2 es la cantidad total de dinero apasionado en amboslados. Entonces, si se produce A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben dÃ³lares de P1 por acciÃ³n propiedad;Los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero que se apostaron. Del mismo modo, si se produce B, los accionistas de B pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dÃ³lares por acciÃ³n propiedad;Los accionistas de una pÃ©rdida de todo el dinero se apostaron. En este caso, el valor esperado de los comerciantes por acciÃ³n para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E [acciones] = PR (A) Â· E [P1 | A]-P1.(13) Un operador neutral de riesgo optimiza al elegir una serie de acciones n â‰¥ 0 de A para comprar, para maximizar E [n acciones] = PR (a) Â· n Â· e [p1 | a]-z n 0p1 (n) dn = pr (a) Â· n Â· e [p1 | a] - m (14) Se puede resolver el mismo valor de n al encontrar el nÃºmero de acciones necesarias para impulsar E [acciones]/ a cero. Es decir, encuentre n â‰¥ 0 satisfaciendo 0 = pr (a) Â· e [p1 | a] - p1 (n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 probabilidad de mercado en este caso mpr (a), el agregadoLa probabilidad de A segÃºn el mercado en su conjunto, es la soluciÃ³n a 0 = MPR (a) Â· E [P1 | A] - P1. ResoluciÃ³n obtenemos mpr (a) = p1 e [p1 | a].(15) Como antes, hacemos la suposiciÃ³n simplificadora (3) de que la recompensa final esperada por acciÃ³n es igual a la recompensa actual por acciÃ³n. La suposiciÃ³n es crÃ­tica para nuestro anÃ¡lisis, pero es posible que no sea necesario para una implementaciÃ³n prÃ¡ctica.5.2 Funciones de precio para el caso en el que se distribuye todo el dinero, las limitaciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivaciÃ³n de una funciÃ³n de precio coherente. Se puede derivar una funciÃ³n de precio razonable de la restricciÃ³n (8) empleada en la SecciÃ³n 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la relaciÃ³n de precios sea igual a la relaciÃ³n de dinero que se apostaron. Es decir, p1/p2 = m1/m2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero que se mueve en A, y de manera similar para B. 176 usando las ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15 podemos obtener la probabilidad de mercado implÃ­cita: M1 M2 = P1 P2 = MPR (A) MPr (b) Â· t n1 Â· n2 t = mpr (a) mpr (b) Â· n2 n1 mpr (a) mpr (b) = m1n1 m2n2 mpr (a) = m1n1 m1n1 + m2n2 (16) interesante, esto esLa misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la SecciÃ³n 4.2.1 para el caso de perder la redistribuciÃ³n de dinero con las limitaciones de que el precio es igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantÃ¡neo por acciÃ³n para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (m1) 2 + m1m2 m1n1 + m2n2 = m1 + m2 n1 + m2 m1 n2 trabajando desde el precio instantÃ¡neo anterior, podemos derivar el nÃºmero de acciones que pueden poder puedenser comprado para M dÃ³lares, de la siguiente manera: DM DN = M1 + M2 + M N1 + N + M2 M1 + M N2 DN DM = N1 + N + M2 M1 + M N2 M1 + M2 + M (17) Â· Â· Â· N= m (n1 - n2) t + n2 (t + m) m2 ln Â»t (m1 + m) m1 (t + m). Tenga en cuenta que resolvimos para n (m) en lugar de m (n). No pude encontrar una soluciÃ³n de forma cerrada para M (N), como se derivÃ³ para los otros dos casos anteriores. AÃºn asÃ­, N (M) se puede usar para determinar cuÃ¡ntas acciones se pueden comprar por dÃ³lares M, y la funciÃ³n inversa puede aproximarse a cualquier grado numÃ©ricamente. De n (m) tambiÃ©n podemos calcular la funciÃ³n de precio: p1 (m) = dm dn = (m1 + m) m2t denom, (18) donde denom = (m1 + m) m2n1 + (m2 - m) m2n2 + t(M1 + m) n2 ln Â»t (m1 + m) m1 (t + m) Tenga en cuenta que, segÃºn sea necesario, p1 (0)/p2 (0) = m1/m2. Si uno usa la funciÃ³n de precio anterior, entonces la dinÃ¡mica del mercado serÃ¡ tal que la relaciÃ³n de los precios (instantÃ¡neos) de A y B siempre es igual a la relaciÃ³n de las cantidades que se apoderan de A y B. Esta funciÃ³n de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actÃºa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $ 1 en A y simultÃ¡neamente apostar $ 1 en B es igual a cero, suponiendo (3). Es decir, E [$ 1 de A + $ 1 de B] = 0. Se omite la derivaciÃ³n.5.3 ComparaciÃ³n de DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta sobre el resultado ganador estÃ¡ garantizado al menos que alcanzarÃ¡ el punto de equilibrio. La principal desventaja de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras es que las acciones no son homogÃ©neas: cada parte de A, por ejemplo, en realidad estÃ¡ compuesta por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso o un boleto de loterÃ­a que paga $ P si se produce, donde P, donde Pes el precio pagado por acciÃ³n, y (2) una acciÃ³n de la recompensa final ($ P1) si se produce A. Esto complica la implementaciÃ³n de un mercado de accesorios para cobrar el mercado temprano, lo que examinaremos a continuaciÃ³n en la SecciÃ³n 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogÃ©neas: cada acciÃ³n da derecho a su propietario a una porciÃ³n igual de la recompensa final. Debido a que las acciones son homogÃ©neas, la implementaciÃ³n de un posventa es sencilla, como veremos en la SecciÃ³n 7. Por otro lado, debido a que los precios iniciales pagados no son reembolsados por las apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios se balancean lo suficientemente enormemente, una apuesta en el resultado correcto en realidad podrÃ­a perder dinero. Los operadores deben ser conscientes de que si compran un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae, lo que permite que muchos otros ingresen a un precio mucho mÃ¡s bajo, pueden perder dinero al final independientemente del resultado. De los experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea comÃºn, pero sin embargo requiere atenciÃ³n al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una soluciÃ³n potencial serÃ­a que el fabricante del mercado realice un seguimiento de cuÃ¡ndo el precio estÃ¡ demasiado bajo, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el fabricante de mercado podrÃ­a dejar de bajar artificialmente el precio. Los pedidos de venta en el mercado de accesorios aÃºn pueden llegar por debajo del precio del mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podrÃ­a garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se rompa.6. Otras variaciones Una funciÃ³n de precio ascendente simple establecerÃ­a p1 = Î±M1 y p2 = Î±M2, donde Î±> 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirÃ­an. Para el caso de que se redistribuya todo el dinero, esto eliminarÃ­a la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta en el resultado correcto. A pesar de que el precio de los fabricantes de mercado solo aumenta, el precio actual puede caer muy por debajo del precio del mercado, ya que los pedidos solicitados se realizan en el mercado de accesorios. He derivado funciones de precios para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodologÃ­a anterior. Cada funciÃ³n de precio puede tener sus propias propiedades deseables, pero no estÃ¡ claro cuÃ¡l es el mejor, o incluso que existe un mejor mÃ©todo. AnÃ¡lisis adicionales y, lo que es mÃ¡s importante, se requieren investigaciones empÃ­ricas para responder estas preguntas.7. Los poskarkets Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado estÃ¡ndar de pari-mutuel es la capacidad de cobrar el mercado antes de que se cierre, para obtener ganancias o limitar una pÃ©rdida. Esto se logra al permitir que los comerciantes coloquen pedidos en la misma cola que el fabricante de mercado. Por lo tanto, los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron a los precios establecidos por el fabricante del mercado. O los comerciantes pueden realizar un pedido de venta lÃ­mite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarÃ¡n cualquier acciÃ³n existente a la venta a los precios mÃ¡s bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al fabricante del mercado.7.1 Pasal de posventa para DPM II para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde se redistribuye todo el dinero 177, permitiendo que un mercado de accesorios sea simple. De hecho, el mercado de accesorios puede ser un descriptor deficiente: comprar y vender estÃ¡n completamente integrados en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acciÃ³n vale precisamente la misma cantidad, por lo que los comerciantes pueden simplemente hacer pedidos de solicitaciÃ³n en la misma cola que el fabricante de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarÃ¡n el precio de venta mÃ¡s bajo, ya sea que provenga del fabricante del mercado u otro comerciante. De esta manera, los comerciantes pueden cobrar temprano y alejarse con sus ganancias o pÃ©rdidas actuales, suponiendo que puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto.7.2 El mercado de accesorios para DPM I cuando se reembolsan las apuestas ganadoras y solo se redistribuyen las apuestas perdedoras, cada acciÃ³n vale la pena una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuÃ¡nto se pagÃ³ por ello, por lo que no es un asunto tan simple establecer un mercado de accesorios. Sin embargo, todavÃ­a es posible un mercado de accesorios. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los comerciantes, por lo que parece tan simple como realizar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogÃ©neas: cada parte de A en realidad estÃ¡ compuesta por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de dÃ³lares P Â· 1A, y (2) el pago de dÃ³lares P1 Â· 1A, donde P es la acciÃ³n por acciÃ³nEl precio pagado y 1A es la funciÃ³n indicadora que iguala 1 si se produce A, y 0 de lo contrario. Uno puede imaginar ejecutar dos accesorios de accesorios separados donde las personas pueden vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercado de accesorios, agrupÃ¡ndolos automÃ¡ticamente en la relaciÃ³n correcta y vendiÃ©ndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los comerciantes pueden cobrar retrasando los pedidos de venta en la misma cola que el fabricante de mercado de DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explÃ­citamente dos accesorios de accesorios separados. El mecanismo de agrupaciÃ³n funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual por 1 acciÃ³n de A es P1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acciÃ³n en P1. El comprador paga dÃ³lares P1 y recibe P1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dÃ³lares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercado de accesorios, la participaciÃ³n de los compradores se construye agrupando P1 Â· 1a desde el primer mercado de accesorios, y P1 Â· 1a desde el segundo mercado de accesorios. El vendedor en el primer mercado de accesorios recibe P1MPR (a) dÃ³lares, y el vendedor en el segundo posventa recibe dÃ³lares P1MPR (b).7.3 Pseudo posventa para DPM I Hay un pseudo posventa alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I que no requiere agrupaciÃ³n. Considere una parte de una comprada por $ 5. La acciÃ³n estÃ¡ compuesta por $ 5 Â· 1a y $ P1 Â· 1A. Ahora suponga que el precio actual ha pasado de $ 5 a $ 10 por acciÃ³n y el comerciante quiere cobrar con ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acciones al precio de mercado (1/2 acciÃ³n por $ 5), recibiendo todas las inversiones iniciales de $ 5 y retener 1/2 acciÃ³n de A. La acciÃ³n de 1/2 vale una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el recompensa final. Por lo tanto, el comerciante queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversiÃ³n inicial. El comerciante esencialmente ha cobrado y encerrado en sus ganancias. Ahora suponga que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $ 5 a $ 2 por acciÃ³n. El comerciante decide limitar su pÃ©rdida vendiendo la acciÃ³n por $ 2. El comprador obtiene la 1 acciÃ³n mÃ¡s $ 2 Â· 1a (el precio reembolsado de los compradores). El comerciante (vendedor) obtiene los $ 2 mÃ¡s lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $ 3 Â· 1A. La pÃ©rdida de comerciantes ahora se limita a $ 3 como mÃ¡ximo en lugar de $ 5. Si se produce A, el comerciante llega uniforme;Si se produce B, el comerciante pierde $ 3. TambiÃ©n tenga en cuenta que, en los comerciantes de formulaciÃ³n DPM, siempre pueden cobrar la venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin la necesidad de ningÃºn tipo de accesorio para el mercado de accesorios.8. Conclusiones que he presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrir, un futuro evento incierto, llamado un mercado dinÃ¡mico pari-mutuel (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgos de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinÃ¡mica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n continua. Que yo sepa, todos los mecanismos existentes que incluyen el mercado estÃ¡ndar de pari-mutuel, el CDA, el CDAWMM, el mecanismo de apuestas y el MSR-Exhibit como mÃ¡ximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es el mÃ¡s cercano a un DPM en tÃ©rminos de estas propiedades, si no en tÃ©rminos de mecÃ¡nica. Dadas algunas limitaciones naturales en la dinÃ¡mica de precios, he obtenido en forma cerrada las funciones de precios implÃ­citas, que codifican cÃ³mo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran las acciones. La interfaz para los comerciantes se parece mucho al CDA familiar, con el sistema actuando como un fabricante de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un nÃºmero infinito de pedidos de compra a algÃºn precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una en la que solo la pÃ©rdida de dinero se redistribuye, y una donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propios pros y contras, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado de accesorios, para que los comerciantes puedan cobrar el mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para bloquear sus ganancias o limitar sus pÃ©rdidas, una operaciÃ³n que no es posible en un entorno de pari-mutuel estÃ¡ndar.9. Future Trabajo Este documento informa los resultados de una investigaciÃ³n inicial del concepto de un mercado dinÃ¡mico de pari-mutuel. Muchas vÃ­as para el trabajo futuro se presentan en sÃ­ mismos, incluidos los siguientes: â€¢ Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. El signo de interrogaciÃ³n mÃ¡s importante en mi mente es si la suposiciÃ³n de caminata aleatoria (3) puede demostrarse en condiciones razonables de eficiencia del mercado y, si no, cuÃ¡n severamente afecta la practicidad del sistema.â€¢ AnÃ¡lisis de incentivos. Formalmente, Â¿cuÃ¡les son los incentivos para que los operadores actÃºen sobre nueva informaciÃ³n y cuÃ¡ndo? Â¿CÃ³mo es el nivel de los incentivos de comerciante inicial de los comerciantes?â€¢ Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se concentrÃ³ en las matemÃ¡ticas y las algoritmics del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad de los mecanismos para servir como instrumento para cobertura, apuesta o agregaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n es probarlo con comerciantes reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, Â¿cÃ³mo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo DPM?â€¢ Mercado de llamadas DPM. He derivado las funciones de precios para reaccionar a las apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podrÃ­a generalizarse para aceptar Ã³rdenes en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios por completo, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas.â€¢ Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden generalizarse fÃ¡cilmente a mÃºltiples resultados discretos 178, y mÃºltiples resultados de valor real que siempre suman algÃºn valor constante (por ejemplo, mÃºltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar a 100). Sin embargo, la generalizaciÃ³n a las variables de valor real con el rango arbitrario es menos clara y abierta para el desarrollo futuro.â€¢ Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorios [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuaciÃ³n del mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM tambiÃ©n puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto queda por ver. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson.10.

        "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
        "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
        "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
        "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
        "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
        "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
        "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
        "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
        "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
        "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
        "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
        "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
        "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
        "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
        "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
        "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
        "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
        "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
        "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
        "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
        "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
        "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
        "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
        "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
        "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
        "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
        "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
        "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
        "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
        "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
        "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
        "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
        "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
        "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
        "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
        "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
        "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
        "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
        "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
        "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
        "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
        "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
        "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
        "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
        "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
        "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
        "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
        "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
        "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
        "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
        "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
        "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
        "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
        "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
        "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
        "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
        "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
        "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
        "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
        "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
        "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
        "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
        "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
        "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
        "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
        "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
        "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
        "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
        "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
        "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
        "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
        "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
        "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
        "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
        "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
        "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
        "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
        "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
        "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
        "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
        "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
        "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
        "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
        "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
        "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
        "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
        "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
        "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
        "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
        "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
        "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
        "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
        "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
        "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
        "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
        "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
        "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
        "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
        "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
        "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
        "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
        "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
        "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
        "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
        "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
        "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
        "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
        "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
        "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
        "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
        "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
        "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
        "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
        "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
        "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
        "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
        "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
        "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
        "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
        "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
        "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
        "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
        "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",
        "Denote the two outcomes A and B.",
        "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive.",
        "Denote the instantaneous price per share of A as p1 and the price per share of B as p2.",
        "Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively.",
        "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
        "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",
        "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
        "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
        "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",
        "For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation.",
        "Denote M1 as the total amount of money wagered on A, M2 as the total amount of money wagered on B, T = M1 + M2 as the total amount of money wagered on both sides, N1 as the total number of shares purchased of A, and N2 as the total number of shares purchased of B.",
        "There are many ways to formulate the price function.",
        "Several natural price functions are outlined below; each is motivated as the unique solution to a particular constraint on price dynamics. 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages To my knowledge, a DPM is the only known mechanism for hedging and speculating that exhibits all three of the following properties: (1) guaranteed liquidity, (2) no risk for the market institution, and (3) continuous incorporation of information.",
        "A standard pari-mutuel fails (3).",
        "A CDA fails (1).",
        "A CDAwMM, the bookmaker mechanism, and an MSR all fail (2).",
        "Even though technically an MSR exposes its patron to risk (i.e., a variable future payoff), the patrons maximum loss is bounded, so the distinction between a DPM and an MSR in terms of these three properties is more technical than practical.",
        "DPM traders can cash out of the market early, just like stock market traders, to lock in a profit or limit a loss, an action that is simply not possible in a standard pari-mutuel.",
        "A DPM also has some drawbacks.",
        "The payoff for a wager depends both on the price at the time of the trade, and on the final payoff per share at the markets close.",
        "This contrasts with the CDA variants, where the payoff vector across possible future outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade.",
        "So a traders strategic optimization problem is complicated by the need to predict the final values of P1 and P2.",
        "If P changes according to a random walk, then traders can take the current P as an unbiased estimate of the final P, greatly decreasing the complexity of their optimization.",
        "If P does not change according to a random walk, the mechanism still has utility as a mechanism for hedging and speculating, though optimization may be difficult, and determining a measure of the markets aggregate opinion of the probabilities of A and B may be difficult.",
        "We discuss the implications of random walk behavior further below in Section 4.1 in the discussion surrounding Assumption 3.",
        "A second drawback of a DPM is its one-sided nature. 173 While an automated market maker always stands ready to accept buy orders, there is no corresponding market maker to accept sell orders.",
        "Traders must sell to each other using a standard CDA mechanism, for example by posting an ask order at a price at or below the market makers current ask price.",
        "Traders can also always hedge-sell by purchasing shares in the opposite outcome from the market maker, thereby hedging their bet if not fully liquidating it. 3.3 Redistribution rule In a standard pari-mutuel market, payoffs can be computed in either of two equivalent ways: (1) each winning $1 wager receives a refund of the initial $1 paid, plus an equal share of all losing wagers, or (2) each winning $1 wager receives an equal share of all wagers, winning or losing.",
        "Because each dollar always earns an equal share of the payoff, the two formulations are precisely the same: $1 + Mlose Mwin = Mwin + Mlose Mwin .",
        "In a dynamic pari-mutuel market, because each dollar is not equally weighted, the two formulations are distinct, and lead to significantly different price functions and mechanisms, each with different potentially desirable properties.",
        "We consider each case in turn.",
        "The next section analyzes case (1), where only losing money is redistributed.",
        "Section 5 examines case (2), where all money is redistributed. 4.",
        "DPM I: LOSING MONEY REDISTRIBUTED For the case where the initial payments on winning bets are refunded, and only losing money is redistributed, the respective payoffs per share are simply: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2 .",
        "So, if A occurs, shareholders of A receive all of their initial payment back, plus P1 dollars per share owned, while shareholders of B lose all money wagered.",
        "Similarly, if B occurs, shareholders of B receive all of their initial payment back, plus P2 dollars per share owned, while shareholders of A lose all money wagered.",
        "Without loss of generality, I will analyze the market from the perspective of A, deriving prices and payoffs for A only.",
        "The equations for B are symmetric.",
        "The traders per-share expected value for purchasing an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A is E[ shares] = Pr(A) Â· E [P1|A] âˆ’ (1 âˆ’ Pr(A)) Â· p1 E[ shares] = Pr(A) Â· E Â» M2 N1 Ë› Ë› Ë› Ë› A âˆ’ (1 âˆ’ Pr(A)) Â· p1 where is an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A, Pr(A) is the traders belief in the probability of A, and p1 is the instantaneous price per share of A for an infinitesimal quantity of shares.",
        "E[P1|A] is the traders expectation of the payoff per share of A after the market closes and given that A occurs.",
        "This is a subtle point.",
        "The value of P1 does not matter if B occurs, since in this case shares of A are worthless, and the current value of P1 does not necessarily matter as this may change as trading continues.",
        "So, in order to determine the expected value of shares of A, the trader must estimate what he or she expects the payoff per share to be in the end (after the market closes) if A occurs.",
        "If E[ shares]/ > 0, a risk-neutral trader should purchase shares of A.",
        "How many shares?",
        "This depends on the price function determining p1.",
        "In general, p1 increases as more shares are purchased.",
        "The risk-neutral trader should continue purchasing shares until E[ shares]/ = 0. (A riskaverse trader will generally stop purchasing shares before driving E[ shares]/ all the way to zero.)",
        "Assuming riskneutrality, the traders optimization problem is to choose a number of shares n â‰¥ 0 of A to purchase, in order to maximize E[n shares] = Pr(A)Â·nÂ·E [P1|A]âˆ’(1âˆ’Pr(A))Â· Z n 0 p1(n)dn. (1) Its easy to see that the same value of n can be solved for by finding the number of shares required to drive E[ shares]/ to zero.",
        "That is, find n â‰¥ 0 satisfying 0 = Pr(A) Â· E [P1|A] âˆ’ (1 âˆ’ Pr(A)) Â· p1(n), if such a n exists, otherwise n = 0. 4.1 Market probability As traders who believe that E[ shares of A]/ > 0 purchase shares of A and traders who believe that E[ shares of B]/ > 0 purchase shares of B, the prices p1 and p2 change according to a price function, as prescribed below.",
        "The current prices in a sense reflect the markets opinion as a whole of the relative probabilities of A and B.",
        "Assuming an efficient marketplace, the market as a whole considers E[ shares]/ = 0, since the mechanisms is a zero sum game.",
        "For example, if market participants in aggregate felt that E[ shares]/ > 0, then there would be net demand for A, driving up the price of A until E[ shares]/ = 0.",
        "Define MPr(A) to be the market probability of A, or the probability of A inferred by assuming that E[ shares]/ = 0.",
        "We can consider MPr(A) to be the aggregate probability of A as judged by the market as a whole.",
        "MPr(A) is the solution to 0 = MPr(A) Â· E[P1|A] âˆ’ (1 âˆ’ MPr(A)) Â· p1.",
        "Solving we get MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) At this point we make a critical assumption in order to greatly simplify the analysis; we assume that E[P1|A] = P1. (3) That is, we assume that the current value for the payoff per share of A is the same as the expected final value of the payoff per share of A given that A occurs.",
        "This is certainly true for the last (infinitesimal) wager before the market closes.",
        "Its not obvious, however, that the assumption is true well before the markets close.",
        "Basically, we are assuming that the value of P1 moves according to an unbiased random walk: the current value of P1 is the best expectation of its future value.",
        "I conjecture that there are reasonable market efficiency conditions under which assumption (3) is true, though I have not been able to prove that it arises naturally from rational trading.",
        "We examine scenarios below in which 174 assumption (3) seems especially plausible.",
        "Nonetheless, the assumption effects our analysis only.",
        "Regardless of whether (3) is true, each price function derived below implies a welldefined zero-sum game in which traders can play.",
        "If traders can assume that (3) is true, then their optimization problem (1) is greatly simplified; however, optimizing (1) does not depend on the assumption, and traders can still optimize by strategically projecting the final expected payoff in whatever complicated way they desire.",
        "So, the utility of DPM for hedging and speculating does not necessarily hinge on the truth of assumption (3).",
        "On the other hand, the ability to easily infer an aggregate market consensus probability from market prices does depend on (3). 4.2 Price functions A variety of price functions seem reasonable, each exhibiting various properties, and implying differing market probabilities. 4.2.1 Price function I: Price of A equals payoff of B One natural price function to consider is to set the price per share of A equal to the payoff per share of B, and set the price per share of B equal to the payoff per share of A.",
        "That is, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Enforcing this relationship reduces the dimensionality of the system from four to two, simplifying the interface: traders need only track two numbers instead of four.",
        "The relationship makes sense, since new information supporting A should encourage purchasing of shares A, driving up both the price of A and the payoff of B, and driving down the price of B and the payoff of A.",
        "In this setting, assumption (3) seems especially reasonable, since if an efficient market hypothesis leads prices to follow a random walk, than payoffs must also follow a random walk.",
        "The constraints (4) lead to the following derivation of the market probability: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) The constraints (4) specify the instantaneous relationship between payoff and price.",
        "From this, we can derive how prices change when (non-infinitesimal) shares are purchased.",
        "Let n be the number of shares purchased and let m be the amount of money spent purchasing n shares.",
        "Note that p1 = dm/dn, the instantaneous price per share, and m = R n 0 p1(n)dn.",
        "Substituting into equation (4), we get: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 âˆ’ 1 i (6) Equation 6 gives the cost of purchasing n shares.",
        "The instantaneous price per share as a function of n is p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2 . (7) Note that p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 as required.",
        "The derivation of the price function p2(n) for B is analogous and the results are symmetric.",
        "The notion of buying infinitesimal shares, or integrating costs over a continuous function, are probably foreign to most traders.",
        "A more standard interface can be implemented by discretizing the costs into round lots of shares, for example lots of 100 shares.",
        "Then ask orders of 100 shares each at the appropriate price can be automatically placed by the market institution.",
        "For example, the market institution can place an ask order for 100 shares at price m(100)/100, another ask order for 100 shares at price (m(200)âˆ’m(100))/100, a third ask for 100 shares at (m(300)âˆ’ m(200))/100, etc.",
        "In this way, the market looks more familiar to traders, like a typical CDA with a number of ask orders at various prices automatically available.",
        "A trader buying less than 100 shares would pay a bit more than if the true cost were computed using (6), but the discretized interface would probably be more intuitive and transparent to the majority of traders.",
        "The above equations assume that all money that comes in is eventually returned or redistributed.",
        "In other words, the mechanism is a zero sum game, and the market institution takes no portion of the money.",
        "This could be generalized so that the market institution always takes a certain amount, or a certain percent, or a certain amount per transaction, or a certain percent per transaction, before money in returned or redistributed.",
        "Finally, note that the above price function is undefined when the amount bet or the number of shares are zero.",
        "So the system must begin with some positive amount on both sides, and some positive number of shares outstanding on both sides.",
        "These initial amounts can be arbitrarily small in principle, but the size of the initial subsidy may affect the incentives of traders to participate.",
        "Also, the smaller the initial amounts, the more each new dollar effects the prices.",
        "The initialization amounts could be funded as a subsidy from the market institution or a patron, which Ill call a seed wager, or from a portion of the fees charged, which Ill call an ante wager. 4.2.2 Price function II: Price of A proportional to money on A A second price function can be derived by requiring the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered. 175 That is, p1 p2 = M1 M2 . (8) In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B.",
        "This seems like a particularly natural way to set the price, since the more money that is wagered on one side, the cheaper becomes a share on the other side, in exactly the same proportion.",
        "Using Equation 8, along with (2) and (3), we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) Â· M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) Â· M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 Â· M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 âˆš N1 M2 âˆš N2 MPr(A) = M1 âˆš N1 M1 âˆš N1 + M2 âˆš N2 (9) We can solve for the instantaneous price as follows: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) Â· P1 = M1 âˆš N1 M2 âˆš N2 Â· M2 N1 = M1 âˆš N1N2 (10) Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the implied cost function m as a function of the number n of shares purchased as follows: dm dn = M1 + m âˆš N1 + n âˆš N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn âˆš N1 + n âˆš N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 âˆ’2 r N1 N2 âˆ’ 1 # . (11) From this we get the price function: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 âˆ’2 r N1 N2 . (12) Note that, as required, p1(0) = M1/ âˆš N1N2, and p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
        "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B, which seems fairly natural.",
        "Note that, as before, the mechanism can be modified to collect transaction fees of some kind.",
        "Also note that seed or ante wagers are required to initialize the system. 5.",
        "DPM II: ALL MONEY REDISTRIBUTED Above we examined the policy of refunding winning wagers and redistributing only losing wagers.",
        "In this section we consider the second policy mentioned in Section 3.3: all money from all wagers are collected and redistributed to winning wagers.",
        "For the case where all money is redistributed, the respective payoffs per share are: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2 , where T = M1 + M2 is the total amount of money wagered on both sides.",
        "So, if A occurs, shareholders of A lose their initial price paid, but receive P1 dollars per share owned; shareholders of B simply lose all money wagered.",
        "Similarly, if B occurs, shareholders of B lose their initial price paid, but receive P2 dollars per share owned; shareholders of A lose all money wagered.",
        "In this case, the traders per-share expected value for purchasing an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A is E[ shares] = Pr(A) Â· E [P1|A] âˆ’ p1. (13) A risk-neutral trader optimizes by choosing a number of shares n â‰¥ 0 of A to purchase, in order to maximize E[n shares] = Pr(A) Â· n Â· E [P1|A] âˆ’ Z n 0 p1(n)dn = Pr(A) Â· n Â· E [P1|A] âˆ’ m (14) The same value of n can be solved for by finding the number of shares required to drive E[ shares]/ to zero.",
        "That is, find n â‰¥ 0 satisfying 0 = Pr(A) Â· E [P1|A] âˆ’ p1(n), if such a n exists, otherwise n = 0. 5.1 Market probability In this case MPr(A), the aggregate probability of A as judged by the market as a whole, is the solution to 0 = MPr(A) Â· E[P1|A] âˆ’ p1.",
        "Solving we get MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) As before, we make the simplifying assumption (3) that the expected final payoff per share equals the current payoff per share.",
        "The assumption is critical for our analysis, but may not be required for a practical implementation. 5.2 Price functions For the case where all money is distributed, the constraints (4) that keep the price of A equal to the payoff of B, and vice versa, do not lead to the derivation of a coherent price function.",
        "A reasonable price function can be derived from the constraint (8) employed in Section 4.2.2, where we require that the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered.",
        "That is, p1/p2 = M1/M2.",
        "In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B. 176 Using Equations 3, 8, and 15 we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) Â· T N1 Â· N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) Â· N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Interestingly, this is the same market probability derived in Section 4.2.1 for the case of losing-money redistribution with the constraints that the price of A equal the payoff of B and vice versa.",
        "The instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares is: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the number of shares n that can be purchased for m dollars, as follows: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) Â· Â· Â· n = m(N1 âˆ’ N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln Â» T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) .",

        "I could not find a closed-form solution for m(n), as was derived for the two other cases above.",
        "Still, n(m) can be used to determine how many shares can be purchased for m dollars, and the inverse function can be approximated to any degree numerically.",
        "From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 âˆ’ m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln Â» T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
        "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B.",
        "This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3).",
        "That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0.",
        "The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even.",
        "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
        "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
        "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
        "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
        "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
        "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
        "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
        "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
        "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
        "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
        "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = Î±M1 and p2 = Î±M2, where Î± > 0.",
        "In this case, prices would only go up.",
        "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
        "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
        "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
        "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
        "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
        "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
        "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
        "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
        "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
        "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
        "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
        "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
        "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
        "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
        "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
        "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
        "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
        "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
        "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
        "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
        "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
        "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
        "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
        "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dollars.",
        "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket.",
        "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
        "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
        "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
        "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
        "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
        "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
        "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
        "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
        "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
        "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
        "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
        "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 Â· 1A.",
        "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
        "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
        "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
        "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
        "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
        "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
        "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
        "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
        "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
        "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
        "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
        "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
        "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
        "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
        "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
        "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
        "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
        "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
        "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
        "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
        "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
        "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
        "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
        "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
        "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
        "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for <br>risk allocation</br> and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",
                "Denote the two outcomes A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive.",
                "Denote the instantaneous price per share of A as p1 and the price per share of B as p2.",
                "Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively.",
                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",
                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",

                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 Â· 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
                "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",

                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",

                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",

                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",

                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",

                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = Î±M1 and p2 = Î±M2, where Î± > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 Â· 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a <br>dynamic pari-mutuel market</br> (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a <br>dynamic pari-mutuel market</br>.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
                "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",

                "A <br>dpm</br> acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a <br>dpm</br> offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a <br>dpm</br> can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The <br>dpm</br> price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",

                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a <br>hybrid</br> between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",

                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",

                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",

                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",

                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",

                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",

                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a <br>pari-mutuel market</br> has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a <br>pari-mutuel market</br>, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a <br>pari-mutuel market</br>, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a <br>pari-mutuel market</br> is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a <br>pari-mutuel market</br> can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated <br>pari-mutuel market</br>, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual <br>pari-mutuel market</br>, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual <br>pari-mutuel market</br>.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC <br>pari-mutuel market</br> 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard <br>pari-mutuel market</br>, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",

                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
                "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",
                "For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation.",

                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 Â· 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic <br>pari-mutuel market</br> (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard <br>pari-mutuel market</br>, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic <br>pari-mutuel market</br>.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
                "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",

                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",

                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",

                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the <br>continuous double auction</br> (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",

                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",
                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
                "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",
                "For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation.",
                "Denote M1 as the total amount of money wagered on A, M2 as the total amount of money wagered on B, T = M1 + M2 as the total amount of money wagered on both sides, N1 as the total number of shares purchased of A, and N2 as the total number of shares purchased of B.",
                "There are many ways to formulate the price function.",
                "Several natural price functions are outlined below; each is motivated as the unique solution to a particular constraint on price dynamics. 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages To my knowledge, a DPM is the only known mechanism for hedging and speculating that exhibits all three of the following properties: (1) guaranteed liquidity, (2) no risk for the market institution, and (3) continuous incorporation of information.",
                "A standard pari-mutuel fails (3).",
                "A CDA fails (1).",

                "Even though technically an MSR exposes its patron to risk (i.e., a variable future payoff), the patrons maximum loss is bounded, so the distinction between a DPM and an MSR in terms of these three properties is more technical than practical.",
                "DPM traders can cash out of the market early, just like stock market traders, to lock in a profit or limit a loss, an action that is simply not possible in a standard pari-mutuel.",
                "A DPM also has some drawbacks.",
                "The payoff for a wager depends both on the price at the time of the trade, and on the final payoff per share at the markets close.",
                "This contrasts with the CDA variants, where the payoff vector across possible future outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade.",

                "If P changes according to a random walk, then traders can take the current P as an unbiased estimate of the final P, greatly decreasing the complexity of their optimization.",
                "If P does not change according to a random walk, the mechanism still has utility as a mechanism for hedging and speculating, though optimization may be difficult, and determining a measure of the markets aggregate opinion of the probabilities of A and B may be difficult.",
                "We discuss the implications of random walk behavior further below in Section 4.1 in the discussion surrounding Assumption 3.",
                "A second drawback of a DPM is its one-sided nature. 173 While an automated market maker always stands ready to accept buy orders, there is no corresponding market maker to accept sell orders.",
                "Traders must sell to each other using a standard CDA mechanism, for example by posting an ask order at a price at or below the market makers current ask price.",
                "Traders can also always hedge-sell by purchasing shares in the opposite outcome from the market maker, thereby hedging their bet if not fully liquidating it. 3.3 Redistribution rule In a standard pari-mutuel market, payoffs can be computed in either of two equivalent ways: (1) each winning $1 wager receives a refund of the initial $1 paid, plus an equal share of all losing wagers, or (2) each winning $1 wager receives an equal share of all wagers, winning or losing.",

                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",

                "But a <br>cda</br> can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful <br>cda</br> must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the <br>cda</br> and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",

                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",

                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",

                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",

                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a <br>cda</br> or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a <br>cda</br>, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a <br>cda</br>, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the <br>cda</br> that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (<br>cda</br>).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A <br>cda</br> constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a <br>cda</br>, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a <br>cda</br>, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a <br>cda</br> with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a <br>cda</br>.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",

                "The instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares is: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the number of shares n that can be purchased for m dollars, as follows: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) Â· Â· Â· n = m(N1 âˆ’ N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln Â» T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) .",
                "Note that we solved for n(m) rather than m(n).",
                "I could not find a closed-form solution for m(n), as was derived for the two other cases above.",
                "Still, n(m) can be used to determine how many shares can be purchased for m dollars, and the inverse function can be approximated to any degree numerically.",
                "From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 âˆ’ m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln Â» T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
                "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B.",
                "This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3).",
                "That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0.",
                "The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even.",
                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
                "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
                "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = Î±M1 and p2 = Î±M2, where Î± > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 Â· 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a <br>cda</br>, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the <br>cda</br>, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar <br>cda</br>, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a <br>cda</br>, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",

                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",

                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",

                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",

                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",

                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
                "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",

                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",

                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",

                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",

                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",

                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",

                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",

                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",

                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the <br>market institution</br>; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the <br>market institution</br> and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the <br>market institution</br>.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the <br>market institution</br>, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the <br>market institution</br>, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the <br>market institution</br> to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the <br>market institution</br>, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the <br>market institution</br>.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",

                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the <br>market institution</br> (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the <br>market institution</br> itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the <br>market institution</br> (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",
                "Denote the two outcomes A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive.",
                "Denote the instantaneous price per share of A as p1 and the price per share of B as p2.",
                "Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively.",
                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",
                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
                "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the <br>market institution</br>, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",
                "For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation.",

                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 Â· 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
                "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",

                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",

                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for <br>selling</br>: instead, <br>selling</br> is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and <br>selling</br> high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",

                "I could not find a closed-form solution for m(n), as was derived for the two other cases above.",
                "Still, n(m) can be used to determine how many shares can be purchased for m dollars, and the inverse function can be approximated to any degree numerically.",
                "From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 âˆ’ m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln Â» T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
                "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B.",
                "This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3).",
                "That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0.",
                "The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even.",
                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
                "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
                "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = Î±M1 and p2 = Î±M2, where Î± > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and <br>selling</br> are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and <br>selling</br> them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by <br>selling</br> the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 Â· 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",

                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",

                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",

                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",

                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their <br>gain</br>s or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
                "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",

                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or <br>loss</br>.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The <br>trader interface</br> can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",

                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",

                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = Î±M1 and p2 = Î±M2, where Î± > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",

                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",

                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",

                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",

                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 Â· 1A.",

                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",

                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
                "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",

                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",

                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty <br>bid-ask queue</br>s if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",

                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",

                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",

                "I could not find a closed-form solution for m(n), as was derived for the two other cases above.",
                "Still, n(m) can be used to determine how many shares can be purchased for m dollars, and the inverse function can be approximated to any degree numerically.",
                "From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 âˆ’ m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln Â» T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
                "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B.",
                "This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3).",
                "That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0.",
                "The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even.",
                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
                "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
                "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = Î±M1 and p2 = Î±M2, where Î± > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 Â· 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",

                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",

                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",

                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",

                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",

                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",

                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",

                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",

                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",

                "The <br>price function</br> determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the <br>price function</br> from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",

                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",

                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",

                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",

                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an <br>automated market maker</br> always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an <br>automated market maker</br> always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided <br>automated market maker</br>, while a DPM provides a one-sided <br>automated market maker</br>.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",

                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",

                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",

                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",

                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 Â· 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an <br>automated market maker</br> willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
                "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",

                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",

                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",

                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",

                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some <br>price</br> automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the <br>price</br> for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its <br>price</br> increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its <br>price</br> decreases.",

                "The <br>price</br> function determines the instantaneous <br>price</br> per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the <br>price</br> is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the <br>price</br> is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid <br>price</br> of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask <br>price</br> of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid <br>price</br> is less than the lowest ask <br>price</br>, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid <br>price</br> and the lowest ask <br>price</br> may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",

                "Solving we get MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) As before, we make the simplifying assumption (3) that the expected final payoff per share equals the current payoff per share.",
                "The assumption is critical for our analysis, but may not be required for a practical implementation. 5.2 <br>price</br> functions For the case where all money is distributed, the constraints (4) that keep the <br>price</br> of A equal to the payoff of B, and vice versa, do not lead to the derivation of a coherent price function.",
                "A reasonable <br>price</br> function can be derived from the constraint (8) employed in Section 4.2.2, where we require that the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered.",
                "That is, p1/p2 = M1/M2.",
                "In other words, the <br>price</br> of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B. 176 Using Equations 3, 8, and 15 we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) Â· T N1 Â· N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) Â· N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Interestingly, this is the same market probability derived in Section 4.2.1 for the case of losing-money redistribution with the constraints that the <br>price</br> of A equal the payoff of B and vice versa.",
                "The instantaneous <br>price</br> per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares is: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Working from the above instantaneous <br>price</br>, we can derive the number of shares n that can be purchased for m dollars, as follows: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) Â· Â· Â· n = m(N1 âˆ’ N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln Â» T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) .",

                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the <br>price</br> paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
                "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",

                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high <br>price</br> that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower <br>price</br>, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the <br>price</br> is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the <br>price</br>.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers <br>price</br>, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",

                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers <br>price</br> only rises, the going <br>price</br> may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",

                "Each <br>price</br> function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",

                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the <br>price</br> set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any <br>price</br>.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask <br>price</br>, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share <br>price</br> paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current <br>price</br> for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current <br>price</br> has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market <br>price</br> (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the <br>price</br> moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers <br>price</br> refunded).",

                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",

                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on <br>price</br> dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied <br>price</br> functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some <br>price</br>.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable <br>price</br> functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",

                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",

                "I have derived the <br>price</br> functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",

                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",
                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
                "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",

                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 Â· 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
                "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",

                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",

                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",

                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",

                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",

                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",

                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",

                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",

                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",

                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",
                "Denote the two outcomes A and B.",

                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",

                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",

                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",

                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/<br>combinatorial bet</br>ting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the <br>trade</br>.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a <br>trade</br> on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",

                "I could not find a closed-form solution for m(n), as was derived for the two other cases above.",
                "Still, n(m) can be used to determine how many shares can be purchased for m dollars, and the inverse function can be approximated to any degree numerically.",
                "From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 âˆ’ m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln Â» T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
                "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B.",
                "This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3).",
                "That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0.",
                "The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even.",
                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
                "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
                "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = Î±M1 and p2 = Î±M2, where Î± > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 Â· 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",

                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",

                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",

                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",

                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",

                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",

                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",

                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",

                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a <br>bet</br> on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who <br>bet</br> on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who <br>bet</br> on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are <br>bet</br> on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who <br>bet</br> on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money <br>bet</br> on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount <br>bet</br>.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is <br>bet</br> on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar <br>bet</br> in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular <br>bet</br>, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to <br>bet</br> early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their <br>bet</br>, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to <br>bet</br> until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a <br>bet</br> that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a <br>bet</br> that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that <br>bet</br> are fixed at the time of the <br>bet</br>.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the <br>bet</br>, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the <br>bet</br>; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a <br>bet</br> is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",
                "Denote the two outcomes A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive.",
                "Denote the instantaneous price per share of A as p1 and the price per share of B as p2.",
                "Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively.",
                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",
                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
                "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",
                "For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation.",
                "Denote M1 as the total amount of money wagered on A, M2 as the total amount of money wagered on B, T = M1 + M2 as the total amount of money wagered on both sides, N1 as the total number of shares purchased of A, and N2 as the total number of shares purchased of B.",
                "There are many ways to formulate the price function.",
                "Several natural price functions are outlined below; each is motivated as the unique solution to a particular constraint on price dynamics. 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages To my knowledge, a DPM is the only known mechanism for hedging and speculating that exhibits all three of the following properties: (1) guaranteed liquidity, (2) no risk for the market institution, and (3) continuous incorporation of information.",

                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 Â· 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
                "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",

                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A âˆ§ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",

                "A reasonable price function can be derived from the constraint (8) employed in Section 4.2.2, where we require that the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered.",
                "That is, p1/p2 = M1/M2.",

                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
                "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
                "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = Î±M1 and p2 = Î±M2, where Î± > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p Â· 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 Â· 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 Â· 1A + P1 Â· 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 Â·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 Â·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5Â·1A and $P1 Â·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2Â·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 Â· 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: â€¢ Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. â€¢ Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? â€¢ Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? â€¢ DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. â€¢ Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. â€¢ Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
