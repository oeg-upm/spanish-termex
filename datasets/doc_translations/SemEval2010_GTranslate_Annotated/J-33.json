BACKGROUND A multiattribute auction is a market-based mechanism where goods are described by vectors of features, or attributes [3, 5, 8, 19]. Such mechanisms provide traders with the ability to negotiate over a multidimensional space of potential deals, delaying commitment to specific configurations until the most promising candidates are identified. For example, in a multiattribute auction for computers, the good may be defined by attributes such as processor speed, memory, and hard disk capacity. Agents have varying preferences (or costs) associated with the possible configurations. For example, a buyer may be willing to purchase a computer with a 2 GHz processor, 500 MB of memory, and a 50 GB hard disk for a price no greater than $500, or the same computer with 1GB of memory for a price no greater than $600. Existing research in multiattribute auctions has focused primarily on one-sided mechanisms, which automate the process whereby a single agent negotiates with multiple potential trading partners [8, 7, 19, 5, 23, 22]. Models of procurement typically assume the buyer has a value function, v, ranging over the possible configurations, X, and that each seller i can similarly be associated with a cost function ci over this domain. The role of the auction is to elicit these functions (possibly approximate or partial versions), and identify the surplus-maximizing deal. In this case, such an outcome would be arg maxi,x v(x) − ci(x). This problem can be translated into the more familiar auction for a single good without attributes by computing a score for each attribute vector based on the seller valuation function, and have buyers bid scores. Analogs of the classic first- and second-price auctions correspond to firstand second-score auctions [8, 7]. In the absence of a published buyer scoring function, agents on both sides may provide partial specifications of the deals they are willing to engage. Research on such auctions has, for example, produced iterative mechanisms for eliciting cost functions incrementally [19]. Other efforts focus on the optimization problem facing the bid taker, for example considering side constraints on the combination of trades comprising an overall deal [4]. Side constraints have also been analyzed in the context of combinatorial auctions [6, 20]. Our emphasis is on two-sided multiattribute auctions, where multiple buyers and sellers submit bids, and the objective is to construct a set of deals maximizing overall surplus. Previous research on such auctions includes works by Fink et al. [12] and Gong [14], both of which consider a matching problem for continuous double auctions (CDAs), where deals are struck whenever a pair of compatible bids is identified. In a call market, in contrast, bids accumulate until designated times (e.g., on a periodic or scheduled basis) at which the auction clears by determining a comprehensive match over the entire set of bids. Because the optimization is performed over an aggregated scope, call markets often enjoy liquidity and efficiency advantages over CDAs [10].1 Clearing a multiattribute CDA is much like clearing a one-sided multiattribute auction. Because nothing happens between bids, the problem is to match a given new bid (say, an offer to buy) with the existing bids on the other (sell) side. Multiattribute call markets are potentially much more complex. Constructing an optimal overall matching may require consideration of many different combina1 In the interim between clears, call markets may also disseminate price quotes providing summary information about the state of the auction [24]. Such price quotes are often computed based on hypothetical clears, and so the clearing algorithm may be invoked more frequently than actual market clearing operations. 110 tions of trades, among the various potential trading-partner pairings. The problem can be complicated by restrictions on overall assignments, as expressed in side constraints [16]. The goal of the present work is to develop a general framework for multiattribute call markets, to enable investigation of design issues and possibilities. In particular, we use the framework to explore tradeoffs between expressive power of agent bids and computational properties of auction clearing. We conduct our exploration independent of any consideration of strategic issues bearing on mechanism design. As with analogous studies of combinatorial auctions [18], we intend that tradeoffs quantified in this work can be combined with incentive factors within a comprehensive overall approach to multiattribute auction design. We provide the formal semantics of multiattribute offers in our framework in the next section. We abstract, where appropriate, from the specific language used to express offers, characterizing expressiveness semantically in terms of what deals may be offered. This enables us to identify some general conditions under which the problem of multilateral matching can be decomposed into bilateral matching problems. We then develop a family of network flow problems that capture corresponding classes of multiattribute call market optimizations. Experimental trials provide preliminary confirmation that the network formulations provide useful structure for implementing clearing algorithms. 2. MULTIATTRIBUTE OFFERS 2.1 Basic Definitions The distinguishing feature of a multiattribute auction is that the goods are defined by vectors of attributes, x = (x1, . . . , xm), xj ∈ Xj . A configuration is a particular attribute vector, x ∈ X = Qm j=1 Xj . The outcome of the auction is a set of bilateral trades. Trade t takes the form t = (x, q, b, s, π), signifying that agent b buys q > 0 units of configuration x from seller s, for payment π > 0. For convenience, we use the notation xt to denote the configuration associated with trade t (and similarly for other elements of t). For a set of trades T, we denote by Ti that subset of T involving agent i (i.e., b = i or s = i). Let T denote the set of all possible trades. A bid expresses an agents willingness to participate in trades. We specify the semantics of a bid in terms of offer sets. Let OT i ⊆ Ti denote agent is trade offer set. Intuitively, this represents the trades in which i is willing to participate. However, since the outcome of the auction is a set of trades, several of which may involve agent i, we must in general consider willingness to engage in trade combinations. Accordingly, we introduce the combination offer set of agent i, OC i ⊆ 2Ti . 2.2 Specifying Offer Sets A fully expressive bid language would allow specification of arbitrary combination offer sets. We instead consider a more limited class which, while restrictive, still captures most forms of multiattribute bidding proposed in the literature. Our bids directly specify part of the agents trade offer set, and include further directives controlling how this can be extended to the full trade and combination offer sets. For example, one way to specify a trade (buy) offer set would be to describe a set of configurations and quantities, along with the maximal payment one would exchange for each (x, q) specified. This description could be by enumeration, or any available means of defining such a mapping. An explicit set of trades in the offer set generally entails inclusion of many more implicit trades. We assume payment monotonicity, which means that agents always prefer more money. That is, for π > π > 0, (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT i ⇒ (x, q, i, s, π ) ∈ OT i , (x, q, b, i, π ) ∈ OT i ⇒ (x, q, b, i, π) ∈ OT i . We also assume free disposal, which dictates that for all i, q > q > 0, (x, q , i, s, π) ∈ OT i ⇒ (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT i , (x, q, b, i, π) ∈ OT i ⇒ (x, q , b, i, π) ∈ OT i . Note that the conditions for agents in the role of buyers and sellers are analogous. Henceforth, for expository simplicity, we present all definitions with respect to buyers only, leaving the definition for sellers as understood. Allowing agents bids to comprise offers from both buyer and seller perspectives is also straightforward. An assertion that offers are divisible entails further implicit members in the trade offer set. DEFINITION 1 (DIVISIBLE OFFER). Agent is offer is divisible down to q iff ∀q < q < q. (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT i ⇒ (x, q , i, s, q q π) ∈ OT i . We employ the shorthand divisible to mean divisible down to 0. The definition above specifies arbitrary divisibility. It would likewise be possible to define divisibility with respect to integers, or to any given finite granularity. Note that when offers are divisible, it suffices to specify one offer corresponding to the maximal quantity one is willing to trade for any given configuration, trading partner, and per-unit payment (called the price). At the extreme of indivisibility are all-or-none offers. DEFINITION 2 (AON OFFER). Agent is offer is all-or-none (AON) iff (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT i ∧ (x, q , i, s, π ) ∈ OT i ⇒ [q = q ∨ π = π ]. In many cases, the agent will be indifferent with respect to different trading partners. In that event, it may omit the partner element from trades directly specified in its offer set, and simply assert that its offer is anonymous. DEFINITION 3 (ANONYMITY). Agent is offer is anonymous iff ∀s, s , b, b . (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT i ⇔ (x, q, i, s , π) ∈ OT i ∧ (x, q, b, i, π) ∈ OT i ⇔ (x, q, b , i, π) ∈ OT i . Because omitting trading partner qualifications simplifies the exposition, we generally assume in the following that all offers are anonymous unless explicitly specified otherwise. Extending to the non-anonymous case is conceptually straightforward. We employ the wild-card symbol ∗ in place of an agent identifier to indicate that any agent is acceptable. To specify a trade offer set, a bidder directly specifies a set of willing trades, along with any regularity conditions (e.g., divisibility, anonymity) that implicitly extend the set. The full trade offer set is then defined by the closure of this direct set with respect to payment monotonicity, free disposal, and any applicable divisibility assumptions. We next consider the specification of combination offer sets. Without loss of generality, we restrict each trade set T ∈ OC i to include at most one trade for any combination of configuration and trading partner (multiple such trades are equivalent to one net trade aggregating the quantities and payments). The key question is to what extent the agent is willing to aggregate deals across configurations or trading partners. One possibility is disallowing any aggregation. 111 DEFINITION 4 (NO AGGREGATION). The no-aggregation combinations are given by ONA i = {∅} ∪ {{t} | t ∈ OT i }. Agent is offer exhibits non-aggregation iff OC i = ONA i . We require in general that OC i ⊇ ONA i . A more flexible policy is to allow aggregation across trading partners, keeping configuration constant. DEFINITION 5 (PARTNER AGGREGATION). Suppose a particular trade is offered in the same context (set of additional trades, T) with two different sellers, s and s . That is, {(x, q, i, s, π)} ∪ T ∈ OC i ∧ {(x, q, i, s , π)} ∪ T ∈ OC i . Agent is offer allows seller aggregation iff in all such cases, {(x, q , i, s, π ), (x, q − q , i, s , π − π )} ∪ T ∈ OC i . In other words, we may create new trade offer combinations by splitting the common trade (quantity and payment, not necessarily proportionately) between the two sellers. In some cases, it might be reasonable to form combinations by aggregating different configurations. DEFINITION 6 (CONFIGURATION AGGREGATION). Suppose agent i offers, in the same context, the same quantity of two (not necessarily different) configurations, x and x . That is, {(x, q, i, ∗, π)} ∪ T ∈ OC i ∧ {(x , q, i, ∗, π )} ∪ T ∈ OC i . Agent is offer allows configuration aggregation iff in all such cases (and analogously when it is a seller), {(x, q , i, ∗, q q π), (x , q − q , i, ∗, q − q q π )} ∪ T ∈ OC i . Note that combination offer sets can accommodate offerings of configuration bundles. However, classes of bundles formed by partner or configuration aggregation are highly regular, covering only a specific type of bundle formed by splitting a desired quantity across configurations. This is quite restrictive compared to the general combinatorial case. 2.3 Willingness to Pay An agents offer trade set implicitly defines the agents willingness to pay for any given configuration and quantity. We assume anonymity to avoid conditioning our definitions on trading partner. DEFINITION 7 (WILLINGNESS TO PAY). Agent is willingness to pay for quantity q of configuration x is given by ˆuB i (x, q) = max π s.t. (x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ OT i . We use the symbol ˆu to recognize that willingness to pay can be viewed as a proxy for the agents utility function, measured in monetary units. The superscript B distinguishes the buyers willingnessto-pay function from, a sellers willingness to accept, ˆuS i (x, q), defined as the minimum payment seller i will accept for q units of configuration x. We omit the superscript where the distinction is inessential or clear from context. DEFINITION 8 (TRADE QUANTITY BOUNDS). Agent is minimum trade quantity for configuration x is given by qi(x) = min q s.t. ∃π. (x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ OT i . The agents maximum trade quantity for x is ¯qi(x) = max q s.t. ∃π. (x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ OT i ∧ ¬∃q < q. (x, q , i, ∗, π) ∈ OT i . When the agent has no offers involving x, we take qi(x) = ¯qi(x) = 0. It is useful to define a special case where all configurations are offered in the same quantity range. DEFINITION 9 (CONFIGURATION PARITY). Agent is offers exhibit configuration parity iff qi(x) > 0 ∧ qi(x ) > 0 ⇒ qi(x) = qi(x ) ∧ ¯qi(x) = ¯qi(x ). Under configuration parity we drop the arguments from trade quantity bounds, yielding the constants ¯q and q which apply to all offers. DEFINITION 10 (LINEAR PRICING). Agent is offers exhibit linear pricing iff for all qi(x) ≤ q ≤ ¯qi(x), ˆui(x, q) = q ¯qi(x) ˆui(x, ¯qi(x)). Note that linear pricing assumes divisibility down to qi(x). Given linear pricing, we can define the unit willingness to pay, ˆui(x) = ˆui(x, ¯qi(x))/¯qi(x), and take ˆui(x, q) = qˆui(x) for all qi(x) ≤ q ≤ ¯qi(x). In general, an agents willingness to pay may depend on a context of other trades the agent is engaging in. DEFINITION 11 (WILLINGNESS TO PAY IN CONTEXT). Agent is willingness to pay for quantity q of configuration x in the context of other trades T is given by ˆuB i (x, q; T) = max π s.t. {(x, q, i, s, π)} ∪ Ti ∈ OC i . LEMMA 1. If OC i is either non aggregating, or exhibits linear pricing, then ˆuB i (x, q; T) = ˆuB i (x, q). 3. MULTIATTRIBUTE ALLOCATION DEFINITION 12 (TRADE SURPLUS). The surplus of trade t = (x, q, b, s, π) is given by σ(t) = ˆuB b (x, q) − ˆuS s (x, q). Note that the trade surplus does not depend on the payment, which is simply a transfer from buyer to seller. DEFINITION 13 (TRADE UNIT SURPLUS). The unit surplus of trade t = (x, q, b, s, π) is given by σ1 (t) = σ(t)/q. Under linear pricing, we can equivalently write σ1 (t) = ˆuB b (x) − ˆuS s (x). DEFINITION 14 (SURPLUS OF A TRADE IN CONTEXT). The surplus of trade t = (x, q, b, s, π) in the context of other trades T, σ(t; T), is given by ˆuB b (x, q; T) − ˆuS s (x, q; T). DEFINITION 15 (GMAP). The Global Multiattribute Allocation Problem (GMAP) is to find the set of acceptable trades maximizing total surplus, max T ∈2T X t∈T σ(t; T \\ {t}) s.t. ∀i. Ti ∈ OC i . DEFINITION 16 (MMP). The Multiattribute Matching Problem (MMP) is to find a best trade for a given pair of traders, MMP(b, s) = arg max t∈OT b ∩OT s σ(t). If OT b ∩ OT s is empty, we say that MMP has no solution. 112 Proofs of all the following results are provided in an extended version of this paper available from the authors. THEOREM 2. Suppose all agents offers exhibit no aggregation (Definition 4). Then the solution to GMAP consists of a set of trades, each of which is a solution to MMP for its specified pair of traders. THEOREM 3. Suppose that each agents offer set satisfies one of the following (not necessarily the same) sets of conditions. 1. No aggregation and configuration parity (Definitions 4 and 9). 2. Divisibility, linear pricing, and configuration parity (Definitions 1, 10, and 9), with combination offer set defined as the minimal set consistent with configuration aggregation (Definition 6).2 Then the solution to GMAP consists of a set of trades, each of which employs a configuration that solves MMP for its specified pair of traders. Let MMPd (b, s) denote a modified version of MMP, where OT b and OT s are extended to assume divisibility (i.e., the offer sets are taken to be their closures under Definition 1). Then we can extend Theorem 3 to allow aggregating agents to maintain AON or minquantity offers as follows. THEOREM 4. Suppose offer sets as in Theorem 3, except that agents i satisfying configuration aggregation need be divisible only down to qi, rather than down to 0. Then the solution to GMAP consists of a set of trades, each of which employs the same configuration as a solution to MMPd for its specified pair of traders. THEOREM 5. Suppose agents b and s exhibit configuration parity, divisibility, and linear pricing, and there exists configuration x such that ˆub(x) − ˆus(x) > 0. Then t ∈ MMPd (b, s) iff xt = arg max x {ˆub(x) − ˆus(x)} qt = min(¯qb, ¯qs). (1) The preceding results signify that under certain conditions, we can divide the global optimization problem into two parts: first find a bilateral trade that maximizes unit surplus for each pair of traders (or total surplus in the non-aggregation case), and then use the results to find a globally optimal set of trades. In the following two sections we investigate each of these subproblems. 4. UTILITY REPRESENTATION AND MMP We turn next to consider the problem of finding a best deal between pairs of traders. The complexity of MMP depends pivotally on the representation by bids of offer sets, an issue we have postponed to this point. Note that issues of utility representation and MMP apply to a broad class of multiattribute mechanisms, beyond the multiattribute call markets we emphasize. For example, the complexity results contained in this section apply equally to the bidding problem faced by sellers in reverse auctions, given a published buyer scoring function. The simplest representation of an offer set is a direct enumeration of configurations and associated quantities and payments. This approach treats the configurations as atomic entities, making no use 2 That is, for such an agent i, OC i is the closure under configuration aggregation of ONA i . of attribute structure. A common and inexpensive enhancement is to enable a trader to express sets of configurations, by specifying subsets of the domains of component attributes. Associating a single quantity and payment with a set of configurations expresses indifference among them; hence we refer to such a set as an indifference range.3 Indifference ranges include the case of attributes with a natural ordering, in which a bid specifies a minimum or maximum acceptable attribute level. The use of indifference ranges can be convenient for MMP. The compatibility of two indifference ranges is simply found by testing set intersection for each attribute, as demonstrated by the decision-tree algorithm of Fink et al. [12]. Alternatively, bidders may specify willingness-to-pay functions ˆu in terms of compact functional forms. Enumeration based representations, even when enhanced with indifference ranges, are ultimately limited by the exponential size of attribute space. Functional forms may avoid this explosion, but only if ˆu reflects structure among the attributes. Moreover, even given a compact specification of ˆu, we gain computational benefits only if we can perform the matching without expanding the ˆu values of an exponential number of configuration points. 4.1 Additive Forms One particularly useful multiattribute representation is known as the additive scoring function. Though this form is widely used in practice and in the academic literature, it is important to stress the assumptions behind it. The theory of multiattribute representation is best developed in the context where ˆu is interpreted as a utility function representing an underlying preference order [17]. We present the premises of additive utility theory in this section, and discuss some generalizations in the next. DEFINITION 17. A set of attributes Y ⊂ X is preferentially independent (PI) of its complement Z = X \\ Y if the conditional preference order over Y given a fixed level Z0 of Z is the same regardless of the choice of Z0 . In other words, the preference order over the projection of X on the attributes in Y is the same for any instantiation of the attributes in Z. DEFINITION 18. X = {x1, . . . , xm} is mutually preferentially independent (MPI) if any subset of X is preferentially independent of its complement. THEOREM 6 ([9]). A preference order over set of attributes X has an additive utility function representation u(x1, . . . , xm) = mX i=1 ui(xi) iff X is mutually preferential independent. A utility function over outcomes including money is quasi-linear if the function can be represented as a function over non-monetary attributes plus payments, π. Interpreting ˆu as a utility function over non-monetary attributes is tantamount to assuming quasi-linearity. Even when quasi-linearity is assumed, however, MPI over nonmonetary attributes is not sufficient for the quasi-linear utility function to be additive. For this, we also need that each of the pairs (π, Xi) for any attribute Xi would be PI of the rest of the attributes. 3 These should not be mistaken with indifference curves, which express dependency between the attributes. Indifference curves can be expressed by the more elaborate utility representations discussed below. 113 This (by MAUT) in turn implies that the set of attributes including money is MPI and the utility function can be represented as u(x1, . . . , xm, π) = mX i=1 ui(xi) + π. Given that form, a willingness-to-pay function reflecting u can be represented additively, as ˆu(x) = mX i=1 ui(xi) In many cases the additivity assumption provides practically crucial simplification of offer set elicitation. In addition to compactness, additivity dramatically simplifies MMP. If both sides provide additive ˆu representations, the globally optimal match reduces to finding the optimal match separately for each attribute. A common scenario in procurement has the buyer define an additive scoring function, while suppliers submit enumerated offer points or indifference ranges. This model is still very amenable to MMP: for each element in a suppliers enumerated set, we optimize each attribute by finding the point in the suppliers allowable range that is most preferred by the buyer. A special type of scoring (more particularly, cost) function was defined by Bichler and Kalagnanam [4] and called a configurable offer. This idea is geared towards procurement auctions: assuming suppliers are usually comfortable with expressing their preferences in terms of cost that is quasi-linear in every attribute, they can specify a price for a base offer, and additional cost for every change in a specific attribute level. This model is essentially a pricing out approach [17]. For this case, MMP can still be optimized on a per-attribute basis. A similar idea has been applied to one-sided iterative mechanisms [19], in which sellers refine prices on a perattribute basis at each iteration. 4.2 Multiattribute Utility Theory Under MPI, the tradeoffs between the attributes in each subset cannot be affected by the value of other attributes. For example, when buying a PC, a weaker CPU may increase the importance of the RAM compared to, say, the type of keyboard. Such relationships cannot be expressed under an additive model. Multiattribute utility theory (MAUT) develops various compact representations of utility functions that are based on weaker structural assumptions [17, 2]. There are several challenges in adapting these techniques to multiattribute bidding. First, as noted above, the theory is developed for utility functions, which may behave differently from willingness-to-pay functions. Second, computational efficiency of matching has not been an explicit goal of most work in the area. Third, adapting such representations to iterative mechanisms may be more challenging. One representation that employs somewhat weaker assumptions than additivity, yet retains the summation structure is the generalized additive (GA) decomposition: u(x) = JX j=1 fj(xj ), xj ∈ Xj , (2) where the Xj are potentially overlapping sets of attributes, together exhausting the space X. A key point from our perspective is that the complexity of the matching is similar to the complexity of optimizing a single function, since the sum function is in the form (2) as well. Recent work by Gonzales and Perny [15] provides an elicitation process for GA decomposable preferences under certainty, as well as an optimization algorithm for the GA decomposed function. The complexity of exact optimization is exponential in the induced width of the graph. However, to become operational for multiattribute bidding this decomposition must be detectable and verifiable by statements over preferences with respect to price outcomes. We are exploring this topic in ongoing work [11]. 5. SOLVING GMAP UNDER ALLOCATION CONSTRAINTS Theorems 2, 3, and 4 establish conditions under which GMAP solutions must comprise elements from constituent MMP solutions. In Sections 5.1 and 5.2, we show how to compute these GMAP solutions, given the MMP solutions, under these conditions. In these settings, traders that aggregate partners also aggregate configurations; hence we refer to them simply as aggregating or nonaggregating. Section 5.3 suggests a means to relax the linear pricing restriction employed in these constructions. Section 5.4 provides strategies for allowing traders to aggregate partners and restrict configuration aggregation at the same time. 5.1 Notation and Graphical Representation Our clearing algorithms are based on network flow formulations of the underlying optimization problem [1]. The network model is based on a bipartite graph, in which nodes on the left side represent buyers, and nodes on the right represent sellers. We denote the sets of buyers and sellers by B and S, respectively. We define two graph families, one for the case of non-aggregating traders (called single-unit), and the other for the case of aggregating traders (called multi-unit).4 For both types, a single directed arc is placed from a buyer i ∈ B to a seller j ∈ S if and only if MMP(i, j) is nonempty. We denote by T(i) the set of potential trading partners of trader i (i.e., the nodes connected to buyer or seller i in the bipartite graph. In the single-unit case, we define the weight of an arc (i, j) as wij = σ(MMP(i, j)). Note that free disposal lets a buy offer receive a larger quantity than desired (and similarly for sell offers). For the multi-unit case, the weights are wij = σ1 (MMP(i, j)), and we associate the quantity ¯qi with the node for trader i. We also use the notation qij for the mathematical formulations to denote partial fulfillment of qt for t = MMP(i, j). 5.2 Handling Indivisibility and Aggregation Constraints Under the restrictions of Theorems 2, 3, or 4, and when the solution to MMP is given, GMAP exhibits strong similarity to the problem of clearing double auctions with assignment constraints [16]. A match in our bipartite representation corresponds to a potential trade in which assignment constraints are satisfied. Network flow formulations have been shown to model this problem under the assumption of indivisibility and aggregation for all traders. The novelty in this part of our work is the use of generalized network flow formulations for more complex cases where aggregation and divisibility may be controlled by traders. Initially we examine the simple case of no aggregation (Theorem 2). Observe that the optimal allocation is simply the solution to the well known weighted assignment problem [1] on the singleunit bipartite graph described above. The set of matches that maximizes the total weight of arcs corresponds to the set of trades that maximizes total surplus. Note that any form of (in)divisibility can 4 In the next section, we introduce a hybrid form of graph accommodating mixes of the two trader categories. 114 also be accommodated in this model via the constituent MMP subproblems. The next formulation solves the case in which all traders fall under case 2 of Theorem 3-that is, all traders are aggregating and divisible, and exhibit linear pricing. This case can be represented using the following linear program, corresponding to our multi-unit graph: max X i∈B,j∈S wij qij s.t. X i∈T (j) qij ≤ ¯qj j ∈ S X j∈T (i) qij ≤ ¯qi i ∈ B qij ≥ 0 j ∈ S, i ∈ B Recall that the qij variables in the solution represent the number of units that buyer i procures from seller j. This formulation is known as the network transportation problem with inequality constraints, for which efficient algorithms are available [1]. It is a well known property of the transportation problem (and flow problems on pure networks in general) that given integer input values, the optimal solution is guaranteed to be integer as well. Figure 1 demonstrates the transformation of a set of bids to a transportation problem instance. Figure 1: Multi-unit matching with two boolean attributes. (a) Bids, with offers to buy in the left column and offers to sell at right. q@p indicates an offer to trade q units at price p per unit. Configurations are described in terms of constraints on attribute values. (b) Corresponding multi-unit assignment model. W represents arc weights (unit surplus), s represents source (exogenous) flow, and t represents sink quantity. The problem becomes significantly harder when aggregation is given as an option to bidders, requiring various enhancements to the basic multi-unit bipartite graph described above. In general, we consider traders that are either aggregating or not, with either divisible or AON offers. Initially we examine a special case, which at the same time demonstrates the hardness of the problem but still carries computational advantages. We designate one side (e.g., buyers) as restrictive (AON and non-aggregating), and the other side (sellers) as unrestrictive (divisible and aggregating). This problem can be represented using the following integer programming formulation: max X i∈B,j∈S wij qij s.t. X i∈T (j) ¯qiqij ≤ ¯qj j ∈ S X j∈T (i) qij ≤ 1 i ∈ B qij ∈ {0, 1} j ∈ S, i ∈ B (3) This formulation is a restriction of the generalized assignment problem (GAP) [13]. Although GAP is known to be NP-hard, it can be solved relatively efficiently by exact or approximate algorithms. GAP is more general than the formulation above as it allows buyside quantities (¯qi above) to be different for each potential seller. That this formulation is NP-hard as well (even the case of a single seller corresponds to the knapsack problem), illustrates the drastic increase in complexity when traders with different constraints are admitted to the same problem instance. Other than the special case above, we found no advantage in limiting AON constraints when traders may specify aggregation constraints. Therefore, the next generalization allows any combination of the two boolean constraints, that is, any trader chooses among four bid types: NI Bid AON and not aggregating. AD Bid allows aggregation and divisibility. AI Bid AON, allows aggregation (quantity can be aggregated across configurations, as long as it sums to the whole amount). ND No aggregation, divisibility (one trade, but smaller quantities are acceptable). To formulate an integer programming representation for the problem, we introduce the following variables. Boolean (0/1) variables ri and rj indicate whether buyer i and seller j participate in the solution (used for AON traders). Another indicator variable, yij , applied to non-aggregating buyer i and seller j, is one iff i trades with j. For aggregating traders, yij is not constrained. max X i∈B,j∈S Wij qij (4a) s.t.

Problem (4) has additional structure as a generalized min-cost flow problem with integral flow.5 A generalized flow network is a network in which each arc may have a gain factor, in addition to the pure network parameters (which are flow limits and costs). Flow in an arc is then multiplied by its gain factor, so that the flow that enters the end node of an arc equals the flow that entered from its start node, multiplied by the gain factor of the arc. The network model can in turn be translated into an IP formulation that captures such structure. The generalized min-cost flow problem is well-studied and has a multitude of efficient algorithms [1]. The faster algorithms are polynomial in the number of arcs and the logarithm of the maximal gain, that is, performance is not strongly polynomial but is polynomial in the size of the input. The main benefit of this graphical formulation to our matching problem is that it provides a very efficient linear relaxation. Integer programming algorithms such as branch-and-bound use solutions to the linear relaxation instance to bound the optimal integer solution. Since network flow algorithms are much faster than arbitrary linear programs (generalized network flow simplex algorithms have been shown to run in practice only 2 or 3 times slower than pure network min-cost flow [1]), we expect a branch-and-bound solver for the matching problem to show improved performance when taking advantage of network flow modeling. The network flow formulation is depicted in Figure 2. Nonrestrictive traders are treated as in Figure 1. For a non-aggregating buyer, a single unit from the source will saturate up to one of the yij for all j, and be multiplied by ¯qi. If i ∈ ND, the end node of yij will function as a sink that may drain up to ¯qi of the entering flow. For i ∈ NI we use an indicator (0/1) arc ri, on which the flow is multiplied by ¯qi. Trader i trades the full quantity iff ri = 1. At the seller side, the end node of a qij arc functions as a source for sellers j ∈ ND, in order to let the flow through yij arcs be 0 or ¯qj. The flow is then multiplied by 1 ¯qj so 0/1 flows enter an end node which can drain either 1 or 0 units. for sellers j ∈ NI arcs rj ensure AON similarly to arcs rj for buyers. Having established this framework, we are ready to accommo5 Constraint (4j) could be omitted (yielding computational savings) if non-integer quantities are allowed. Here and henceforth we assume the harder problem, where divisibility is with respect to integers. date more flexible versions of side constraints. The first generalization is to replace the boolean AON constraint with divisibility down to q, the minimal quantity. In our network flow instance we simply need to turn the node of the constrained trader i (e.g., the node B3 in Figure 2) to a sink that can drain up to ¯qi − qi units of flow. The integer program (4) can be also easily changed to accommodate this extension. Using gains, we can also apply batch size constraints. If a trader specifies a batch size β, we change the gain on the r arcs to β, and set the available flow of its origin to the maximal number of batches ¯qi/β. 5.3 Nonlinear Pricing A key assumption in handling aggregation up to this point is linear pricing, which enables us to limit attention to a single unit price. Divisibility without linear pricing allows expression of concave willingness-to-pay functions, corresponding to convex preference relations. Bidders may often wish to express non-convex offer sets, for example, due to fixed costs or switching costs in production settings [21]. We consider nonlinear pricing in the form of enumerated payment schedules-that is, defining values ˆu(x, q) for a select set of quantities q. For the indivisible case, these points are distinguished in the offer set by satisfying the following: ∃π. (x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ OT i ∧ ¬∃q < q. (x, q , i, ∗, π) ∈ OT i . (cf. Definition 8, which defines the maximum quantity, ¯q, as the largest of these.) For the divisible case, the distinguished quantities are those where the unit price changes, which can be formalized similarly. To handle nonlinear pricing, we augment the network to include flow possibilities corresponding to each of the enumerated quantities, plus additional structure to enforce exclusivity among them. In other words, the network treats the offer for a given quantity as in Section 5.2, and embeds this in an XOR relation to ensure that each trader picks only one of these quantities. Since for each such quantity choice we can apply Theorem 3 or 4, the solution we get is in fact the solution to GMAP. The network representation of the XOR relation (which can be embedded into the network of Figure 2) is depicted in Figure 3. For a trader i with K XOR quantity points, we define dummy variables, zk i , k = 1, . . . , K. Since we consider trades between every pair of quantity points we also have qk ij , k = 1, . . . , K. For buyer i ∈ AI with XOR points at quantities ¯qk i , we replace (4b) with the following constraints: X j∈T (i) qk ij = ¯qk i zk i k = 1, . . . , K KX k=1 zk i = ri zk i ∈ {0, 1} k = 1, . . . , K (5) 5.4 Homogeneity Constraints The model (4) handles constraints over the aggregation of quantities from different trading partners. When aggregation is allowed, the formulation permits trades involving arbitrary combinations of configurations. A homogeneity constraint [4] restricts such combinations, by requiring that configurations aggregated in an overall deal must agree on some or all attributes. 116 Figure 3: Extending the network flow model to express an XOR over quantities. B2 has 3 XOR points for 6, 3, or 5 units. In the presence of homogeneity constraints, we can no longer apply the convenient separation of GMAP into MMP plus global bipartite optimization, as the solution to GMAP may include trades not part of any MMP solution. For example, let buyer b specify an offer for maximum quantity 10 of various acceptable configurations, with a homogeneity constraint over the attribute color. This means b is willing to aggregate deals over different trading partners and configurations, as long as all are the same color. If seller s can provide 5 blue units or 5 green units, and seller s can provide only 5 green units, we may prefer that b and s trade on green units, even if the local surplus of a blue trade is greater. Let {x1, . . . , xH} be attributes that some trader constrains to be homogeneous. To preserve the network flow framework, we need to consider, for each trader, every point in the product domain of these homogeneous attributes. Thus, for every assignment ˆx to the homogeneous attributes, we compute MMP(b, s) under the constraint that configurations are consistent with ˆx. We apply the same approach as in Section 5.3: solve the global optimization, such that the alternative ˆx assignments for each trader are combined under XOR semantics, thus enforcing homogeneity constraints. The size of this network is exponential in the number of homogeneous attributes, since we need a node for each point in the product domain of all the homogeneous attributes of each trader.6 Hence this solution method will only be tractable in applications were the traders can be limited to a small number of homogeneous attributes. It is important to note that the graph needs to include a node only for each point that potentially matches a point of the other side. It is therefore possible to make the problem tractable by limiting one of the sides to a less expressive bidding language, and by that limit the set of potential matches. For example, if sellers submit bounded sets of XOR points, we only need to consider the points in the combined set offered by the sellers, and the reduction to network flow is polynomial regardless of the number of homogeneous attributes. If such simplifications do not apply, it may be preferable to solve the global problem directly as a single optimization problem. We provide the formulation for the special case of divisibility (with respect to integers) and configuration parity. Let i index buyers, j sellers, and H homogeneous attributes. Variable xh ij ∈ Xh represents the value of attribute Xh in the trade between buyer i and seller j. Integer variable qij represents the quantity of the trade (zero for no trade) between i and j. 6 If traders differ on which attributes they express such constraints, we can limit consideration to the relevant alternatives. The complexity will still be exponential, but in the maximum number of homogeneous attributes for any pair of traders. max X i∈B,j∈S [ˆuB i (xij , qij ) − ˆuS j (xij , qij )] X j∈S qij ≤ ¯qi i ∈ B X i∈B qij ≤ ¯qj j ∈ S xh 1j = xh 2j = · · · = x|B|j j ∈ S, h ∈ {1, . . . , H} xh i1 = xh i2 = · · · = xi|S| i ∈ B, h ∈ {1, . . . , H} (6) Table 1 summarizes the mapping we presented from allocation constraints to the complexity of solving GMAP. Configuration parity is assumed for all cases but the first. 6. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We approach the experimental aspect of this work with two objectives. First, we seek a general idea of the sizes and types of clearing problems that can be solved under given time constraints. We also look to compare the performance of a straightforward integer program as in (4) with an integer program that is based on the network formulations developed here. Since we used CPLEX, a commercial optimization tool, the second objective could be achieved to the extent that CPLEX can take advantage of network structure present in a model. We found that in addition to the problem size (in terms of number of traders), the number of aggregating traders plays a crucial role in determining complexity. When most of the traders are aggregating, problems of larger sizes can be solved quickly. For example, our IP model solved instances with 600 buyers and 500 sellers, where 90% of them are aggregating, in less than two minutes. When the aggregating ratio was reduced to 80% for the same data, solution time was just under five minutes. These results motivated us to develop a new network model. Rather than treat non-aggregating traders as a special case, the new model takes advantage of the single-unit nature of non-aggregating trades (treating the aggregating traders as a special case). This new model outperformed our other models on most problem instances, exceptions being those where aggregating traders constitute a vast majority (at least 80%). This new model (Figure 4) has a single node for each non aggregating trader, with a single-unit arc designating a match to another non-aggregating trader. An aggregating trader has a node for each potential match, connected (via y arcs) to a mutual source node. Unlike the previous model we allow fractional flow for this case, representing the traded fraction of the buyers total quantity.7 We tested all three models on random data in the form of bipartite graphs encoding MMP solutions. In our experiments, each trader has a maximum quantity uniformly distributed over [30, 70], and minimum quantity uniformly distributed from zero to maximal quantity. Each buyer/seller pair is selected as matching with probability 0.75, with matches assigned a surplus uniformly distributed over [10, 70]. Whereas the size of the problem is defined by the number of traders on each side, the problem complexity depends on the product |B| × |S|. The tests depicted in Figures 5-7 are for the worst case |B| = |S|, with each data point averaged over six samples. In the figures, the direct IP (4) is designated SW, our first network model (Figure 2) NW, and our revised network model (Figure 4) NW 2. 7 Traded quantity remains integer. 117 Aggregation Hom. attr.

Thus, we cannot fully evaluate the potential gain attributable to network structure. However, the model we built based on the insight from the network structure clearly provided a significant speedup, even without using a special-purpose algorithm. Model NW 2 provided speedups of a factor of 4-10 over the model SW. This was consistent throughout the problem sizes, including the smaller sizes for which the speedup is not visually apparent on the chart. 7. CONCLUSIONS The implementation and deployment of market exchanges requires the development of bidding languages, information feedback policies, and clearing algorithms that are suitable for the target domain, while paying heed to the incentive properties of the resulting mechanisms. For multiattribute exchanges, the space of feasible such mechanisms is constrained by computational limitations imposed by the clearing process. The extent to which the space of feasible mechanisms may be quantified a priori will facilitate the search for such exchanges in the full mechanism design problem. In this work, we investigate the space of two-sided multiattribute auctions, focusing on the relationship between constraints on the offers traders can express through bids, and the resulting computational problem of determining an optimal set of trades. We developed a formal semantic framework for characterizing expressible offers, and introduced some basic classes of restrictions. Our key technical results identify sets of conditions under which the overall matching problem can be separated into first identifying optimal pairwise trades and subsequently optimizing combinations of those trades. Based on these results, we developed network flow models for the overall clearing problem, which facilitate classification of problem versions by computational complexity, and provide guidance for developing solution algorithms and relaxing bidding constraints. 8.

Antecedentes Una subasta de títulos múltiples es un mecanismo basado en el mercado donde los vectores de características o atributos describen los bienes [3, 5, 8, 19]. Dichos mecanismos brindan a los operadores la capacidad de negociar sobre un espacio multidimensional de posibles acuerdos, retrasando el compromiso con configuraciones específicas hasta que se identifiquen los candidatos más prometedores. Por ejemplo, en una subasta de títulos múltiples para computadoras, el bien puede definirse por atributos como la velocidad del procesador, la memoria y la capacidad de disco duro. Los agentes tienen preferencias (o costos) variables asociadas con las posibles configuraciones. Por ejemplo, un comprador puede estar dispuesto a comprar una computadora con un procesador de 2 GHz, 500 MB de memoria y un disco duro de 50 GB por un precio no mayor de $ 500, o la misma computadora con 1 GB de memoria por un precio no más grande.que $ 600. La investigación existente en subastas de títulos múltiples se ha centrado principalmente en mecanismos unilaterales, que automatizan el proceso mediante el cual un solo agente negocia con múltiples socios comerciales potenciales [8, 7, 19, 5, 23, 22]. Los modelos de adquisición generalmente suponen que el comprador tiene una función de valor, V, que varía sobre las posibles configuraciones, X, y que cada vendedor puedo estar asociado de manera similar con una función de costo CI sobre este dominio. El papel de la subasta es provocar estas funciones (posiblemente versiones aproximadas o parciales) e identificar el acuerdo de maximización excedente. En este caso, dicho resultado sería arg maxi, x v (x) - ci (x). Este problema se puede traducir en la subasta más familiar para una sola buena sin atributos calculando una puntuación para cada vector de atributos en función de la función de valoración del vendedor y tienen puntajes de oferta de compradores. Los análogos de las subastas clásicas de primer y segundo precio corresponden a las subastas de primera y segunda puntuación [8, 7]. En ausencia de una función de puntuación del comprador publicada, los agentes de ambos lados pueden proporcionar especificaciones parciales de los acuerdos que están dispuestos a participar. La investigación sobre tales subastas, por ejemplo, ha producido mecanismos iterativos para provocar funciones de costos de forma incremental [19]. Otros esfuerzos se centran en el problema de optimización que enfrenta el tomador de ofertas, por ejemplo, considerando restricciones laterales en la combinación de operaciones que comprenden un acuerdo general [4]. Las restricciones laterales también se han analizado en el contexto de subastas combinatorias [6, 20]. Nuestro énfasis está en las subastas de títulos múltiples de dos lados, donde múltiples compradores y vendedores presentan ofertas, y el objetivo es construir un conjunto de acuerdos que maximicen el excedente general. La investigación previa sobre tales subastas incluye obras de Fink et al.[12] y Gong [14], los cuales consideran un problema de correspondencia para subastas dobles continuas (CDA), donde las ofertas se alcanzan cada vez que se identifica un par de ofertas compatibles. En un mercado de llamadas, en contraste, las ofertas se acumulan hasta los tiempos designados (por ejemplo, por periódica o programada) en la que la subasta se aclara al determinar una coincidencia integral sobre todo el conjunto de ofertas. Debido a que la optimización se realiza durante un alcance agregado, los mercados de llamadas a menudo disfrutan de la liquidez y las ventajas de eficiencia sobre las CDA [10] .1 Eliminación de un CDA multiatribido es muy similar a la limpieza de una subasta de treBe Multiattribute unilateral. Debido a que no sucede nada entre las ofertas, el problema es igualar una nueva oferta dada (por ejemplo, una oferta para comprar) con las ofertas existentes en el otro lado (vender). Los mercados de llamadas de títulos múltiples son potencialmente mucho más complejos. La construcción de una coincidencia general óptima puede requerir la consideración de muchas combinados diferentes1 diferentes en el ínterin entre los claros, los mercados de llamadas también pueden difundir cotizaciones de precios que proporcionan información resumida sobre el estado de la subasta [24]. Dichas cotizaciones de precios a menudo se calculan en función de las claras hipotéticas, por lo que el algoritmo de compensación puede invocarse con más frecuencia que las operaciones reales de compensación del mercado.110 ciones de oficios, entre los diversos emparejamientos potenciales de parejas comerciales. El problema puede complicarse por las restricciones a las tareas generales, como se expresa en las restricciones laterales [16]. El objetivo del presente trabajo es desarrollar un marco general para los mercados de llamadas de tiempo múltiple, para permitir la investigación de problemas y posibilidades de diseño. En particular, utilizamos el marco para explorar las compensaciones entre el poder expresivo de las ofertas de agentes y las propiedades computacionales de la compensación de la subasta. Llevamos a cabo nuestra exploración independiente de cualquier consideración de problemas estratégicos relacionados con el diseño del mecanismo. Al igual que con los estudios análogos de subastas combinatorias [18], tenemos la intención de que las compensaciones cuantificadas en este trabajo se puedan combinar con factores de incentivos dentro de un enfoque general integral para el diseño de subastas de títulos múltiples. Proporcionamos la semántica formal de las ofertas de títulos múltiples en nuestro marco en la siguiente sección. Resumen, cuando corresponde, del lenguaje específico utilizado para expresar ofertas, caracterizando la expresividad semánticamente en términos de qué acuerdos se pueden ofrecer. Esto nos permite identificar algunas condiciones generales bajo las cuales el problema de la coincidencia multilateral puede descomponerse en problemas de correspondencia bilaterales. Luego desarrollamos una familia de problemas de flujo de red que capturan las clases correspondientes de optimizaciones del mercado de llamadas multiagráficas. Los ensayos experimentales proporcionan confirmación preliminar de que las formulaciones de red proporcionan una estructura útil para implementar algoritmos de compensación.2. Multiattribute ofrece 2.1 Definiciones básicas La característica distintiva de una subasta de títulos múltiples es que los bienes están definidos por vectores de atributos, x = (x1, ..., xm), xj ∈ Xj. Una configuración es un vector de atributo particular, x ∈ X = QM J = 1 XJ. El resultado de la subasta es un conjunto de oficios bilaterales. El comercio T toma el formulario t = (x, q, b, s, π), lo que significa que el agente b compra q> 0 unidades de configuración x del vendedor s, para el pago π> 0. Por conveniencia, utilizamos la notación XT para denotar la configuración asociada con el comercio T (y de manera similar para otros elementos de T). Para un conjunto de oficios t, denotamos por ti que subconjunto de t que involucra el agente I (es decir, b = i o s = i). Deje t denotar el conjunto de todas las operaciones posibles. Una oferta expresa una voluntad de agentes para participar en los oficios. Especificamos la semántica de una oferta en términos de conjuntos de ofertas. Déjelo ir ⊆ para denotar el agente es el conjunto de ofertas comerciales. Intuitivamente, esto representa los oficios en los que estoy dispuesto a participar. Sin embargo, dado que el resultado de la subasta es un conjunto de oficios, varios de los cuales pueden involucrar al Agente I, en general debemos considerar la voluntad de participar en combinaciones de comercio. En consecuencia, presentamos el conjunto de ofertas de combinación del Agente I, OC I ⊆ 2ti.2.2 SECTURAS DE OFERTA DE ESPECIFICACIÓN Un lenguaje de oferta totalmente expresivo permitiría la especificación de conjuntos de ofertas de combinación arbitraria. En cambio, consideramos una clase más limitada que, aunque restrictiva, aún captura la mayoría de las formas de licitación múltiple propuesta en la literatura. Nuestras ofertas especifican directamente parte del conjunto de ofertas comerciales de agentes e incluyen directivas adicionales que controlan cómo esto se puede extender a los conjuntos de ofertas de comercio completo y combinación. Por ejemplo, una forma de especificar un conjunto de ofertas de comercio (compra) sería describir un conjunto de configuraciones y cantidades, junto con el pago máximo que se cambiaría por cada (x, q) especificado. Esta descripción podría ser por enumeración, o cualquier medio disponible para definir dicha mapeo. Un conjunto explícito de operaciones en el conjunto de ofertas generalmente implica la inclusión de muchas más operaciones implícitas. Asumimos la monotonicidad de pago, lo que significa que los agentes siempre prefieren más dinero. Es decir, para π> π> 0, (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ Ot i ⇒ (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ Ot i, (x, q, b, i, π) ∈ Ot i ⇒ (x, q, b, i, π) ∈ Ot i. También asumimos la eliminación gratuita, que dicta que para todos los i, q> q> 0, (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ Ot i ⇒ (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ Ot i, ((x, q, b, i, π) ∈ Ot i ⇒ (x, q, b, i, π) ∈ Ot i. Tenga en cuenta que las condiciones para los agentes en el papel de compradores y vendedores son análogas. En adelante, para la simplicidad expositiva, presentamos todas las definiciones con respecto solo a los compradores, dejando la definición de los vendedores como se entiende. Permitir que las ofertas de los agentes comprendan ofertas de perspectivas de comprador y vendedor también es sencillo. Una afirmación que las ofertas son divisibles implica miembros más implícitos en el conjunto de ofertas comerciales. Definición 1 (Oferta divisible). La oferta de agente es divisible hasta Q IFF ∀q <Q <Q.(x, q, i, s, π) ∈ Ot i ⇒ (x, q, i, s, q q π) ∈ Ot i. Empleamos la taquigrafía divisible para que signifique divisible hasta 0. La definición anterior especifica la divisibilidad arbitraria. También sería posible definir la divisibilidad con respecto a los enteros, o a cualquier granularidad finita dada. Tenga en cuenta que cuando las ofertas son divisibles, es suficiente especificar una oferta correspondiente a la cantidad máxima que uno está dispuesto a comerciar por cualquier configuración, socio comercial y pago por unidad (llamado precio). En el extremo de la indivisibilidad hay ofertas de todo o no. Definición 2 (oferta de AON). El agente se ofrece es todo o no (aon) iff (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ Ot i ∧ (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ Ot i ⇒ [q = q ∨ π =π]. En muchos casos, el agente será indiferente con respecto a los diferentes socios comerciales. En ese caso, puede omitir el elemento de socio de las operaciones directamente especificadas en su conjunto de ofertas, y simplemente afirmar que su oferta es anónima. Definición 3 (anonimato). La oferta de agente es anónima IFF ∀S, S, B, b.(x, q, i, s, π) ∈ Ot i ⇔ (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ Ot i ∧ (x, q, b, i, π) ∈ Ot i ⇔ (x, q, Q,b, i, π) ∈ Ot i. Debido a que omitir las calificaciones de los socios comerciales simplifica la exposición, generalmente asumimos a continuación que todas las ofertas son anónimas a menos que se especifique explícitamente lo contrario. Extenderse al caso no anónimo es conceptualmente sencillo. Empleamos el símbolo de la tarjeta salvaje ∗ en lugar de un identificador de agente para indicar que cualquier agente es aceptable. Para especificar un conjunto de ofertas comerciales, un postor especifica directamente un conjunto de operaciones dispuestas, junto con cualquier condición de regularidad (por ejemplo, divisibilidad, anonimato) que implícitamente extiende el conjunto. El conjunto de ofertas de comercio completo se define mediante el cierre de este conjunto directo con respecto a la monotonicidad de pago, la eliminación gratuita y cualquier suposición de divisibilidad aplicable. A continuación, consideramos la especificación de conjuntos de ofertas combinadas. Sin pérdida de generalidad, restringimos cada conjunto de comercio t ∈ Oc I para incluir como máximo una operación para cualquier combinación de configuración y socio comercial (múltiples de dichas operaciones son equivalentes a un comercio neto agregando las cantidades y pagos). La pregunta clave es hasta qué punto el agente está dispuesto a agregar acuerdos entre configuraciones o socios comerciales. Una posibilidad es rechazar cualquier agregación.111 Definición 4 (sin agregación). Las combinaciones de no agregación están dadas por ONA i = {∅} ∪ {{t} |t ∈ Ot i}. El agente es una oferta exhibir no agregación iff oC i = ona i. Requerimos en general que OC i ⊇ ona i. Una política más flexible es permitir la agregación entre los socios comerciales, manteniendo la configuración constante. Definición 5 (agregación de socios). Supongamos que se ofrece un comercio en particular en el mismo contexto (conjunto de operaciones adicionales, t) con dos vendedores diferentes, S y S. Es decir, {(x, q, i, s, π)} ∪ t ∈ Oc i ∧ {(x, q, i, s, π)} ∪ t ∈ Oc i. La oferta de agente permite la agregación del vendedor IFF en todos estos casos, {(x, q, i, s, π), (x, q - q, i, s, π - π)} ∪ t ∈ Oc i. En otras palabras, podemos crear nuevas combinaciones de ofertas comerciales dividiendo el comercio común (cantidad y pago, no necesariamente proporcionalmente) entre los dos vendedores. En algunos casos, puede ser razonable formar combinaciones agregando diferentes configuraciones. Definición 6 (agregación de configuración). Supongamos que el agente I ofrece, en el mismo contexto, la misma cantidad de dos configuraciones (no necesariamente diferentes), x y x. Es decir, {(x, q, i, ∗, π)} ∪ t ∈ Oc i ∧ {(x, q, i, ∗, π)} ∪ t ∈ Oc i. La oferta de agente permite la agregación de configuración IFF en todos estos casos (y análoga cuando es un vendedor), {(x, q, i, ∗, q q π), (x, q - q, i, ∗, q q π)} ∪ t ∈ OC i. Tenga en cuenta que los conjuntos de ofertas combinadas pueden acomodar las ofertas de paquetes de configuración. Sin embargo, las clases de paquetes formados por la agregación de socios o de configuración son altamente regulares, y cubren solo un tipo específico de paquete formado dividiendo una cantidad deseada en todas las configuraciones. Esto es bastante restrictivo en comparación con el caso combinatorio general.2.3 La voluntad de pagar una oferta de agentes, el conjunto comercial define implícitamente los agentes, la voluntad de pagar por cualquier configuración y cantidad determinadas. Asumimos el anonimato para evitar acondicionar nuestras definiciones en el socio comercial. Definición 7 (disposición a pagar). El agente está dispuesto a pagar por la cantidad Q de la configuración x viene dada por ˆub i (x, q) = max π s.t.(x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ Ot i. Utilizamos el símbolo ˆu para reconocer que la disposición a pagar puede verse como un proxy para la función de utilidad de los agentes, medido en unidades monetarias. El SuperScript B distingue la función de la voluntad de los compradores para pagar la función de los vendedores de aceptar, ˆus i (x, q), definido como el vendedor de pago mínimo que aceptaré para Q unidades de configuración x. Omitimos el superíndice donde la distinción es inesciativa o clara del contexto. Definición 8 (límites de cantidad comercial). El agente es una cantidad mínima de comercio para la configuración x viene dada por Qi (x) = min q s.t.∃π.(x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ Ot i. La cantidad comercial máxima de los agentes para x es ¯qi (x) = max q s.t.∃π.(x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ Ot i ∧ ¬∃q <q.(x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ Ot i. Cuando el agente no tiene ofertas que involucren x, tomamos qi (x) = ¯qi (x) = 0. Es útil definir un caso especial donde todas las configuraciones se ofrecen en el mismo rango de cantidad. Definición 9 (paridad de configuración). El agente se ofrece una paridad de configuración de exhibición IFF Qi (x)> 0 ∧ qi (x)> 0 ⇒ qi (x) = qi (x) ∧ ¯qi (x) = ¯qi (x). Bajo la paridad de configuración, eliminamos los argumentos de los límites de la cantidad comercial, produciendo las constantes ¯q y Q que se aplican a todas las ofertas. Definición 10 (precio lineal). El agente se ofrece a las ofertas de precios lineales IFF para todos los qi (x) ≤ q ≤ ¯qi (x), ˆui (x, q) = q ¯qi (x) ˆui (x, ¯qi (x)). Tenga en cuenta que el precio lineal asume la divisibilidad hasta Qi (x). Precios lineales dados, podemos definir la unidad de voluntad de la unidad a pagar, ˆui (x) = ˆui (x, ¯qi (x))/¯qi (x) y tomar ˆui (x, q) = qˆui (x) para todosqi (x) ≤ q ≤ ¯qi (x). En general, los agentes que disposición a pagar pueden depender de un contexto de otras operaciones en las que se está participando el agente. Definición 11 (voluntad de pagar en contexto). El agente está dispuesto a pagar por la cantidad Q de la configuración x en el contexto de otras operaciones t viene dada por ˆub I (x, q; t) = max π s.t.{(x, q, i, s, π)} ∪ ti ∈ Oc i. Lema 1. Si OC I no se agrega o exhibe precios lineales, entonces ˆub i (x, q; t) = ˆub i (x, q).3. Definición de asignación de títulos múltiples 12 (excedente comercial). El excedente del comercio t = (x, q, b, s, π) viene dado por σ (t) = ˆub b (x, q) - ˆus s (x, q). Tenga en cuenta que el excedente comercial no depende del pago, que es simplemente una transferencia del comprador al vendedor. Definición 13 (excedente de la unidad comercial). El excedente de la unidad del comercio t = (x, q, b, s, π) viene dado por σ1 (t) = σ (t)/q. Bajo precios lineales, podemos escribir de manera equivalente σ1 (t) = ˆub b (x) - ˆus s (x). Definición 14 (excedente de un comercio en contexto). El excedente del comercio t = (x, q, b, s, π) en el contexto de otros comercios t, σ (t; t), viene dado por ˆub b (x, q; t) - ˆus s (x,q; t). Definición 15 (GMAP). El problema global de asignación de múltiples tipos múltiples (GMAP) es encontrar el conjunto de operaciones aceptables que maximizan el excedente total, max t ∈2t x t∈T σ (t; t \\ {t}) s.t.∀i. Ti ∈ OC i. Definición 16 (MMP). El problema de coincidencia de títulos múltiples (MMP) es encontrar el mejor comercio para un par dado de comerciantes, MMP (B, S) = arg max t∈Ot b ∩ot s σ (t). Si ot b ∩ ot s está vacío, decimos que MMP no tiene solución.112 Pruebas de todos los siguientes resultados se proporcionan en una versión extendida de este documento disponible de los autores. Teorema 2. Supongamos que todos los agentes ofrecen exhibir no agregación (definición 4). Luego, la solución a GMAP consiste en un conjunto de operaciones, cada una de las cuales es una solución a MMP para su par especificado de operadores. Teorema 3. Supongamos que cada conjunto de agentes ofrece satisfacer uno de los siguientes conjuntos de condiciones (no necesariamente iguales).1. Sin paridad de agregación y configuración (definiciones 4 y 9).2. Divisibilidad, fijación de precios lineales y paridad de configuración (definiciones 1, 10 y 9), con una oferta de combinación establecida como el conjunto mínimo consistente con la agregación de configuración (definición 6) .2 Entonces la solución a GMAP consiste en un conjunto de intercambios, cada uno.de los cuales emplea una configuración que resuelve MMP para su par especificado de comerciantes. Deje que MMPD (B, S) denote una versión modificada de MMP, donde OT B y OT S se extienden para asumir la divisibilidad (es decir, los conjuntos de ofertas se consideran sus cierres bajo la definición 1). Luego podemos extender el Teorema 3 para permitir que los agentes agregados mantengan las ofertas de AON o Minquantity de la siguiente manera. Teorema 4. Supongamos que los conjuntos de ofertas como en el Teorema 3, excepto que los agentes que satisfacen la agregación de configuración deben ser divisibles solo hasta Qi, en lugar de hasta 0. Luego, la solución a GMAP consiste en un conjunto de operaciones, cada una de las cuales emplea la misma configuración que una solución a MMPD para su par especificado de operadores. Teorema 5. Supongamos que los agentes B y S exhiben la paridad de configuración, la divisibilidad y el precio lineal, y existe la configuración x tal que ˆub (x) - ˆus (x)> 0. Entonces t ∈ Mmpd (b, s) iff xt = arg max x {ˆub (x) - ˆus (x)} qt = min (¯qb, ¯qs).(1) Los resultados anteriores significan que, bajo ciertas condiciones, podemos dividir el problema de optimización global en dos partes: primero encontrar un comercio bilateral que maximice el excedente de la unidad para cada par de comerciantes (o excedentes totales en el caso no de la agregación), yLuego use los resultados para encontrar un conjunto de operaciones a nivel mundial. En las siguientes dos secciones investigamos cada uno de estos subproblemas.4. Representación de servicios públicos y MMP, giramos a continuación para considerar el problema de encontrar un mejor trato entre pares de comerciantes. La complejidad de MMP depende fundamentalmente de la representación por ofertas de conjuntos de ofertas, un problema que hemos pospuesto hasta este punto. Tenga en cuenta que los problemas de representación de servicios públicos y MMP se aplican a una amplia clase de mecanismos de típulos múltiples, más allá de los mercados de llamadas de títulos múltiples que enfatizamos. Por ejemplo, los resultados de complejidad contenidos en esta sección se aplican igualmente al problema de licitación que enfrentan los vendedores en subastas inversas, dada una función de puntuación del comprador publicada. La representación más simple de un conjunto de ofertas es una enumeración directa de configuraciones y cantidades y pagos asociados. Este enfoque trata las configuraciones como entidades atómicas, sin hacer uso 2, lo que es, para tal agente I, OC I es el cierre bajo la agregación de configuración de ONA i.de estructura de atributos. Una mejora común y económica es permitir que un operador exprese conjuntos de configuraciones, especificando subconjuntos de los dominios de los atributos de componentes. Asociar una sola cantidad y pago con un conjunto de configuraciones expresa indiferencia entre ellos;Por lo tanto, nos referimos a dicho conjunto como un rango de indiferencia.3 Los rangos de indiferencia incluyen el caso de atributos con un orden natural, en el que una oferta especifica un nivel de atributo mínimo o máximo aceptable. El uso de rangos de indiferencia puede ser conveniente para MMP. La compatibilidad de dos rangos de indiferencia simplemente se encuentra mediante la intersección del conjunto de pruebas para cada atributo, como lo demuestra el algoritmo de árbol de decisión de Fink et al.[12]. Alternativamente, los postores pueden especificar las funciones de voluntad de pago ˆU en términos de formularios funcionales compactos. Las representaciones basadas en la enumeración, incluso cuando se mejoran con rangos de indiferencia, están limitadas en última instancia por el tamaño exponencial del espacio de atributos. Las formas funcionales pueden evitar esta explosión, pero solo si ˆU refleja la estructura entre los atributos. Además, incluso dada una especificación compacta de ˆU, obtenemos beneficios computacionales solo si podemos realizar la coincidencia sin expandir los valores ˆU de un número exponencial de puntos de configuración.4.1 Formas aditivas Una representación múltiple particularmente útil se conoce como la función de puntuación aditiva. Aunque esta forma se usa ampliamente en la práctica y en la literatura académica, es importante enfatizar las suposiciones detrás de ella. La teoría de la representación de títulos múltiples se desarrolla mejor en el contexto donde ˆU se interpreta como una función de utilidad que representa un orden de preferencia subyacente [17]. Presentamos las premisas de la teoría de la utilidad aditiva en esta sección y discutimos algunas generalizaciones en la siguiente. Definición 17. Un conjunto de atributos y ⊂ x es preferentemente independiente (PI) de su complemento z = x \\ y si el orden de preferencia condicional sobre y dado un nivel fijo Z0 de z es el mismo independientemente de la elección de Z0. En otras palabras, el orden de preferencia sobre la proyección de x en los atributos en y es el mismo para cualquier instanciación de los atributos en Z. Definición 18. X = {x1 ,..., xm} es mutuamente preferentemente independiente (MPI) si algún subconjunto de x es preferentemente independiente de su complemento. Teorema 6 ([9]). Un orden de preferencia sobre el conjunto de atributos x tiene una representación de función de utilidad aditiva u (x1, ..., xm) = mx i = 1 ui (xi) iff x es mutuamente preferencial independiente. Una función de utilidad sobre los resultados, incluido el dinero, es cuasi-lineal si la función puede representarse como una función sobre atributos no monetarios más pagos, π.La interpretación de ˆu como una función de utilidad sobre los atributos no monetarios es equivalente a asumir cuasi-linealidad. Sin embargo, incluso cuando se supone cuasi-linealidad, MPI sobre los atributos no monetarios no es suficiente para que la función de utilidad cuasi-lineal sea aditiva. Para esto, también necesitamos que cada uno de los pares (π, xi) para cualquier atributo Xi sea PI del resto de los atributos.3 Estos no deben confundirse con curvas de indiferencia, que expresan dependencia entre los atributos. Las curvas de indiferencia pueden expresarse mediante las representaciones de utilidad más elaboradas que se analizan a continuación.113 Esto (por maut) a su vez implica que el conjunto de atributos que incluyen dinero es MPI y la función de utilidad puede representarse como u (x1, ..., xm, π) = mx i = 1 ui (xi) + π. Dado esa forma, una función de voluntad de pago que refleja U puede representarse aditivamente, como ˆu (x) = mx i = 1 ui (xi) en muchos casos, la suposición de aditividad proporciona una simplificación prácticamente crucial de la oferta establecida. Además de la compacidad, la aditividad simplifica drásticamente MMP. Si ambas partes proporcionan representaciones aditivas ˆU, la coincidencia óptima globalmente se reduce a encontrar la coincidencia óptima por separado para cada atributo. Un escenario común en la adquisición hace que el comprador defina una función de puntuación aditiva, mientras que los proveedores presentan puntos de oferta enumerados o rangos de indiferencia. Este modelo sigue siendo muy susceptible de MMP: para cada elemento en un conjunto de proveedores enumerados, optimizamos cada atributo al encontrar el punto en el rango permitido de los proveedores que más prefiere el comprador. Bichler y Kalagnanam [4] definieron un tipo especial de puntuación (más particularmente, costo). Esta idea está orientada a las subastas de adquisiciones: suponiendo que los proveedores generalmente se sientan cómodos expresando sus preferencias en términos de costo que es cuasi-lineal en cada atributo, pueden especificar un precio para una oferta base y un costo adicional para cada cambio en un atributo específiconivel. Este modelo es esencialmente un enfoque de precios [17]. Para este caso, MMP aún se puede optimizar por atributo. Se ha aplicado una idea similar a los mecanismos iterativos unilaterales [19], en el que los vendedores refinan los precios de perattribución en cada iteración.4.2 Teoría de la utilidad múltiple bajo MPI, las compensaciones entre los atributos en cada subconjunto no pueden verse afectadas por el valor de otros atributos. Por ejemplo, al comprar una PC, una CPU más débil puede aumentar la importancia de la RAM en comparación con, por ejemplo, el tipo de teclado. Dichas relaciones no pueden expresarse bajo un modelo aditivo. La teoría de la utilidad múltiple (MAUT) desarrolla varias representaciones compactas de funciones de utilidad que se basan en supuestos estructurales más débiles [17, 2]. Existen varios desafíos para adaptar estas técnicas a la licitación múltiple. Primero, como se señaló anteriormente, la teoría se desarrolla para las funciones de utilidad, que pueden comportarse de manera diferente a las funciones de disposición a pagar. En segundo lugar, la eficiencia computacional de la coincidencia no ha sido un objetivo explícito de la mayoría del trabajo en el área. Tercero, adaptar tales representaciones a los mecanismos iterativos puede ser más desafiante. Una representación que emplea suposiciones algo más débiles que la aditividad, pero retiene la estructura de suma es la descomposición de aditivos generalizados (GA): u (x) = jx j = 1 fj (xj), xj ∈ Xj, (2) donde los XJ son potencialmenteConjuntos superpuestos de atributos, juntos agotando el espacio X. Un punto clave desde nuestra perspectiva es que la complejidad de la coincidencia es similar a la complejidad de optimizar una sola función, ya que la función de suma también está en la forma (2). El trabajo reciente de Gonzales y Perny [15] proporciona un proceso de obtención para las preferencias descompuestas de GA bajo certeza, así como un algoritmo de optimización para la función descompuesta de GA. La complejidad de la optimización exacta es exponencial en el ancho inducido del gráfico. Sin embargo, para ir funcionando para la licitación de títulos múltiples, esta descomposición debe ser detectable y verificable por declaraciones sobre las preferencias con respecto a los resultados de los precios. Estamos explorando este tema en el trabajo en curso [11].5. Resolver GMAP en los teoremas de restricciones de asignación 2, 3 y 4 Establecer condiciones bajo las cuales las soluciones de GMAP deben comprender elementos de las soluciones MMP constituyentes. En las secciones 5.1 y 5.2, mostramos cómo calcular estas soluciones GMAP, dadas las soluciones MMP, en estas condiciones. En estos configuraciones, los comerciantes que agregan socios también agregan configuraciones;Por lo tanto, nos referimos a ellos simplemente como agregados o no agrupados. La Sección 5.3 sugiere un medio para relajar la restricción de precios lineales empleados en estas construcciones. La Sección 5.4 proporciona estrategias para permitir a los comerciantes agregar socios y restringir la agregación de configuración al mismo tiempo.5.1 Notación y representación gráfica Nuestros algoritmos de compensación se basan en las formulaciones de flujo de red del problema de optimización subyacente [1]. El modelo de red se basa en un gráfico bipartito, en el que los nodos en el lado izquierdo representan compradores, y los nodos a la derecha representan vendedores. Denotamos los conjuntos de compradores y vendedores por B y S, respectivamente. Definimos dos familias gráficas, una para el caso de comerciantes que no se agreguen (llamados una sola unidad) y la otra para el caso de los comerciantes agregados (llamados unidades múltiples) .4 para ambos tipos, se coloca un solo arco dirigidoUn comprador i ∈ B a un vendedor j ∈ S si y solo si mmp (i, j) no está vacío. Denotamos por t (i) el conjunto de posibles socios comerciales del comerciante I (es decir, los nodos conectados al comprador o el vendedor I en el gráfico bipartito. En el caso de una sola unidad, definimos el peso de un arco (i, j) como wij = σ (mmp (i, j)). Tenga en cuenta que la eliminación gratuita permite que una oferta de compra reciba una cantidad mayor de la que se desea (y de manera similar para las ofertas de venta). Para el caso de múltiples unidades, los pesos son wij = σ1 (mmp (i, j)), y asociamos la cantidad ¯qi con el nodo para el comerciante i. También utilizamos la notación QIJ para las formulaciones matemáticas para denotar el cumplimiento parcial de Qt para t = mmp (i, j).5.2 Manejo de la indivisibilidad y las restricciones de agregación bajo las restricciones de los teoremas 2, 3 o 4, y cuando se da la solución a MMP, GMAP exhibe una fuerte similitud con el problema de eliminar las subastas dobles con restricciones de asignación [16]. Una coincidencia en nuestra representación bipartita corresponde a un comercio potencial en el que se cumplen las limitaciones de asignación. Se ha demostrado que las formulaciones de flujo de red modelan este problema bajo el supuesto de indivisibilidad y agregación para todos los comerciantes. La novedad en esta parte de nuestro trabajo es el uso de formulaciones de flujo de red generalizadas para casos más complejos en los que los operadores pueden controlar la agregación y la divisibilidad. Inicialmente examinamos el caso simple de no agregación (Teorema 2). Observe que la asignación óptima es simplemente la solución al problema de asignación ponderado bien conocido [1] en el gráfico bipartito único descrito anteriormente. El conjunto de coincidencias que maximiza el peso total de los arcos corresponde al conjunto de operaciones que maximiza el excedente total. Tenga en cuenta que cualquier forma de divisibilidad (in) puede 4 en la siguiente sección, introducimos una forma híbrida de mezclas de gráficos acomodantes de las dos categorías de comerciantes.114 también se acomodará en este modelo a través de los subproblemas MMP constituyentes. La siguiente formulación resuelve el caso en el que todos los comerciantes se encuentran en el caso 2 del teorema 3-que es que todos los comerciantes están agregando y divisible, y exhiben precios lineales. Este caso se puede representar utilizando el siguiente programa lineal, correspondiente a nuestro gráfico de unidades múltiples: max x i∈B, j∈S wij qij s.t. X i∈T (j) qij ≤ ¯qj j ∈ S x j∈T (i) qij ≤ ¯qi i ∈ B qij ≥ 0 j ∈ S, i ∈ B recuerda que las variables QIJ en la solución representan el número de unidadesEse comprador que adquiere del vendedor j. Esta formulación se conoce como problema de transporte de red con restricciones de desigualdad, para los cuales los algoritmos eficientes están disponibles [1]. Es una propiedad bien conocida del problema de transporte (y los problemas de flujo en las redes puras en general) que dados los valores de entrada entera, se garantiza que la solución óptima también sea entera. La Figura 1 demuestra la transformación de un conjunto de ofertas a una instancia de problema de transporte. Figura 1: coincidencia de unidades múltiples con dos atributos booleanos.(a) Ofertas, con ofertas para comprar en la columna izquierda y ofertas para vender a la derecha.Q@P indica una oferta de intercambiar unidades Q al precio P por unidad. Las configuraciones se describen en términos de restricciones en los valores de atributos.(b) Modelo de asignación de unidades múltiples correspondientes. W representa los pesos de arco (excedente de la unidad), S representa el flujo de fuente (exógeno) y T representa la cantidad del sumidero. El problema se vuelve significativamente más difícil cuando la agregación se da como una opción para los postores, lo que requiere varias mejoras al gráfico bipartito múltiple básico descrito anteriormente. En general, consideramos comerciantes que están agregando o no, con ofertas divisibles o de AON. Inicialmente examinamos un caso especial, que al mismo tiempo demuestra la dureza del problema, pero aún conlleva ventajas computacionales. Designamos un lado (por ejemplo, compradores) como restrictivos (AON y no agrupados), y el otro lado (vendedores) como sin restricciones (divisibles y agregados). Este problema se puede representar utilizando la siguiente formulación de programación de enteros: max x i∈B, j∈S wij qij s.t. X i∈T (j) ¯qiqij ≤ ¯qj j ∈ S x j∈T (i) qij ≤ 1 i ∈ B qij ∈ {0, 1} j ∈ S, i ∈ B (3) Esta formulación es una restricción deEl problema de asignación generalizada (GAP) [13]. Aunque se sabe que GAP es NP-Hard, se puede resolver de manera relativamente eficiente mediante algoritmos exactos o aproximados. La brecha es más general que la formulación anterior, ya que permite que las cantidades de compra (¯qi arriba) sean diferentes para cada vendedor potencial. Que esta formulación también es NP-Hard (incluso el caso de un solo vendedor corresponde al problema de la mochila), ilustra el aumento drástico de la complejidad cuando los comerciantes con diferentes restricciones se admiten en la misma instancia del problema. Además del caso especial anterior, no encontramos ninguna ventaja en limitar las restricciones de AON cuando los comerciantes pueden especificar restricciones de agregación. Por lo tanto, la próxima generalización permite cualquier combinación de las dos restricciones booleanas, es decir, cualquier operador elige entre cuatro tipos de ofertas: NI BID AON y no agregando. La oferta publicitaria permite la agregación y la divisibilidad. AI BID AON, permite la agregación (la cantidad se puede agregar a través de las configuraciones, siempre que se sume a toda la cantidad). Nd sin agregación, divisibilidad (un comercio, pero cantidades más pequeñas son aceptables). Para formular una representación de programación entera para el problema, presentamos las siguientes variables. Las variables booleanas (0/1) RI y RJ indican si el Comprador I y el Vendedor J participan en la solución (utilizada para los comerciantes de AON). Otra variable indicadora, YIJ, aplicada al comprador I y el vendedor J, es una IFF I intercambia con j. Para los comerciantes agregados, Yij no está limitado.max x i∈B, j∈S wij qij (4a) s.t. X j∈T (i) qij = ¯qiri i ∈ Aib (4b) x j∈T (i) qij ≤ ¯qiri i ∈ ADB (4c) x i∈T (j) qij = ¯qirj j ∈ Ais (4d) X i∈T (j) qij ≤ qj rj j ∈ ADS (4e) xij ≤ ¯qiyij i ∈ Ndb, j ∈ T (i) (4f) xij ≤ ¯qj yij j ∈ Nis, i ∈ T (j)(4g) x j∈T (i) yij ≤ ri i ∈ Nib ∪ ndb (4h) x i∈T (j) yij ≤ rj j ∈ Nis ∪ nds (4i) int qij (4j) yij, rj, ri ∈{0, 1} (4K) 115 Figura 2: Modelo de flujo de red generalizado. B1 es un comprador en AD, B2 ∈ Ni, B3 ∈ Ai, B4 ∈ Nd. V 1 es un vendedor en nd, v 2 ∈ Ai, v 4 ∈ AD. Los valores G representan ganancias de arco. El problema (4) tiene una estructura adicional como un problema de flujo de costo mínimo generalizado con flujo integral.5 Una red de flujo generalizada es una red en la que cada arco puede tener un factor de ganancia, además de los parámetros de red puros (que son límites de flujo y los límites de flujocostos). El flujo en un arco se multiplica luego por su factor de ganancia, de modo que el flujo que ingresa al nodo final de un arco es igual al flujo que ingresó desde su nodo de inicio, multiplicado por el factor de ganancia del arco. El modelo de red a su vez se puede traducir a una formulación IP que captura dicha estructura. El problema generalizado de flujo de costo mínimo está bien estudiado y tiene una multitud de algoritmos eficientes [1]. Los algoritmos más rápidos son polinomiales en el número de arcos y el logaritmo de la ganancia máxima, es decir, el rendimiento no es fuertemente polinomio, sino que es polinomio en el tamaño de la entrada. El principal beneficio de esta formulación gráfica para nuestro problema coincidente es que proporciona una relajación lineal muy eficiente. Algoritmos de programación enteros, como soluciones de uso de ramificación y unido a la instancia de relajación lineal para unir la solución entera óptima. Dado que los algoritmos de flujo de red son mucho más rápidos que los programas lineales arbitrarios (se ha demostrado que los algoritmos simplex de flujo de red generalizados se ejecutan en la práctica solo 2 o 3 veces más lentos que el flujo de costo mínimo de red puro [1]), esperamos una rama y unidoSolver para el problema de coincidencia para mostrar un rendimiento mejorado al aprovechar el modelado de flujo de red. La formulación de flujo de red se representa en la Figura 2. Los comerciantes no restrictivos se tratan como en la Figura 1. Para un comprador no agregando, una sola unidad de la fuente se saturará hasta uno de los YIJ para todos J, y se multiplicará por ¯qi. Si i ∈ Nd, el nodo final de YIJ funcionará como un fregadero que puede drenar hasta ¯qi del flujo de entrada. Porque i ∈ Ni usamos un indicador (0/1) arc ri, en el que el flujo se multiplica por ¯qi. Trader I Cerca la cantidad completa IFF RI = 1. En el lado del vendedor, el nodo final de un arco QIJ funciona como fuente para los vendedores j ∈ Nd, para que el flujo a través de YIJ arcs sea 0 o ¯qj. El flujo se multiplica por 1 ¯qj, por lo que los flujos 0/1 ingresan a un nodo final que puede drenar 1 o 0 unidades.Para los vendedores j ∈ Ni arcs rj, asegúrese de AON de manera similar a ARCS RJ para compradores. Habiendo establecido este marco, estamos listos para la restricción de AccoMmo5 (4J) podría omitirse (producir ahorros computacionales) si se permiten cantidades no enteras. Aquí y en adelante asumimos el problema más difícil, donde la divisibilidad es con respecto a los enteros.Fecha de versiones más flexibles de restricciones laterales. La primera generalización es reemplazar la restricción de AON booleano con la divisibilidad hasta Q, la cantidad mínima. En nuestra instancia de flujo de red, simplemente necesitamos convertir el nodo del operador restringido I (por ejemplo, el nodo B3 en la Figura 2) a un fregadero que puede drenar hasta unidades de flujo ¯qi - Qi. El programa entero (4) también se puede cambiar fácilmente para acomodar esta extensión. Usando ganancias, también podemos aplicar restricciones de tamaño por lotes. Si un operador especifica un tamaño de lote β, cambiamos la ganancia en los arcos R a β y establecemos el flujo disponible de su origen al número máximo de lotes ¯qi/β.5.3 Precios no lineales Una suposición clave en el manejo de la agregación hasta este punto es el precio lineal, lo que nos permite limitar la atención a un solo precio unitario. La divisibilidad sin precios lineales permite la expresión de funciones cóncavas de voluntad de pago, correspondientes a las relaciones con preferencia convexa. Los postores a menudo pueden desear expresar conjuntos de ofertas no convexas, por ejemplo, debido a los costos fijos o los costos de cambio en la configuración de producción [21]. Consideramos que el precio no lineal en forma de horarios de pago enumerados, es decir, definir valores ˆu (x, q) para un conjunto selecto de cantidades q. Para el caso indivisible, estos puntos se distinguen en la oferta establecida satisfaciendo lo siguiente: ∃π.(x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ Ot i ∧ ¬∃q <q.(x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ Ot i.(cf. Definición 8, que define la cantidad máxima, ¯q, como la más grande de estos). Para el caso divisible, las cantidades distinguidas son aquellas donde cambia el precio unitario, que puede formalizarse de manera similar. Para manejar los precios no lineales, aumentamos la red para incluir posibilidades de flujo correspondientes a cada una de las cantidades enumeradas, además de una estructura adicional para hacer cumplir la exclusividad entre ellas. En otras palabras, la red trata la oferta de una cantidad determinada como en la Sección 5.2, e incrusta esto en una relación XOR para garantizar que cada comerciante solo elija una de estas cantidades. Dado que para cada uno de los tales opciones de cantidad podemos aplicar el Teorema 3 o 4, la solución que obtenemos es, de hecho, la solución a GMAP. La representación de red de la relación XOR (que puede integrarse en la red de la Figura 2) se representa en la Figura 3. Para un comerciante i con puntos de cantidad K XOR, definimos variables ficticias, Zk I, K = 1 ,..., K. Dado que consideramos los oficios entre cada par de puntos de cantidad, también tenemos QK IJ, K = 1 ,..., K. para el comprador i ∈ Ai con puntos xor en cantidades ¯qk i, reemplazamos (4b) con las siguientes restricciones: x j∈T (i) qk ij = ¯qk i zk i k = 1 ,..., K kx k = 1 zk i = ri zk i ∈ {0, 1} k = 1 ,..., K (5) 5.4 Restricciones de homogeneidad El modelo (4) maneja las limitaciones sobre la agregación de cantidades de diferentes socios comerciales. Cuando se permite la agregación, la formulación permite operaciones que involucran combinaciones arbitrarias de configuraciones. Una restricción de homogeneidad [4] restringe tales combinaciones, al requerir que las configuraciones agregadas en un acuerdo general deben acordar algunos o todos los atributos.116 Figura 3: Extender el modelo de flujo de red para expresar un XOR sobre cantidades. B2 tiene 3 puntos XOR para 6, 3 o 5 unidades. En presencia de limitaciones de homogeneidad, ya no podemos aplicar la separación conveniente de GMAP en MMP más la optimización bipartita global, ya que la solución a GMAP puede incluir oficios que no sean parte de ninguna solución de MMP. Por ejemplo, permita que el Comprador B especifique una oferta para la Cantidad máxima 10 de varias configuraciones aceptables, con una restricción de homogeneidad sobre el color del atributo. Esto significa que B está dispuesto a agregar acuerdos sobre diferentes socios comerciales y configuraciones, siempre que todos sean del mismo color. Si los vendedores pueden proporcionar 5 unidades azules o 5 unidades verdes, y los vendedores pueden proporcionar solo 5 unidades verdes, podemos preferir que B y S funcionen en unidades verdes, incluso si el excedente local de un comercio azul es mayor. Sea {x1 ,..., xh} sean atributos que algún comerciante restringe para ser homogéneos. Para preservar el marco de flujo de red, debemos considerar, para cada operador, cada punto del dominio del producto de estos atributos homogéneos. Por lo tanto, para cada asignación ˆx a los atributos homogéneos, calculamos MMP (b, s) bajo la restricción de que las configuraciones son consistentes con ˆx. Aplicamos el mismo enfoque que en la Sección 5.3: Resuelve la optimización global, de modo que las asignaciones alternativas ˆx para cada operador se combinan bajo XOR semántica, lo que hace cumplir las limitaciones de homogeneidad. El tamaño de esta red es exponencial en el número de atributos homogéneos, ya que necesitamos un nodo para cada punto en el dominio del producto de todos los atributos homogéneos de cada operador.6 Por lo tanto, este método de solución solo será manejable en las aplicaciones donde los operadores puedenser limitado a un pequeño número de atributos homogéneos. Es importante tener en cuenta que el gráfico debe incluir un nodo solo para cada punto que potencialmente coincida con un punto del otro lado. Por lo tanto, es posible hacer que el problema sea manejable limitando uno de los lados a un lenguaje de licitación menos expresivo, y por ese límite el conjunto de posibles coincidencias. Por ejemplo, si los vendedores presentan conjuntos limitados de puntos XOR, solo necesitamos considerar los puntos en el conjunto combinado ofrecidos por los vendedores, y la reducción al flujo de red es polinomio independientemente del número de atributos homogéneos. Si tales simplificaciones no se aplican, puede ser preferible resolver el problema global directamente como un solo problema de optimización. Proporcionamos la formulación para el caso especial de divisibilidad (con respecto a los enteros) y la paridad de configuración. Deje que indexe compradores, J vendedores y h homogéneos atributos. Variable xh ij ∈ XH representa el valor del atributo XH en el comercio entre el comprador I y el vendedor j.La variable entera QIJ representa la cantidad de comercio (cero para no comercio) entre I y J.6 Si los operadores difieren en qué atributos expresan tales restricciones, podemos limitar la consideración a las alternativas relevantes. La complejidad seguirá siendo exponencial, pero en el número máximo de atributos homogéneos para cualquier par de comerciantes.max x i∈B, j∈S [ˆub I (xij, qij) - ˆus j (xij, qij)] x j∈S qij ≤ ¯qi i ∈ B x i∈B qij ≤ ¯qj j ∈ S xh 1j =XH 2J = · · · = X | B | J J ∈ S, H ∈ {1 ,..., H} xh i1 = xh i2 = · · · = xi | s |i ∈ B, h ∈ {1 ,..., H} (6) La Tabla 1 resume el mapeo que presentamos de restricciones de asignación a la complejidad de resolver GMAP. La paridad de configuración se supone para todos los casos, pero el primero.6. Resultados experimentales abordamos el aspecto experimental de este trabajo con dos objetivos. Primero, buscamos una idea general de los tamaños y tipos de problemas de compensación que se pueden resolver bajo limitaciones de tiempo dadas. También buscamos comparar el rendimiento de un programa entero directo como en (4) con un programa entero que se basa en las formulaciones de red desarrolladas aquí. Dado que utilizamos CPLEX, una herramienta de optimización comercial, el segundo objetivo podría lograrse en la medida en que CPLEX puede aprovechar la estructura de la red presente en un modelo. Descubrimos que, además del tamaño del problema (en términos de número de comerciantes), el número de comerciantes agregados juega un papel crucial en la determinación de la complejidad. Cuando la mayoría de los comerciantes se agregan, los problemas de tamaños más grandes se pueden resolver rápidamente. Por ejemplo, nuestro modelo IP resolvió instancias con 600 compradores y 500 vendedores, donde el 90% de ellos se agregan, en menos de dos minutos. Cuando la relación de agregación se redujo al 80% para los mismos datos, el tiempo de solución fue de poco menos de cinco minutos. Estos resultados nos motivaron a desarrollar un nuevo modelo de red. En lugar de tratar a los comerciantes que no se agreguen como un caso especial, el nuevo modelo aprovecha la naturaleza de una sola unidad de las operaciones no agregadas (tratando a los operadores agregados como un caso especial). Este nuevo modelo superó a nuestros otros modelos en la mayoría de los casos problemáticos, las excepciones son aquellas en las que los comerciantes agregados constituyen una gran mayoría (al menos 80%). Este nuevo modelo (Figura 4) tiene un solo nodo para cada comerciante no agregado, con un arco de una sola unidad que designa una coincidencia con otro comerciante no acumulado. Un operador agregado tiene un nodo para cada coincidencia potencial, conectada (a través de y arcos) a un nodo fuente mutuo. A diferencia del modelo anterior, permitimos un flujo fraccional para este caso, que representa la fracción negociada de la cantidad total de los compradores.7 Probamos los tres modelos en datos aleatorios en forma de gráficos bipartitos que codifican soluciones MMP. En nuestros experimentos, cada operador tiene una cantidad máxima distribuida uniformemente sobre [30, 70], y una cantidad mínima distribuida de manera uniforme de cero a la cantidad máxima. Cada par de compradores/vendedor se selecciona como coincidencia con probabilidad 0.75, con coincidencias asignadas un excedente distribuido uniformemente sobre [10, 70]. Mientras que el tamaño del problema se define por el número de comerciantes en cada lado, la complejidad del problema depende del producto | B |× | S |. Las pruebas representadas en las Figuras 5-7 son para el peor de los casos | B |= | S |, con cada punto de datos promediado en seis muestras. En las figuras, la IP directa (4) se designa SW, nuestro primer modelo de red (Figura 2) NW y nuestro modelo de red revisado (Figura 4) NW 2. 7 Cantidad comercializada permanece entera.117 agregación hom.attr.

Por lo tanto, no podemos evaluar completamente la ganancia potencial atribuible a la estructura de la red. Sin embargo, el modelo que construimos en función de la información de la estructura de la red claramente proporcionó una aceleración significativa, incluso sin usar un algoritmo de propósito especial. El modelo NW 2 proporcionó aceleras de un factor de 4-10 sobre el modelo SW. Esto fue consistente a lo largo de los tamaños del problema, incluidos los tamaños más pequeños para los cuales la aceleración no es aparente visualmente en el gráfico.7. Conclusiones La implementación y el despliegue de los intercambios de mercado requiere el desarrollo de lenguajes de licitación, políticas de retroalimentación de información y algoritmos de compensación que sean adecuados para el dominio objetivo, mientras prestan atención a las propiedades de incentivos de los mecanismos resultantes. Para los intercambios de títulos múltiples, el espacio de mecanismos factibles de tales está limitado por las limitaciones computacionales impuestas por el proceso de compensación. La medida en que se puede cuantificar el espacio de mecanismos factibles a priori facilitará la búsqueda de tales intercambios en el problema de diseño de mecanismo completo. En este trabajo, investigamos el espacio de subastas de títulos múltiples de dos caras, centrándose en la relación entre las restricciones en las ofertas que los operadores pueden expresar a través de ofertas y el problema computacional resultante de determinar un conjunto óptimo de operaciones. Desarrollamos un marco semántico formal para caracterizar ofertas expresables e introdujimos algunas clases básicas de restricciones. Nuestros resultados técnicos clave identifican conjuntos de condiciones bajo las cuales el problema de coincidencia general puede separarse en la primera identificación de operaciones óptimas por pares y posteriormente optimizar combinaciones de esas operaciones. En base a estos resultados, desarrollamos modelos de flujo de red para el problema general de compensación, que facilitan la clasificación de las versiones de problemas por complejidad computacional y brindamos orientación para desarrollar algoritmos de solución y relajando las limitaciones de licitación.8.

        "BACKGROUND A multiattribute auction is a market-based mechanism where goods are described by vectors of features, or attributes [3, 5, 8, 19].",
        "Such mechanisms provide traders with the ability to negotiate over a multidimensional space of potential deals, delaying commitment to specific configurations until the most promising candidates are identified.",
        "For example, in a multiattribute auction for computers, the good may be defined by attributes such as processor speed, memory, and hard disk capacity.",
        "Agents have varying preferences (or costs) associated with the possible configurations.",
        "For example, a buyer may be willing to purchase a computer with a 2 GHz processor, 500 MB of memory, and a 50 GB hard disk for a price no greater than $500, or the same computer with 1GB of memory for a price no greater than $600.",
        "Existing research in multiattribute auctions has focused primarily on one-sided mechanisms, which automate the process whereby a single agent negotiates with multiple potential trading partners [8, 7, 19, 5, 23, 22].",
        "Models of procurement typically assume the buyer has a value function, v, ranging over the possible configurations, X, and that each seller i can similarly be associated with a cost function ci over this domain.",
        "The role of the auction is to elicit these functions (possibly approximate or partial versions), and identify the surplus-maximizing deal.",
        "In this case, such an outcome would be arg maxi,x v(x) − ci(x).",
        "This problem can be translated into the more familiar auction for a single good without attributes by computing a score for each attribute vector based on the seller valuation function, and have buyers bid scores.",
        "Analogs of the classic first- and second-price auctions correspond to firstand second-score auctions [8, 7].",
        "In the absence of a published buyer scoring function, agents on both sides may provide partial specifications of the deals they are willing to engage.",
        "Research on such auctions has, for example, produced iterative mechanisms for eliciting cost functions incrementally [19].",
        "Other efforts focus on the optimization problem facing the bid taker, for example considering side constraints on the combination of trades comprising an overall deal [4].",
        "Side constraints have also been analyzed in the context of combinatorial auctions [6, 20].",
        "Our emphasis is on two-sided multiattribute auctions, where multiple buyers and sellers submit bids, and the objective is to construct a set of deals maximizing overall surplus.",
        "Previous research on such auctions includes works by Fink et al. [12] and Gong [14], both of which consider a matching problem for continuous double auctions (CDAs), where deals are struck whenever a pair of compatible bids is identified.",
        "In a call market, in contrast, bids accumulate until designated times (e.g., on a periodic or scheduled basis) at which the auction clears by determining a comprehensive match over the entire set of bids.",
        "Because the optimization is performed over an aggregated scope, call markets often enjoy liquidity and efficiency advantages over CDAs [10].1 Clearing a multiattribute CDA is much like clearing a one-sided multiattribute auction.",
        "Because nothing happens between bids, the problem is to match a given new bid (say, an offer to buy) with the existing bids on the other (sell) side.",
        "Multiattribute call markets are potentially much more complex.",
        "Constructing an optimal overall matching may require consideration of many different combina1 In the interim between clears, call markets may also disseminate price quotes providing summary information about the state of the auction [24].",

        "The problem can be complicated by restrictions on overall assignments, as expressed in side constraints [16].",
        "The goal of the present work is to develop a general framework for multiattribute call markets, to enable investigation of design issues and possibilities.",
        "In particular, we use the framework to explore tradeoffs between expressive power of agent bids and computational properties of auction clearing.",
        "We conduct our exploration independent of any consideration of strategic issues bearing on mechanism design.",

        "Intuitively, this represents the trades in which i is willing to participate.",
        "However, since the outcome of the auction is a set of trades, several of which may involve agent i, we must in general consider willingness to engage in trade combinations.",
        "Accordingly, we introduce the combination offer set of agent i, OC i ⊆ 2Ti . 2.2 Specifying Offer Sets A fully expressive bid language would allow specification of arbitrary combination offer sets.",
        "We instead consider a more limited class which, while restrictive, still captures most forms of multiattribute bidding proposed in the literature.",
        "Our bids directly specify part of the agents trade offer set, and include further directives controlling how this can be extended to the full trade and combination offer sets.",
        "For example, one way to specify a trade (buy) offer set would be to describe a set of configurations and quantities, along with the maximal payment one would exchange for each (x, q) specified.",
        "This description could be by enumeration, or any available means of defining such a mapping.",
        "An explicit set of trades in the offer set generally entails inclusion of many more implicit trades.",
        "We assume payment monotonicity, which means that agents always prefer more money.",
        "That is, for π > π > 0, (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT i ⇒ (x, q, i, s, π ) ∈ OT i , (x, q, b, i, π ) ∈ OT i ⇒ (x, q, b, i, π) ∈ OT i .",

        "In many cases, the agent will be indifferent with respect to different trading partners.",

        "The compatibility of two indifference ranges is simply found by testing set intersection for each attribute, as demonstrated by the decision-tree algorithm of Fink et al. [12].",

        "Enumeration based representations, even when enhanced with indifference ranges, are ultimately limited by the exponential size of attribute space.",

        "Moreover, even given a compact specification of ˆu, we gain computational benefits only if we can perform the matching without expanding the ˆu values of an exponential number of configuration points. 4.1 Additive Forms One particularly useful multiattribute representation is known as the additive scoring function.",
        "Though this form is widely used in practice and in the academic literature, it is important to stress the assumptions behind it.",

        "A utility function over outcomes including money is quasi-linear if the function can be represented as a function over non-monetary attributes plus payments, π. Interpreting ˆu as a utility function over non-monetary attributes is tantamount to assuming quasi-linearity.",
        "Even when quasi-linearity is assumed, however, MPI over nonmonetary attributes is not sufficient for the quasi-linear utility function to be additive.",
        "For this, we also need that each of the pairs (π, Xi) for any attribute Xi would be PI of the rest of the attributes. 3 These should not be mistaken with indifference curves, which express dependency between the attributes.",
        "Indifference curves can be expressed by the more elaborate utility representations discussed below. 113 This (by MAUT) in turn implies that the set of attributes including money is MPI and the utility function can be represented as u(x1, . . . , xm, π) = mX i=1 ui(xi) + π.",
        "Given that form, a willingness-to-pay function reflecting u can be represented additively, as ˆu(x) = mX i=1 ui(xi) In many cases the additivity assumption provides practically crucial simplification of offer set elicitation.",

        "Third, adapting such representations to iterative mechanisms may be more challenging.",

        "We denote by T(i) the set of potential trading partners of trader i (i.e., the nodes connected to buyer or seller i in the bipartite graph.",
        "In the single-unit case, we define the weight of an arc (i, j) as wij = σ(MMP(i, j)).",
        "Note that free disposal lets a buy offer receive a larger quantity than desired (and similarly for sell offers).",

        "The size of this network is exponential in the number of homogeneous attributes, since we need a node for each point in the product domain of all the homogeneous attributes of each trader.6 Hence this solution method will only be tractable in applications were the traders can be limited to a small number of homogeneous attributes.",
        "It is important to note that the graph needs to include a node only for each point that potentially matches a point of the other side.",
        "It is therefore possible to make the problem tractable by limiting one of the sides to a less expressive bidding language, and by that limit the set of potential matches.",
        "For example, if sellers submit bounded sets of XOR points, we only need to consider the points in the combined set offered by the sellers, and the reduction to network flow is polynomial regardless of the number of homogeneous attributes.",

        "First, we seek a general idea of the sizes and types of clearing problems that can be solved under given time constraints.",
        "We also look to compare the performance of a straightforward integer program as in (4) with an integer program that is based on the network formulations developed here.",
        "Since we used CPLEX, a commercial optimization tool, the second objective could be achieved to the extent that CPLEX can take advantage of network structure present in a model.",
        "We found that in addition to the problem size (in terms of number of traders), the number of aggregating traders plays a crucial role in determining complexity.",
        "When most of the traders are aggregating, problems of larger sizes can be solved quickly.",
        "For example, our IP model solved instances with 600 buyers and 500 sellers, where 90% of them are aggregating, in less than two minutes.",
        "When the aggregating ratio was reduced to 80% for the same data, solution time was just under five minutes.",
        "These results motivated us to develop a new network model.",
        "Rather than treat non-aggregating traders as a special case, the new model takes advantage of the single-unit nature of non-aggregating trades (treating the aggregating traders as a special case).",
        "This new model outperformed our other models on most problem instances, exceptions being those where aggregating traders constitute a vast majority (at least 80%).",
        "This new model (Figure 4) has a single node for each non aggregating trader, with a single-unit arc designating a match to another non-aggregating trader.",
        "An aggregating trader has a node for each potential match, connected (via y arcs) to a mutual source node.",
        "Unlike the previous model we allow fractional flow for this case, representing the traded fraction of the buyers total quantity.7 We tested all three models on random data in the form of bipartite graphs encoding MMP solutions.",
        "In our experiments, each trader has a maximum quantity uniformly distributed over [30, 70], and minimum quantity uniformly distributed from zero to maximal quantity.",
        "Each buyer/seller pair is selected as matching with probability 0.75, with matches assigned a surplus uniformly distributed over [10, 70].",
        "Whereas the size of the problem is defined by the number of traders on each side, the problem complexity depends on the product |B| × |S|.",

                "Existing research in multiattribute auctions has focused primarily on one-sided mechanisms, which automate the process whereby a single agent negotiates with multiple potential trading partners [8, 7, 19, 5, 23, 22].",
                "Models of procurement typically assume the buyer has a value function, v, ranging over the possible configurations, X, and that each seller i can similarly be associated with a cost function ci over this domain.",
