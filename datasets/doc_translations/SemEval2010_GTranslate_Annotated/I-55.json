Joint improvements that bring benefits to all parties can be realised by (i) identifying attributes that are not of direct conflict between the parties, (ii) tradeoffs on attributes that are valued differently by different parties, and (iii) searching for values within attributes that could bring more gains to one party while not incurring too much loss on the other party. In this paper we propose an approach for maximising joint gains in automated negotiations by formulating the negotiation problem as a multi-criteria decision making problem and taking advantage of several optimisation techniques introduced by operations researchers and conflict theorists. We use a mediator to protect the negotiating parties from unnecessary disclosure of information to their opponent, while also allowing an objective calculation of maximum joint gains. We separate out attributes that take a finite set of values (simple attributes) from those with continuous values, and we show that for simple attributes, the mediator can determine the Pareto-optimal values. In addition we show that if none of the simple attributes strongly dominates the other simple attributes, then truth telling is an equilibrium strategy for negotiators during the optimisation of simple attributes. We also describe an approach for improving joint gains on non-simple attributes, by moving the parties in a series of steps, towards the Pareto-optimal frontier.

INTRODUCTION Given that negotiation is perhaps one of the oldest activities in the history of human communication, its perhaps surprising that conducted experiments on negotiations have shown that negotiators more often than not reach inefficient compromises [1, 21]. Raiffa [17] and Sebenius [20] provide analyses on the negotiators failure to achieve efficient agreements in practice and their unwillingness to disclose private information due to strategic reasons. According to conflict theorists Lax and Sebenius [13], most negotiation actually involves both integrative and distributive bargaining which they refer to as creating value and claiming value. They argue that negotiation necessarily includes both cooperative and competitive elements, and that these elements exist in tension. Negotiators face a dilemma in deciding whether to pursue a cooperative or a competitive strategy at a particular time during a negotiation. They refer to this problem as the Negotiators Dilemma. We argue that the Negotiators Dilemma is essentially informationbased, due to the private information held by the agents. Such private information contains both the information that implies the agents bottom lines (or, her walk-away positions) and the information that enforces her bargaining strength. For instance, when bargaining to sell a house to a potential buyer, the seller would try to hide her actual reserve price as much as possible for she hopes to reach an agreement at a much higher price than her reserve price. On the other hand, the outside options available to her (e.g. other buyers who have expressed genuine interest with fairly good offers) consist in the information that improves her bargaining strength about which she would like to convey to her opponent. But at the same time, her opponent is well aware of the fact that it is her incentive to boost her bargaining strength and thus will not accept every information she sends out unless it is substantiated by evidence. Coming back to the Negotiators Dilemma, its not always possible to separate the integrative bargaining process from the distributive bargaining process. In fact, more often than not, the two processes interplay with each other making information manipulation become part of the integrative bargaining process. This is because a negotiator could use the information about his opponents interests against her during the distributive negotiation process. That is, a negotiator may refuse to concede on an important conflicting issue by claiming that he has made a major concession (on another issue) to meet his opponents interests even though the concession he made could be insignificant to him. For instance, few buyers would start a bargaining with a dealer over a deal for a notebook computer by declaring that he is most interested in an extended warranty for the item and therefore prepared to pay a high price to get such an extended warranty. Negotiation Support Systems (NSSs) and negotiating software 508 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS agents (NSAs) have been introduced either to assist humans in making decisions or to enable automated negotiation to allow computer processes to engage in meaningful negotiation to reach agreements (see, for instance, [14, 15, 19, 6, 5]). However, because of the Negotiators Dilemma and given even bargaining power and incomplete information, the following two undesirable situations often arise: (i) negotiators reach inefficient compromises, or (ii) negotiators engage in a deadlock situation in which both negotiators refuse to act upon with incomplete information and at the same time do not want to disclose more information. In this paper, we argue for the role of a mediator to resolve the above two issues. The mediator thus plays two roles in a negotiation: (i) to encourage cooperative behaviour among the negotiators, and (ii) to absorb the information disclosure by the negotiators to prevent negotiators from using uncertainty and private information as a strategic device. To take advantage of existing results in negotiation analysis and operations research (OR) literatures [18], we employ multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) theory to allow the negotiation problem to be represented and analysed. Section 2 provides background on MCDM theory and the negotiation framework. Section 3 formulates the problem. In Section 4, we discuss our approach to integrative negotiation. Section 5 discusses the future work with some concluding remarks. 2. BACKGROUND 2.1 Multi-criteria decision making theory Let A denote the set of feasible alternatives available to a decision maker M. As an act, or decision, a in A may involve multiple aspects, we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of attributes j; (j = 1, . . . , m). (Attributes are also referred to as issues, or decision variables.) A typical decision maker also has several objectives X1, . . . , Xk. We assume that Xi, (i = 1, . . . , k), maps the alternatives to real numbers. Thus, a tuple (x1, . . . , xk) = (X1(a), . . . , Xk(a)) denotes the consequence of the act a to the decision maker M. By definition, objectives are statements that delineate the desires of a decision maker. Thus, M wishes to maximise his objectives. However, as discussed thoroughly by Keeney and Raiffa [8], it is quite likely that a decision makers objectives will conflict with each other in that the improved achievement with one objective can only be accomplished at the expense of another. For instance, most businesses and public services have objectives like minimise cost and maximise the quality of services. Since better services can often only be attained for a price, these objectives conflict. Due to the conflicting nature of a decision makers objectives, M usually has to settle at a compromise solution. That is, he may have to choose an act a ∈ A that does not optimise every objective. This is the topic of the multi-criteria decision making theory. Part of the solution to this problem is that M has to try to identify the Pareto frontier in the consequence space {(X1(a), . . . , Xk(a))}a∈A. DEFINITION 1. (Dominant) Let x = (x1, . . . , xk) and x = (x1, . . . , xk) be two consequences. x dominates x iff xi > xi for all i, and the inequality is strict for at least one i. The Pareto frontier in a consequence space then consists of all consequences that are not dominated by any other consequence. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 in which an alternative consists of two attributes d1 and d2 and the decision maker tries to maximise the two objectives X1 and X2. A decision a ∈ A whose consequence does not lie on the Pareto frontier is inefficient. While the Pareto 1x d2 a (X (a),X (a)) d1 1 x2 2 Alternative spaceA Pareto frontier Consequence space optimal consequenc Figure 1: The Pareto frontier frontier allows M to avoid taking inefficient decisions, M still has to decide which of the efficient consequences on the Pareto frontier is most preferred by him. MCDM theorists introduce a mechanism to allow the objective components of consequences to be normalised to the payoff valuations for the objectives. Consequences can then be ordered: if the gains in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2) equals to the losses in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2), then the two consequences C1 and C2 are considered indifferent. M can now construct the set of indifference curves1 in the consequence space (the dashed curves in Fig. 1). The most preferred indifference curve that intersects with the Pareto frontier is in focus: its intersection with the Pareto frontier is the sought after consequence (i.e., the optimal consequence in Fig. 1). 2.2 A negotiation framework A multi-agent negotiation framework consists of: 1. A set of two negotiating agents N = {1, 2}. 2. A set of attributes Att = {α1, . . . , αm} characterising the issues the agents are negotiating over. Each attribute α can take a value from the set V alα; 3. A set of alternative outcomes O. An outcome o ∈ O is represented by an assignment of values to the corresponding attributes in Att. 4. Agents utility: Based on the theory of multiple-criteria decision making [8], we define the agents utility as follows: • Objectives: Agent i has a set of ni objectives, or interests; denoted by j (j = 1, . . . , ni). To measure how much an outcome o fulfills an objective j to an agent i, we use objective functions: for each agent i, we define is interests using the objective vector function fi = [fij ] : O → Rni . • Value functions: Instead of directly evaluating an outcome o, agent i looks at how much his objectives are fulfilled and will make a valuation based on these more basic criteria. Thus, for each agent i, there is a value function σi : Rni → R. In particular, Raiffa [17] shows how to systematically construct an additive value function to each party involved in a negotiation. • Utility: Now, given an outcome o ∈ O, an agent i is able to determine its value, i.e., σi(fi(o)). However, a negotiation infrastructure is usually required to facilitate negotiation. This might involve other mechanisms and factors/parties, e.g., a mediator, a legal institution, participation fees, etc. The standard way to implement such a thing is to allow money 1 In fact, given the k-dimensional space, these should be called indifference surfaces. However, we will not bog down to that level of details. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 509 and side-payments. In this paper, we ignore those side-effects and assume that agent is utility function ui is normalised so that ui : O → [0, 1]. EXAMPLE 1. There are two agents, A and B. Agent A has a task T that needs to be done and also 100 units of a resource R. Agent B has the capacity to perform task T and would like to obtain at least 10 and at most 20 units of the resource R. Agent B is indifferent on any amount between 10 and 20 units of the resource R. The objective functions for both agents A and B are cost and revenue. And they both aim at minimising costs while maximising revenues. Having T done generates for A a revenue rA,T while doing T incurs a cost cB,T to B. Agent B obtains a revenue rB,R for each unit of the resource R while providing each unit of the resource R costs agent A cA,R. Assuming that money transfer between agents is possible, the set Att then contains three attributes: • T, taking values from the set {0, 1}, indicates whether the task T is assigned to agent B; • R, taking values from the set of non-negative integer, indicates the amount of resource R being allocated to agent B; and • MT, taking values from R, indicates the payment p to be transferred from A to B. Consider the outcome o = [T = 1, R = k, MT = p], i.e., the task T is assigned to B, and A allocates to B with k units of the resource R, and A transfers p dollars to B. Then, costA(o) = k.cA,R + p and revA(o) = rA,T ; and costB(o) = cB,T and revA(o) = j k.rB,R + p if 10 ≤ k ≤ 20 p otherwise. And, σi(costi(o), revi(o)) = revi(o) − costi(o), (i = A, B). 3. PROBLEM FORMALISATION Consider Example 1, assume that rA,T = $150 and cB,T = $100 and rB,R = $10 and cA,R = $7. That is, the revenues generated for A exceeds the costs incurred to B to do task T, and B values resource R more highly than the cost for A to provide it. The optimal solution to this problem scenario is to assign task T to agent B and to allocate 20 units of resource R (i.e., the maximal amount of resource R required by agent B) from agent A to agent B. This outcome regarding the resource and task allocation problems leaves payoffs of $10 to agent A and $100 to agent B.2 Any other outcome would leave at least one of the agents worse off. In other words, the presented outcome is Pareto-efficient and should be part of the solution outcome for this problem scenario. However, as the agents still have to bargain over the amount of money transfer p, neither agent would be willing to disclose their respective costs and revenues regarding the task T and the resource R. As a consequence, agents often do not achieve the optimal outcome presented above in practice. To address this issue, we introduce a mediator to help the agents discover better agreements than the ones they might try to settle on. Note that this problem is essentially the problem of searching for joint gains in a multilateral negotiation in which the involved parties hold strategic information, i.e., the integrative part in a negotiation. In order to help facilitate this process, we introduce the role of a neutral mediator. Before formalising the decision problems faced by the mediator and the 2 Certainly, without money transfer to compensate agent A, this outcome is not a fair one. negotiating agents, we discuss the properties of the solution outcomes to be achieved by the mediator. In a negotiation setting, the two typical design goals would be: • Efficiency: Avoid the agents from settling on an outcome that is not Pareto-optimal; and • Fairness: Avoid agreements that give the most of the gains to a subset of agents while leaving the rest with too little. The above goals are axiomatised in Nashs seminal work [16] on cooperative negotiation games. Essentially, Nash advocates for the following properties to be satisfied by solution to the bilateral negotiation problem: (i) it produces only Pareto-optimal outcomes; (ii) it is invariant to affine transformation (to the consequence space); (iii) it is symmetric; and (iv) it is independent from irrelevant alternatives. A solution satisfying Nashs axioms is called a Nash bargaining solution. It then turns out that, by taking the negotiators utilities as its objectives the mediator itself faces a multi-criteria decision making problem. The issues faced by the mediator are: (i) the mediator requires access to the negotiators utility functions, and (ii) making (fair) tradeoffs between different agents utilities. Our methods allow the agents to repeatedly interact with the mediator so that a Nash solution outcome could be found by the parties. Informally, the problem faced by both the mediator and the negotiators is construction of the indifference curves. Why are the indifference curves so important? • To the negotiators, knowing the options available along indifference curves opens up opportunities to reach more efficient outcomes. For instance, consider an agent A who is presenting his opponent with an offer θA which she refuses to accept. Rather than having to concede, A could look at his indifference curve going through θA and choose another proposal θA. To him, θA and θA are indifferent but θA could give some gains to B and thus will be more acceptable to B. In other words, the outcome θA is more efficient than θA to these two negotiators. • To the mediator, constructing indifference curves requires a measure of fairness between the negotiators. The mediator needs to determine how much utility it needs to take away from the other negotiators to give a particular negotiator a specific gain G (in utility). In order to search for integrative solutions within the outcome space O, we characterise the relationship between the agents over the set of attributes Att. As the agents hold different objectives and have different capacities, it may be the case that changing between two values of a specific attribute implies different shifts in utility of the agents. However, the problem of finding the exact Paretooptimal set3 is NP-hard [2]. Our approach is thus to solve this optimisation problem in two steps. In the first steps, the more manageable attributes will be solved. These are attributes that take a finite set of values. The result of this step would be a subset of outcomes that contains the Pareto-optimal set. In the second step, we employ an iterative procedure that allows the mediator to interact with the negotiators to find joint improvements that move towards a Pareto-optimal outcome. This approach will not work unless the attributes from Att 3 The Pareto-optimal set is the set of outcomes whose consequences (in the consequence space) correspond to the Pareto frontier. 510 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) are independent. Most works on multi-attribute, or multi-issue, negotiation (e.g. [17]) assume that the attributes or the issues are independent, resulting in an additive value function for each agent.4 ASSUMPTION 1. Let i ∈ N and S ⊆ Att. Denote by ¯S the set Att \\ S. Assume that vS and vS are two assignments of values to the attributes of S and v1 ¯S, v2 ¯S are two arbitrary value assignments to the attributes of ¯S, then (ui([vS, v1 ¯S]) − ui([vS, v2 ¯S])) = (ui([vS, v1 ¯S])−ui([vS, v2 ¯S])). That is, the utility function of agent i will be defined on the attributes from S independently of any value assignment to other attributes. 4. MEDIATOR-BASED BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS As discussed by Lax and Sebenius [13], under incomplete information the tension between creating and claiming values is the primary cause of inefficient outcomes. This can be seen most easily in negotiations involving two negotiators; during the distributive phase of the negotiation, the two negotiatorss objectives are directly opposing each other. We will now formally characterise this relationship between negotiators by defining the opposition between two negotiating parties. The following exposition will be mainly reproduced from [9]. Assuming for the moment that all attributes from Att take values from the set of real numbers R, i.e., V alj ⊆ R for all j ∈ Att. We further assume that the set O = ×j∈AttV alj of feasible outcomes is defined by constraints that all parties must obey and O is convex. Now, an outcome o ∈ O is just a point in the m-dimensional space of real numbers. Then, the questions are: (i) from the point of view of an agent i, is o already the best outcome for i? (ii) if o is not the best outcome for i then is there another outcome o such that o gives i a better utility than o and o does not cause a utility loss to the other agent j in comparison to o? The above questions can be answered by looking at the directions of improvement of the negotiating parties at o, i.e., the directions in the outcome space O into which their utilities increase at point o. Under the assumption that the parties utility functions ui are differentiable concave, the set of all directions of improvement for a party at a point o can be defined in terms of his most preferred, or gradient, direction at that point. When the gradient direction ∇ui(o) of agent i at point o is outright opposing to the gradient direction ∇uj (o) of agent j at point o then the two parties strongly disagree at o and no joint improvements can be achieved for i and j in the locality surrounding o. Since opposition between the two parties can vary considerably over the outcome space (with one pair of outcomes considered highly antagonistic and another pair being highly cooperative), we need to describe the local properties of the relationship. We begin with the opposition at any point of the outcome space Rm . The following definition is reproduced from [9]: DEFINITION 2. 1. The parties are in local strict opposition at a point x ∈ Rm iff for all points x ∈ Rm that are sufficiently close to x (i.e., for some > 0 such that ∀x x −x < ), an increase of one utility can be achieved only at the expense of a decrease of the other utility. 2. The parties are in local non-strict opposition at a point x ∈ Rm iff they are not in local strict opposition at x, i.e., iff it is possible for both parties to raise their utilities by moving an infinitesimal distance from x. 4 Klein et al. [10] explore several implications of complex contracts in which attributes are possibly inter-dependent. 3. The parties are in local weak opposition at a point x ∈ Rm iff ∇u1(x).∇u2(x) ≥ 0, i.e., iff the gradients at x of the two utility functions form an acute or right angle. 4. The parties are in local strong opposition at a point x ∈ Rm iff ∇u1(x).∇u2(x) < 0, i.e., iff the gradients at x form an obtuse angle. 5. The parties are in global strict (nonstrict, weak, strong) opposition iff for every x ∈ Rm they are in local strict (nonstrict, weak, strong) opposition. Global strict and nonstrict oppositions are complementary cases. Essentially, under global strict opposition the whole outcome space O becomes the Pareto-optimal set as at no point in O can the negotiating parties make a joint improvement, i.e., every point in O is a Pareto-efficient outcome. In other words, under global strict opposition the outcome space O can be flattened out into a single line such that for each pair of outcomes x, y ∈ O, u1(x) < u1(y) iff u2(x) > u2(y), i.e., at every point in O, the gradient of the two utility functions point to two different ends of the line. Intuitively, global strict opposition implies that there is no way to obtain joint improvements for both agents. As a consequence, the negotiation degenerates to a distributive negotiation, i.e., the negotiating parties should try to claim as much shares from the negotiation issues as possible while the mediator should aim for the fairness of the division. On the other hand, global nonstrict opposition allows room for joint improvements and all parties might be better off trying to realise the potential gains by reaching Pareto-efficient agreements. Weak and strong oppositions indicate different levels of opposition. The weaker the opposition, the more potential gains can be realised making cooperation the better strategy to employ during negotiation. On the other hand, stronger opposition suggests that the negotiating parties tend to behave strategically leading to misrepresentation of their respective objectives and utility functions and making joint gains more difficult to realise. We have been temporarily making the assumption that the outcome space O is the subset of Rm . In many real-world negotiations, this assumption would be too restrictive. We will continue our exposition by lifting this restriction and allowing discrete attributes. However, as most negotiations involve only discrete issues with a bounded number of options, we will assume that each attribute takes values either from a finite set or from the set of real numbers R. In the rest of the paper, we will refer to attributes whose values are from finite sets as simple attributes and attributes whose values are from R as continuous attributes. The notions of local oppositions, i.e., strict, nonstrict, weak and strong, are not applicable to outcome spaces that contain simple attributes and nor are the notions of global weak and strong oppositions. However, the notions of global strict and nonstrict oppositions can be generalised for outcome spaces that contain simple attributes. DEFINITION 3. Given an outcome space O, the parties are in global strict opposition iff ∀x, y ∈ O, u1(x) < u1(y) iff u2(x) > u2(y). The parties are in global nonstrict opposition if they are not in global strict opposition. 4.1 Optimisation on simple attributes In order to extract the optimal values for a subset of attributes, in the first step of this optimisation process the mediator requests the negotiators to submit their respective utility functions over the set of simple attributes. Let Simp ⊆ Att denote the set of all simple attributes from Att. Note that, due to Assumption 1, agent is The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 511 utility function can be characterised as follows: ui([vSimp, vSimp]) = wi 1 ∗ ui,1([vSimp]) + wi 2 ∗ ui,2([vSimp]), where Simp = Att \\ Simp, and ui,1 and ui,2 are the utility components of ui over the sets of attributes Simp and Simp, respectively, and 0 < wi 1, wi 2 < 1 and wi 1 + wi 2 = 1. As attributes are independent of each other regarding the agents utility functions, the optimisation problem over the attributes from Simp can be carried out by fixing ui([vSimp]) to a constant C, and then search for the optimal values within the set of attributes Simp. Now, how does the mediator determine the optimal values for the attributes in Simp? Several well-known optimisation strategies could be applicable here: • The utilitarian solution: The sum of the agents utilities are maximised. Thus, the optimal values are the solution of the following optimisation problem: arg max v∈V alSimp X i∈N ui(v) • The Nash solution: The product of the agents utilities are maximised. Thus, the optimal values are the solution of the following optimisation problem: arg max v∈V alSimp Y i∈N ui(v) • The egalitarian solution (aka. the maximin solution): The utility of the agent with minimum utility is maximised. Thus, the optimal values are the solution of the following optimisation problem: arg max v∈V alSimp min i∈N ui(v) The question now is of course whether a negotiator has the incentive to misrepresent his utility function. First of all, recall that the agents utility functions are bounded, i.e., ∀o ∈ O.0 ≤ ui(o) ≤ 1. Thus, the agents have no incentive to overstate their utility regarding an outcome o: If o is the most preferred outcome to an agent i then he already assigns the maximal utility to o. On the other hand, if o is not the most preferred outcome to i then by overstating the utility he assigns to o, the agent i runs the risk of having to settle on an agreement which would give him less payoffs than he is supposed to receive. However, agents do have an incentive to understate their utility if the final settlement will be based on the above solutions alone. Essentially, the mechanism to avoid an agent to understate his utility regarding particular outcomes is to guarantee a certain measure of fairness for the final settlement. That is, the agents lose the incentive to be dishonest to obtain gains from taking advantage of the known solutions to determine the settlement outcome for they would be offset by the fairness maintenance mechanism. Firsts, we state an easy lemma. LEMMA 1. When Simp contains one single attributes, the agents have the incentive to understate their utility functions regarding outcomes that are not attractive to them. By way of illustration, consider the set Simp containing only one attribute that could take values from the finite set {A, B, C, D}. Assume that negotiator 1 assigns utilities of 0.4, 0.7, 0.9, and 1 to A, B, C, and D, respectively. Assume also that negotiator 2 assigns utilities of 1, 0.9, 0.7, and 0.4 to A, B, C, and D, respectively. If agent 1 misrepresents his utility function to the mediator by reporting utility 0 for all values A, B and C and utility 1 for value D then the agent 2 who plays honestly in his report to the mediator will obtain the worst outcome D given any of the above solutions. Note that agent 1 doesnt need to know agent 2s utility function, nor does he need to know the strategy employed by agent 2. As long as he knows that the mediator is going to employ one of the above three solutions, then the above misrepresentation is the dominant strategy for this game. However, when the set Simp contains more than one attribute and none of the attributes strongly dominate the other attributes then the above problem disminishes by itself thanks to the integrative solution. We of course have to define clearly what it means for an attribute to strongly dominate other attributes. Intuitively, if most of an agents utility concentrates on one of the attributes then this attribute strongly dominates other attributes. We again appeal to the Assumption 1 on additivity of utility functions to achieve a measure of fairness within this negotiation setting. Due to Assumption 1, we can characterise agent is utility component over the set of attributes Simp by the following equation: ui,1([vSimp]) = X j∈Simp wi j ∗ ui,j([vj]) (1) where P j∈Simp wj = 1. Then, an attribute ∈ Simp strongly dominates the rest of the attributes in Simp (for agent i) iff wi > P j∈(Simp− ) wi j . Attribute is said to be strongly dominant (for agent i) wrt. the set of simple attributes Simp. The following theorem shows that if the set of attributes Simp does not contain a strongly dominant attribute then the negotiators have no incentive to be dishonest. THEOREM 1. Given a negotiation framework, if for every agent the set of simple attributes doesnt contain a strongly dominant attribute, then truth-telling is an equilibrium strategy for the negotiators during the optimisation of simple attributes. So far, we have been concentrating on the efficiency issue while leaving the fairness issue aside. A fair framework does not only support a more satisfactory distribution of utility among the agents, but also often a good measure to prevent misrepresentation of private information by the agents. Of the three solutions presented above, the utilitarian solution does not support fairness. On the other hand, Nash [16] proves that the Nash solution satisfies the above four axioms for the cooperative bargaining games and is considered a fair solution. The egalitarian solution is another mechanism to achieve fairness by essentially helping the worst off. The problem with these solutions, as discussed earlier, is that they are vulnerable to strategic behaviours when one of the attributes strongly dominates the rest of attributes. However, there is yet another solution that aims to guarantee fairness, the minimax solution. That is, the utility of the agent with maximum utility is minimised. Its obvious that the minimax solution produces inefficient outcomes. However, to get around this problem (given that the Pareto-optimal set can be tractably computed), we can apply this solution over the Pareto-optimal set only. Let POSet ⊆ V alSimp be the Pareto-optimal subset of the simple outcomes, the minimax solution is defined to be the solution of the following optimisation problem. arg min v∈P OSet max i∈N ui(v) While overall efficiency often suffers under a minimax solution, i.e., the sum of all agents utilities are often lower than under other solutions, it can be shown that the minimax solution is less vulnerable to manipulation. 512 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) THEOREM 2. Given a negotiation framework, under the minimax solution, if the negotiators are uncertain about their opponents preferences then truth-telling is an equilibrium strategy for the negotiators during the optimisation of simple attributes. That is, even when there is only one single simple attribute, if an agent is uncertain whether the other agents most preferred resolution is also his own most preferred resolution then he should opt for truth-telling as the optimal strategy. 4.2 Optimisation on continuous attributes When the attributes take values from infinite sets, we assume that they are continuous. This is similar to the common practice in operations research in which linear programming solutions/techniques are applied to integer programming problems. We denote the number of continuous attributes by k, i.e., Att = Simp ∪ Simp and |Simp| = k. Then, the outcome space O can be represented as follows: O = ( Q j∈Simp V alj) × ( Q l∈Simp V all), where Q l∈Simp V all ⊆ Rk is the continuous component of O. Let Oc denote the set Q l∈Simp V all. Well refer to Oc as the feasible set and assume that Oc is closed and convex. After carrying out the optimisation over the set of simple attributes, we are able to assign the optimal values to the simple attributes from Simp. Thus, we reduce the original problem to the problem of searching for optimal (and fair) outcomes within the feasible set Oc . Recall that, by Assumption 1, we can characterise agent is utility function as follows: ui([v∗ Simp, vSimp]) = C + wi 2 ∗ ui,2([vSimp]), where C is the constant wi 1 ∗ ui,1([v∗ Simp]) and v∗ Simp denotes the optimal values of the simple attributes in Simp. Hence, without loss of generality (albeit with a blatant abuse of notation), we can take the agent is utility function as ui : Rk → [0, 1]. Accordingly we will also take the set of outcomes under consideration by the agents to be the feasible set Oc . We now state another assumption to be used in this section: ASSUMPTION 2. The negotiators utility functions can be described by continuously differentiable and concave functions ui : Rk → [0, 1], (i = 1, 2). It should be emphasised that we do not assume that agents explicitly know their utility functions. For the method to be described in the following to work, we only assume that the agents know the relevant information, e.g. at certain point within the feasible set Oc , the gradient direction of their own utility functions and some section of their respective indifference curves. Assume that a tentative agreement (which is a point x ∈ Rk ) is currently on the table, the process for the agents to jointly improve this agreement in order to reach a Pareto-optimal agreement can be described as follows. The mediator asks the negotiators to discretely submit their respective gradient directions at x, i.e., ∇u1(x) and ∇u2(x). Note that the goal of the process to be described here is to search for agreements that are more efficient than the tentative agreement currently on the table. That is, we are searching for points x within the feasible set Oc such that moving to x from the current tentative agreement x brings more gains to at least one of the agents while not hurting any of the agents. Due to the assumption made above, i.e. the feasible set Oc is bounded, the conditions for an alternative x ∈ Oc to be efficient vary depending on the position of x. The following results are proved in [9]: Let B(x) = 0 denote the equation of the boundary of Oc , defining x ∈ Oc iff B(x) ≥ 0. An alternative x∗ ∈ Oc is efficient iff, either A. x∗ is in the interior of Oc and the parties are in local strict opposition at x∗ , i.e., ∇u1(x∗ ) = −γ∇u2(x∗ ) (2) where γ > 0; or B. x∗ is on the boundary of Oc , and for some α, β ≥ 0: α∇u1(x∗ ) + β∇u2(x∗ ) = ∇B(x∗ ) (3) We are now interested in answering the following questions: (i) What is the initial tentative agreement x0? (ii) How to find the more efficient agreement xh+1, given the current tentative agreement xh? 4.2.1 Determining a fair initial tentative agreement It should be emphasised that the choice of the initial tentative agreement affects the fairness of the final agreement to be reached by the presented method. For instance, if the initial tentative agreement x0 is chosen to be the most preferred alternative to one of the agents then it is also a Pareto-optimal outcome, making it impossible to find any joint improvement from x0. However, if x0 will then be chosen to be the final settlement and if x0 turns out to be the worst alternative to the other agent then this outcome is a very unfair one. Thus, its important that the choice of the initial tentative agreement be sensibly made. Ehtamo et al [3] present several methods to choose the initial tentative agreement (called reference point in their paper). However, their goal is to approximate the Pareto-optimal set by systematically choosing a set of reference points. Once an (approximate) Pareto-optimal set is generated, it is left to the negotiators to decide which of the generated Pareto-optimal outcomes to be chosen as the final settlement. That is, distributive negotiation will then be required to settle the issue. We, on the other hand, are interested in a fair initial tentative agreement which is not necessarily efficient. Improving a given tentative agreement to yield a Pareto-optimal agreement is considered in the next section. For each attribute j ∈ Simp, an agent i will be asked to discretely submit three values (from the set V alj): the most preferred value, denoted by pvi,j, the least preferred value, denoted by wvi,j, and a value that gives i an approximately average payoff, denoted by avi,j. (Note that this is possible because the set V alj is bounded.) If pv1,j and pv2,j are sufficiently close, i.e., |pv1,j − pv2,j| < Δ for some pre-defined Δ > 0, then pv1,j and pv2,j are chosen to be the two core values, denoted by cv1 and cv2. Otherwise, between the two values pv1,j and av1,j, we eliminate the one that is closer to wv2,j, the remaining value is denoted by cv1. Similarly, we obtain cv2 from the two values pv2,j and av2,j. If cv1 = cv2 then cv1 is selected as the initial value for the attribute j as part of the initial tentative agreement. Otherwise, without loss of generality, we assume that cv1 < cv2. The mediator selects randomly p values mv1, . . . , mvp from the open interval (cv1, cv2), where p ≥ 1. The mediator then asks the agents to submit their valuations over the set of values {cv1, cv2, mv1, . . . , mvp}. The value whose the two valuations of two agents are closest is selected as the initial value for the attribute j as part of the initial tentative agreement. The above procedure guarantees that the agents do not gain by behaving strategically. By performing the above procedure on every attribute j ∈ Simp, we are able to identify the initial tentative agreement x0 such that x0 ∈ Oc . The next step is to compute a new tentative agreement from an existing tentative agreement so that the new one would be more efficient than the existing one. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 513 4.2.2 Computing new tentative agreement Our procedure is a combination of the method of jointly improving direction introduced by Ehtamo et al [4] and a method we propose in the coming section. Basically, the idea is to see how strong the opposition the parties are in. If the two parties are in (local) weak opposition at the current tentative agreement xh, i.e., their improving directions at xh are close to each other, then the compromise direction proposed by Ehtamo et al [4] is likely to point to a better agreement for both agents. However, if the two parties are in local strong opposition at the current point xh then its unclear whether the compromise direction would really not hurt one of the agents whilst bringing some benefit to the other. We will first review the method proposed by Ehtamo et al [4] to compute the compromise direction for a group of negotiators at a given point x ∈ Oc . Ehtamo et al define a a function T(x) that describes the mediators choice for a compromise direction at x. For the case of two-party negotiations, the following bisecting function, denoted by T BS , can be defined over the interior set of Oc . Note that the closed set Oc contains two disjoint subsets: Oc = Oc 0 ∪Oc B , where Oc 0 denotes the set of interior points of Oc and Oc B denotes the boundary of Oc . The bisecting compromise is defined by a function T BS : Oc 0 → R2 , T BS (x) = ∇u1(x) ∇u1(x) + ∇u2(x) ∇u2(x) , x ∈ Oc 0. (4) Given the current tentative agreement xh (h ≥ 0), the mediator has to choose a point xh+1 along d = T(xh) so that all parties gain. Ehtamo et al then define a mechanism to generate a sequence of points and prove that when the generated sequence is bounded and when all generated points (from the sequence) belong to the interior set Oc 0 then the sequence converges to a weakly Paretooptimal agreement [4, pp. 59-60].5 As the above mechanism does not work at the boundary points of Oc , we will introduce a procedure that works everywhere in an alternative space Oc . Let x ∈ Oc and let θ(x) denote the angle between the gradients ∇u1(x) and ∇u2(x) at x. That is, θ(x) = arccos( ∇u1(x).∇u2(x) ∇u1(x) . ∇u2(x) ) From Definition 2, it is obvious that the two parties are in local strict opposition (at x) iff θ(x) = π, and they are in local strong opposition iff π ≥ θ(x) > π/2, and they are in local weak opposition iff π/2 ≥ θ(x) ≥ 0. Note also that the two vectors ∇u1(x) and ∇u2(x) define a hyperplane, denoted by h∇(x), in the kdimensional space Rk . Furthermore, there are two indifference curves of agents 1 and 2 going through point x, denoted by IC1(x) and IC2(x), respectively. Let hT1(x) and hT2(x) denote the tangent hyperplanes to the indifference curves IC1(x) and IC2(x), respectively, at point x. The planes hT1(x) and hT2(x) intersect h∇(x) in the lines IS1(x) and IS2(x), respectively. Note that given a line L(x) going through the point x, there are two (unit) vectors from x along L(x) pointing to two opposite directions, denoted by L+ (x) and L− (x). We can now informally explain our solution to the problem of searching for joint gains. When it isnt possible to obtain a compromise direction for joint improvements at a point x ∈ Oc either because the compromise vector points to the space outside of the feasible set Oc or because the two parties are in local strong opposition at x, we will consider to move along the indifference curve of one party while trying to improve the utility of the other party. As 5 Let S be the set of alternatives, x∗ is weakly Pareto optimal if there is no x ∈ S such that ui(x) > ui(x∗ ) for all agents i. the mediator does not know the indifference curves of the parties, he has to use the tangent hyperplanes to the indifference curves of the parties at point x. Note that the tangent hyperplane to a curve is a useful approximation of the curve in the immediate vicinity of the point of tangency, x. We are now describing an iteration step to reach the next tentative agreement xh+1 from the current tentative agreement xh ∈ Oc . A vector v whose tail is xh is said to be bounded in Oc if ∃λ > 0 such that xh +λv ∈ Oc . To start, the mediator asks the negotiators for their gradients ∇u1(xh) and ∇u2(xh), respectively, at xh. 1. If xh is a Pareto-optimal outcome according to equation 2 or equation 3, then the process is terminated. 2. If 1 ≥ ∇u1(xh).∇u2(xh) > 0 and the vector T BS (xh) is bounded in Oc then the mediator chooses the compromise improving direction d = T BS (xh) and apply the method described by Ehtamo et al [4] to generate the next tentative agreement xh+1. 3. Otherwise, among the four vectors ISσ i (xh), i = 1, 2 and σ = +/−, the mediator chooses the vector that (i) is bounded in Oc , and (ii) is closest to the gradient of the other agent, ∇uj (xh)(j = i). Denote this vector by T G(xh). That is, we will be searching for a point on the indifference curve of agent i, ICi(xh), while trying to improve the utility of agent j. Note that when xh is an interior point of Oc then the situation is symmetric for the two agents 1 and 2, and the mediator has the choice of either finding a point on IC1(xh) to improve the utility of agent 2, or finding a point on IC2(xh) to improve the utility of agent 1. To decide on which choice to make, the mediator has to compute the distribution of gains throughout the whole process to avoid giving more gains to one agent than to the other. Now, the point xh+1 to be generated lies somewhere on the intersection of ICi(xh) and the hyperplane defined by ∇ui(xh) and T G(xh). This intersection is approximated by T G(xh). Thus, the sought after point xh+1 can be generated by first finding a point yh along the direction of T G(xh) and then move from yh to the same direction of ∇ui(xh) until we intersect with ICi(xh). Mathematically, let ζ and ξ denote the vectors T G(xh) and ∇ui(xh), respectively, xh+1 is the solution to the following optimisation problem: max λ1,λ2∈L uj(xh + λ1ζ + λ2ξ) s.t. xh+λ1ζ+λ2ξ ∈ Oc , and ui(xh+λ1ζ+λ2ξ) = ui(xh), where L is a suitable interval of positive real numbers; e.g., L = {λ|λ > 0}, or L = {λ|a < λ ≤ b}, 0 ≤ a < b. Given an initial tentative agreement x0, the method described above allows a sequence of tentative agreements x1, x2, . . . to be iteratively generated. The iteration stops whenever a weakly Pareto optimal agreement is reached. THEOREM 3. If the sequence of agreements generated by the above method is bounded then the method converges to a point x∗ ∈ Oc that is weakly Pareto optimal. 5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we have established a framework for negotiation that is based on MCDM theory for representing the agents objectives and utilities. The focus of the paper is on integrative negotiation in which agents aim to maximise joint gains, or create value. 514 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) We have introduced a mediator into the negotiation in order to allow negotiators to disclose information about their utilities, without providing this information to their opponents. Furthermore, the mediator also works toward the goal of achieving fairness of the negotiation outcome. That is, the approach that we describe aims for both efficiency, in the sense that it produces Pareto optimal outcomes (i.e. no aspect can be improved for one of the parties without worsening the outcome for another party), and also for fairness, which chooses optimal solutions which distribute gains amongst the agents in some appropriate manner. We have developed a two step process for addressing the NP-hard problem of finding a solution for a set of integrative attributes, which is within the Pareto-optimal set for those attributes. For simple attributes (i.e. those which have a finite set of values) we use known optimisation techniques to find a Paretooptimal solution. In order to discourage agents from misrepresenting their utilities to gain an advantage, we look for solutions that are least vulnerable to manipulation. We have shown that as long as one of the simple attributes does not strongly dominate the others, then truth telling is an equilibrium strategy for the negotiators during the stage of optimising simple attributes. For non-simple attributes we propose a mechanism that provides stepwise improvements to move the proposed solution in the direction of a Paretooptimal solution. The approach presented in this paper is similar to the ideas behind negotiation analysis [18]. Ehtamo et al [4] presents an approach to searching for joint gains in multi-party negotiations. The relation of their approach to our approach is discussed in the preceding section. Lai et al [12] provide an alternative approach to integrative negotiation. While their approach was clearly described for the case of two-issue negotiations, the generalisation to negotiations with more than two issues is not entirely clear. Zhang et at [22] discuss the use of integrative negotiation in agent organisations. They assume that agents are honest. Their main result is an experiment showing that in some situations, agents cooperativeness may not bring the most benefits to the organisation as a whole, while giving no explanation. Jonker et al [7] consider an approach to multi-attribute negotiation without the use of a mediator. Thus, their approach can be considered a complement of ours. Their experimental results show that agents can reach Paretooptimal outcomes using their approach. The details of the approach have currently been shown only for bilateral negotiation, and while we believe they are generalisable to multiple negotiators, this work remains to be done. There is also future work to be done in more fully characterising the outcomes of the determination of values for the non-simple attributes. In order to provide a complete framework we are also working on the distributive phase using the mediator.

En este documento, proponemos un enfoque para maximizar las ganancias conjuntas en las negociaciones automatizadas formulando el problema de negociación como un problema de toma de decisiones de criterios múltiples y aprovechar varias técnicas de optimización introducidas por los investigadores de operaciones y los teóricos de conflictos. Utilizamos un mediador para proteger a las partes negociantes de la divulgación innecesaria de la información a su oponente, al tiempo que permite un cálculo objetivo de las ganancias articulares máximas. Separamos atributos que toman un conjunto finito de valores (atributos simples) de aquellos con valores continuos, y mostramos que para atributos simples, el mediador puede determinar los valores pareto-óptimos. Además, mostramos que si ninguno de los atributos simples domina fuertemente los otros atributos simples, entonces la verdad de verdad es una estrategia de equilibrio para los negociadores durante la optimización de atributos simples. También describimos un enfoque para mejorar las ganancias conjuntas en atributos no simples, moviendo a las partes en una serie de pasos, hacia la frontera de Pareto-Optimal.

Introducción Dada que la negociación es quizás una de las actividades más antiguas en la historia de la comunicación humana, es quizás sorprendente que haya realizado experimentos sobre las negociaciones que hayan demostrado que los negociadores la mayoría de las veces alcanzan compromisos ineficientes [1, 21]. Raiffa [17] y Sebenius [20] proporcionan análisis sobre los negociadores que no logran acuerdos eficientes en la práctica y su falta de voluntad para divulgar información privada debido a razones estratégicas. Según los teóricos de conflicto Lax y Sebenius [13], la mayoría de la negociación en realidad implica negociación integradora y distributiva a la que se refieren como valor de creación y valor de reclamación. Argumentan que la negociación necesariamente incluye elementos cooperativos y competitivos, y que estos elementos existen en tensión. Los negociadores enfrentan un dilema al decidir si perseguir una estrategia cooperativa o competitiva en un momento particular durante una negociación. Se refieren a este problema como el dilema de los negociadores. Argumentamos que el dilema de los negociadores se basa esencialmente en la información, debido a la información privada en poder de los agentes. Dicha información privada contiene tanto la información que implica los resultados de los agentes (o sus posiciones de visaje) como la información que hace cumplir su fuerza de negociación. Por ejemplo, al negociar para vender una casa a un comprador potencial, el vendedor intentaría ocultar su precio de reserva real tanto como sea posible porque espera llegar a un acuerdo a un precio mucho más alto que su precio de reserva. Por otro lado, las opciones exteriores disponibles para ella (por ejemplo, otros compradores que han expresado un interés genuino con las ofertas bastante buenas) consisten en la información que mejora su fuerza de negociación sobre la cual le gustaría transmitir a su oponente. Pero al mismo tiempo, su oponente es muy consciente del hecho de que es su incentivo aumentar su fuerza de negociación y, por lo tanto, no aceptará cada información que envíe a menos que esté corroborada por la evidencia. Volviendo al dilema de los negociadores, no siempre es posible separar el proceso de negociación integradora del proceso de negociación distributiva. De hecho, la mayoría de las veces, los dos procesos se interactúan entre sí, haciendo que la manipulación de la información se convierta en parte del proceso de negociación integradora. Esto se debe a que un negociador podría usar la información sobre los intereses de sus oponentes contra ella durante el proceso de negociación distributiva. Es decir, un negociador puede negarse a conceder en un tema importante en conflicto al afirmar que ha hecho una concesión importante (en otro tema) para cumplir con los intereses de sus oponentes a pesar de que la concesión que hizo podría ser insignificante para él. Por ejemplo, pocos compradores comenzarían una negociación con un concesionario por un acuerdo para una computadora de cuaderno al declarar que está más interesado en una garantía extendida para el artículo y, por lo tanto, preparado para pagar un alto precio para obtener una garantía tan extendida. Sistemas de soporte de negociación (NSSS) y el software de negociación 508 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 Se han introducido agentes de Ifaamas (NSA) para ayudar a los humanos a tomar decisiones o permitir una negociación automatizada para permitir que los procesos de la computadora se involucrenen una negociación significativa para alcanzar acuerdos (ver, por ejemplo, [14, 15, 19, 6, 5]). Sin embargo, debido al dilema de los negociadores y a la que se le da un poder de negociación e información incompleta, a menudo surgen las siguientes dos situaciones indeseables: (i) los negociadores alcanzan compromisos ineficientes, o (ii) los negociadores participan en una situación de punto muerto en la que ambos negociadores se niegan a actuar sobreCon información incompleta y al mismo tiempo no desea divulgar más información. En este artículo, defendemos el papel de un mediador para resolver los dos problemas anteriores. Por lo tanto, el mediador desempeña dos roles en una negociación: (i) alentar el comportamiento cooperativo entre los negociadores, y (ii) absorber la divulgación de información por parte de los negociadores para evitar que los negociadores usen la incertidumbre y la información privada como un dispositivo estratégico. Para aprovechar los resultados existentes en el análisis de negociación y la investigación de operaciones (o) literaturas [18], empleamos la teoría de la toma de decisiones de criterios múltiples (MCDM) para permitir que el problema de negociación se represente y analice. La Sección 2 proporciona antecedentes sobre la teoría MCDM y el marco de negociación. La Sección 3 formula el problema. En la Sección 4, discutimos nuestro enfoque de negociación integradora. La Sección 5 discute el trabajo futuro con algunos comentarios finales.2. Antecedentes 2.1 Teoría de la toma de decisiones de criterios múltiples Permitir un denotando el conjunto de alternativas factibles disponibles para un tomador de decisiones M. Como acto, o decisión, en un puede involucrar múltiples aspectos, generalmente describimos las alternativas con un conjunto de atributos j;(J = 1, ..., M).(Los atributos también se conocen como cuestiones o variables de decisión). Un tomador de decisiones típico también tiene varios objetivos x1 ,..., Xk. Asumimos que Xi, (i = 1, ..., k), mapea las alternativas a los números reales. Por lo tanto, una tupla (x1, ..., xk) = (x1 (a), ..., xk (a)) denota la consecuencia de la Ley A al tomador de decisiones M.Los deseos de un tomador de decisiones. Por lo tanto, M desea maximizar sus objetivos. Sin embargo, como lo discutieron a fondo Keeney y Raiffa [8], es muy probable que los objetivos de los tomadores de decisiones entren en conflicto entre sí, ya que el logro mejorado con un objetivo solo se puede lograr a expensas de otro. Por ejemplo, la mayoría de las empresas y los servicios públicos tienen objetivos como minimizar el costo y maximizar la calidad de los servicios. Dado que los mejores servicios a menudo solo se pueden alcanzar por un precio, estos objetivos entran en conflicto. Debido a la naturaleza conflictiva de los objetivos de los tomadores de decisiones, M generalmente tiene que establecerse en una solución de compromiso. Es decir, puede tener que elegir un acto a ∈ A que no optimice cada objetivo. Este es el tema de la teoría de la toma de decisiones de criterios múltiples. Parte de la solución a este problema es que M tiene que tratar de identificar la frontera de Pareto en el espacio de consecuencia {(x1 (a), ..., xk (a))} a∈A. Definición 1. (dominante) Sea x = (x1, ..., xk) y x = (x1, ..., xk) Sea dos consecuencias.X domina x IFF xi> xi para todo i, y la desigualdad es estricta para al menos un i. La frontera de Pareto, en una consecuencia, consiste en todas las consecuencias que no están dominadas por ninguna otra consecuencia. Esto se ilustra en la Fig. 1 en el que una alternativa consta de dos atributos D1 y D2 y el tomador de decisiones intenta maximizar los dos objetivos X1 y X2. Una decisión a ∈ A cuya consecuencia no se encuentra en la frontera de Pareto es ineficiente. Mientras que el Pareto 1x d2 a (x (a), x (a)) d1 1 x2 2 spacea alternativa pareto frontera consecuencia espacio óptimo consecuencia de la Figura 1: la frontera de la frontera de pareto permite evitar tomar decisiones ineficientes, M todavía tiene que decidir cuálDe las consecuencias eficientes en la frontera de Pareto es más preferida por él. Los teóricos de MCDM introducen un mecanismo para permitir que los componentes objetivos de las consecuencias se normalicen a las valoraciones de pago para los objetivos. Las consecuencias se pueden ordenar: si las ganancias en satisfacción provocadas por C1 (en comparación con C2) es igual a las pérdidas en la satisfacción provocadas por C1 (en comparación con C2), entonces las dos consecuencias C1 y C2 se consideran indiferentes. M ahora puede construir el conjunto de curvas de indiferencia1 en el espacio de consecuencia (las curvas discontinuas en la Fig. 1). La curva de indiferencia más preferida que se cruza con la frontera de Pareto está en foco: su intersección con la frontera de Pareto es la consecuencia solicitada (es decir, la consecuencia óptima en la Fig. 1).2.2 Un marco de negociación Un marco de negociación de múltiples agentes consiste en: 1. Un conjunto de dos agentes negociadores n = {1, 2}.2. Un conjunto de atributos ATT = {α1 ,..., αM} Caracterización de los problemas sobre los que los agentes están negociando. Cada atributo α puede tomar un valor del conjunto V ALα;3. Un conjunto de resultados alternativos O. Un resultado o ∈ O está representado por una asignación de valores a los atributos correspondientes en ATT.4. Utilidad de agentes: según la teoría de la toma de decisiones de criterios múltiples [8], definimos la utilidad de los agentes de la siguiente manera: • Objetivos: el agente I tiene un conjunto de objetivos o intereses de NI;denotado por J (J = 1, ..., Ni). Para medir cuánto resultado un resultado de un objetivo J a un agente I, usamos funciones objetivas: para cada agente I, definimos es intereses utilizando la función de vector objetivo fi = [fiJ]: o → rni.• Funciones de valor: en lugar de evaluar directamente un resultado o, agente, mira cuánto se cumplen sus objetivos y harán una valoración basada en estos criterios más básicos. Por lo tanto, para cada agente I, hay una función de valor σi: RNI → R. En particular, Raiffa [17] muestra cómo construir sistemáticamente una función de valor aditivo para cada parte involucrada en una negociación.• Utilidad: ahora, dado un resultado o ∈ O, un agente I puede determinar su valor, es decir, σi (fi (o)). Sin embargo, generalmente se requiere una infraestructura de negociación para facilitar la negociación. Esto podría involucrar otros mecanismos y factores/partidos, por ejemplo, un mediador, una institución legal, tarifas de participación, etc. La forma estándar de implementar tal cosa es permitir el dinero 1 De hecho, dado el espacio K-dimensional, estas deberían llamarse superficies de indiferencia. Sin embargo, no nos atascaremos a ese nivel de detalles. El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 509 y pagos secundarios. En este artículo, ignoramos esos efectos secundarios y suponemos que el agente es la función de utilidad UI se normaliza para que UI: O → [0, 1]. EJEMPLO 1. Hay dos agentes, A y B. El agente A tiene una tarea T que debe realizarse y también 100 unidades de un recurso R. Agente B tiene la capacidad de realizar la Tarea T y desea obtener al menos 10 y como la mayoría de las 20 unidades del recurso R. Agente B esindiferente en cualquier monto entre 10 y 20 unidades del recurso R. Las funciones objetivas para los agentes A y B son los costos y los ingresos. Y ambos apuntan a minimizar los costos mientras maximizan los ingresos. Hacer T se genera para un ingreso RA, T mientras se incurre en un costo CB, T a B. El agente B obtiene un ingreso RB, R para cada unidad del recurso R al tiempo que proporciona cada unidad del recurso R Costos del Agente A CA, r. Suponiendo que la transferencia de dinero entre los agentes es posible, el ATT del conjunto contiene tres atributos: • t, tomando valores del conjunto {0, 1}, indica si la tarea t se asigna al agente B;• R, tomando valores del conjunto de enteros no negativos, indica la cantidad de recursos R que se asigna al Agente B;y • MT, tomando valores de R, indica que el pago P se transferirá de A a B. Considere el resultado o = [t = 1, r = k, mt = p], es decir, la tarea t se asigna a b, y A asigna a b con k unidades del recurso r, y A transfiere póblares a B. Entonces, costa (o) = k.ca, r + p y reva (o) = ra, t;y costb (o) = cb, t y reva (o) = j k.rb, r + p si 10 ≤ k ≤ 20 p de lo contrario. Y, σi (Costi (O), revi (O)) = revi (O) - Costi (O), (I = A, B).3. Formalización del problema Considere el Ejemplo 1, suponga que RA, T = $ 150 y CB, T = $ 100 y RB, R = $ 10 y CA, R = $ 7. Es decir, los ingresos generados para A exceden los costos incurridos en B para hacer la Tarea T, y B valora el recurso R más alto que el costo para que A lo proporcione. La solución óptima a este escenario de problemas es asignar la Tarea T al Agente B y asignar 20 unidades de recursos R (es decir, la cantidad máxima de recursos R requerido por el Agente B) del Agente A al Agente B. Este resultado con respecto a los problemas de asignación de recursos y tareas deja pagos de $ 10 al agente A y $ 100 al agente B.2 Cualquier otro resultado dejaría al menos uno de los agentes peor. En otras palabras, el resultado presentado es pareto eficiente y debe ser parte del resultado de la solución para este escenario de problemas. Sin embargo, como los agentes aún tienen que negociar sobre la cantidad de transferencia de dinero P, ninguno de los agentes estaría dispuesto a revelar sus respectivos costos e ingresos con respecto a la tarea T y el recurso R. Como consecuencia, los agentes a menudo no logran el resultado óptimopresentado anteriormente en la práctica. Para abordar este problema, presentamos a un mediador para ayudar a los agentes a descubrir mejores acuerdos que los que podrían intentar establecerse. Tenga en cuenta que este problema es esencialmente el problema de buscar ganancias conjuntas en una negociación multilateral en la que las partes involucradas tengan información estratégica, es decir, la parte integradora en una negociación. Para ayudar a facilitar este proceso, presentamos el papel de un mediador neutral. Antes de formalizar los problemas de decisión que enfrentan el mediador y el 2 ciertamente, sin transferencia de dinero para compensar al Agente A, este resultado no es justo.Negociando agentes, discutimos las propiedades de los resultados de la solución para ser logrados por el mediador. En un entorno de negociación, los dos objetivos de diseño típicos serían: • Eficiencia: evite que los agentes se decidan por un resultado que no sea pareto optimista;y • Equidad: evite los acuerdos que dan la mayor parte de las ganancias a un subconjunto de agentes mientras dejan el resto con muy poco. Los objetivos anteriores están axiomatizados en el trabajo seminal de Nashs [16] en los juegos de negociación cooperativos. Esencialmente, Nash aboga por las siguientes propiedades que se satisfacen con la solución al problema de negociación bilateral: (i) solo produce resultados óptimos de Pareto;(ii) es invariante a la transformación afina (al espacio de consecuencia);(iii) es simétrico;y (iv) es independiente de alternativas irrelevantes. Una solución que satisface los axiomas de Nashs se llama solución de negociación de NASH. Luego resulta que, al tomar los servicios públicos de los negociadores, como sus objetivos, el mediador mismo enfrenta un problema de toma de decisiones de criterios múltiples. Los problemas que enfrentan el mediador son: (i) El mediador requiere acceso a las funciones de servicios públicos de negociadores, y (ii) hacer compensaciones (justas) entre las utilidades de los diferentes agentes. Nuestros métodos permiten a los agentes interactuar repetidamente con el mediador para que las partes puedan encontrar un resultado de la solución NASH. Informalmente, el problema que enfrenta tanto el mediador como los negociadores es la construcción de las curvas de indiferencia. ¿Por qué son tan importantes las curvas de indiferencia?• Para los negociadores, conocer las opciones disponibles a lo largo de las curvas de indiferencia abre oportunidades para alcanzar resultados más eficientes. Por ejemplo, considere a un agente A que presenta a su oponente una oferta θa que ella se niega a aceptar. En lugar de tener que admitir, un podría mirar su curva de indiferencia que pasa por θa y elegir otra propuesta θa. Para él, θa y θa son indiferentes, pero θa podría dar algunas ganancias a B y, por lo tanto, serán más aceptables para B. En otras palabras, el resultado θa es más eficiente que θa para estos dos negociadores.• Para el mediador, la construcción de curvas de indiferencia requiere una medida de equidad entre los negociadores. El mediador necesita determinar cuánta utilidad debe quitar de los otros negociadores para darle a un negociador particular una ganancia específica (en la utilidad). Para buscar soluciones integradoras dentro del espacio de resultados o, caracterizamos la relación entre los agentes sobre el conjunto de atributos Att. Como los agentes tienen diferentes objetivos y tienen diferentes capacidades, puede ser el caso de que cambiar entre dos valores de un atributo específico implica diferentes cambios en la utilidad de los agentes. Sin embargo, el problema de encontrar el set3 paretooptimal exacto es NP-HARD [2]. Por lo tanto, nuestro enfoque es resolver este problema de optimización en dos pasos. En los primeros pasos, se resolverán los atributos más manejables. Estos son atributos que toman un conjunto finito de valores. El resultado de este paso sería un subconjunto de resultados que contiene el conjunto óptimo de Pareto. En el segundo paso, empleamos un procedimiento iterativo que permite al mediador interactuar con los negociadores para encontrar mejoras conjuntas que se muevan hacia un resultado óptimo de Pareto. Este enfoque no funcionará a menos que los atributos de ATT 3 el conjunto óptimo de Pareto sea el conjunto de resultados cuyas consecuencias (en el espacio de consecuencia) corresponden a la frontera de Pareto.510 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) son independientes. La mayoría de los trabajos en la negociación de múltiples atributos o de múltiples problemas (por ejemplo, [17]) suponen que los atributos o los problemas son independientes, lo que resulta en una función de valor aditivo para cada agente.4 Supongo 1. Sea i ∈ N y S ⊆ Att. Denota por ¯s el conjunto Att \\ S. Suponga que VS y VS son dos asignaciones de valores a los atributos de S y V1 ¯s, V2 ¯s son dos asignaciones de valor arbitrarias a los atributos de ¯s, entonces (ui ([[[[[[[[[[vs, v1 ¯s]) - ui ([vs, v2 ¯s])) = (ui ([vs, v1 ¯s]) - ui ([vs, v2 ¯s])). Es decir, la función de utilidad del agente I se definirá en los atributos de s independientemente de cualquier asignación de valor a otros atributos.4. Las negociaciones bilaterales basadas en mediadores, según lo discutido por Lax y Sebenius [13], bajo información incompleta, la tensión entre crear y reclamar valores es la causa principal de resultados ineficientes. Esto se puede ver más fácilmente en las negociaciones que involucran a dos negociadores;Durante la fase distributiva de la negociación, los dos objetivos de los negociadores se oponen directamente entre sí. Ahora caracterizaremos formalmente esta relación entre los negociadores definiendo la oposición entre dos partes negociantes. La siguiente exposición se reproducirá principalmente de [9]. Asumiendo por el momento que todos los atributos de ATT toman valores del conjunto de números reales r, es decir, v alj ⊆ r para todos j ∈ Att. Además, suponemos que el conjunto O = × j∈Attv Alj de resultados factibles se define mediante restricciones de que todas las partes deben obedecer y o es convexa. Ahora, un resultado o ∈ O es solo un punto en el espacio m-dimensional de números reales. Entonces, las preguntas son: (i) Desde el punto de vista de un agente I, ¿ya es el mejor resultado para I?(ii) Si O no es el mejor resultado para I ¿Existe otro resultado O tal que o le da a I una mejor utilidad que O y O no causa una pérdida de utilidad al otro agente J en comparación con O? Las preguntas anteriores se pueden responder observando las instrucciones de mejora de las partes negociantes en O, es decir, las instrucciones en el espacio de resultados O en el que aumentan sus utilidades en el punto o. Bajo el supuesto de que las funciones de utilidad de las partes son cóncavas diferenciables, el conjunto de todas las direcciones de mejora para una parte en un punto O puede definirse en términos de su dirección más preferida o gradiente en ese punto. Cuando la dirección de gradiente ∇ui (o) del agente I en el punto o se opone directamente a la dirección de gradiente ∇uj (o) del agente j en el punto o, entonces las dos partes no están de acuerdo en O y no se pueden lograr mejoras conjuntas para iy J en la localidad que rodea o. Dado que la oposición entre las dos partes puede variar considerablemente sobre el espacio de resultados (con un par de resultados considerados altamente antagónicos y otro par siendo altamente cooperativo), necesitamos describir las propiedades locales de la relación. Comenzamos con la oposición en cualquier momento del espacio de resultados RM. La siguiente definición se reproduce de [9]: Definición 2. 1. Las partes están en oposición estricta local en un punto x ∈ Rm Iff para todos los puntos x ∈ Rm que están suficientemente cerca de X (es decir, para algunos> 0 tal que ∀x x −x <), se puede lograr un aumento de una utilidadsolo a expensas de una disminución de la otra utilidad.2. Las partes están en la oposición local no estricta en un punto x ∈ RM IFF, no están en oposición estricta local en X, es decir, IFF es posible que ambas partes eleven sus utilidades moviendo una distancia infinitesimal de X.4 Klein et al.[10] exploran varias implicaciones de contratos complejos en los que los atributos son posiblemente interdependientes.3. Las partes están en la oposición débil local en un punto x ∈ Rm Iff ∇u1 (x) .∇u2 (x) ≥ 0, es decir, los gradientes en x de las dos funciones de utilidad forman un ángulo agudo o recto.4. Las partes están en la oposición local fuerte en un punto x ∈ Rm Iff ∇u1 (x) .∇u2 (x) <0, es decir, si los gradientes en x forman un ángulo obtuso.5. Las partes están en oposición global estricta (no constricta, débil, fuerte) IFF por cada x ∈ Rm que están en oposición local (no constricto, débil, fuerte). Las oposiciones globales estrictas y no constrictas son casos complementarios. Esencialmente, bajo la oposición estricta global, todo el espacio de resultados o se convierte en el conjunto óptimo de Pareto, ya que en ningún momento las partes negociantes pueden hacer una mejora conjunta, es decir, cada punto en O es un resultado de pareto eficiente. En otras palabras, bajo la oposición estricta global, el espacio de resultados o puede aplanarse en una sola línea de tal manera que para cada par de resultados x, y ∈ O, u1 (x) <u1 (y) iff u2 (x)> u2 (y), es decir, en cada punto de o, el gradiente de las dos funciones de utilidad apunta a dos extremos diferentes de la línea. Intuitivamente, la oposición estricta global implica que no hay forma de obtener mejoras conjuntas para ambos agentes. Como consecuencia, la negociación degenera a una negociación distributiva, es decir, las partes negociantes deben tratar de reclamar la mayor cantidad de acciones posible de los problemas de negociación, mientras que el mediador debe apuntar a la equidad de la división. Por otro lado, la oposición global no constricta permite espacio para mejoras conjuntas y todas las partes podrían ser mejor tratando de obtener las ganancias potenciales al alcanzar los acuerdos de Paretoeficientes. Las oposiciones débiles y fuertes indican diferentes niveles de oposición. Cuanto más débil sea la oposición, más ganancias potenciales se pueden lograr haciendo que la cooperación sea la mejor estrategia para emplear durante la negociación. Por otro lado, la oposición más fuerte sugiere que los partidos negociadores tienden a comportarse estratégicamente, lo que lleva a la tergiversación de sus respectivos objetivos y funciones de utilidad y que hacen que las ganancias conjuntas sean más difíciles de realizar. Hemos estado suponiendo temporalmente de que el espacio de resultados O es el subconjunto de RM. En muchas negociaciones del mundo real, esta suposición sería demasiado restrictiva. Continuaremos nuestra exposición levantando esta restricción y permitiendo atributos discretos. Sin embargo, como la mayoría de las negociaciones implican solo problemas discretos con un número limitado de opciones, asumiremos que cada atributo toma valores de un conjunto finito o del conjunto de números reales R. En el resto del documento, nos referiremos a los atributoscuyos valores son de conjuntos finitos como atributos y atributos simples cuyos valores son de R como atributos continuos. Las nociones de oposiciones locales, es decir, estrictas, no constrictas, débiles y fuertes, no son aplicables a los espacios de resultado que contienen atributos simples y tampoco son las nociones de oposiciones globales débiles y fuertes. Sin embargo, las nociones de oposiciones globales estrictas y no constrictas pueden generalizarse para espacios de resultado que contienen atributos simples. Definición 3. Dado un espacio de resultados o, las partes están en oposición estricta global Iff ∀x, y ∈ O, u1 (x) <u1 (y) iff u2 (x)> u2 (y). Las partes están en la oposición global de no constricto si no están en una oposición estricta global.4.1 Optimización en atributos simples Para extraer los valores óptimos para un subconjunto de atributos, en el primer paso de este proceso de optimización, el mediador solicita a los negociadores que presenten sus respectivas funciones de utilidad sobre el conjunto de atributos simples. Deje que Simp ⊆ ATT denote el conjunto de todos los atributos simples de ATT. Tenga en cuenta que, debido a la Asunción 1, el agente es el sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 511 La función de utilidad se puede caracterizar de la siguiente manera: ui ([vSimp, vSimp]) = wi 1 ∗ ui, 1 ([vSimp]) + wi 2 ∗ ui, 2 ([[[[vSimp]), donde SIMP = ATT \\ SIMP, y UI, 1 y UI, 2 son los componentes de utilidad de UI sobre los conjuntos de atributos SIMP y SIMP, respectivamente, y 0 <wi 1, wi 2 <1 y wi 1 +Wi 2 = 1. Como los atributos son independientes entre sí con respecto a las funciones de utilidad de los agentes, el problema de optimización sobre los atributos de SIMP puede llevarse a cabo fijando UI ([VSIMP]) a una C constante, y luego buscar los valores óptimos dentro del conjunto de atributosBobo. Ahora, ¿cómo determina el mediador los valores óptimos para los atributos en SIMP? Aquí podrían aplicarse varias estrategias de optimización bien conocidas: • La solución utilitaria: la suma de los servicios públicos de los agentes se maximiza. Por lo tanto, los valores óptimos son la solución del siguiente problema de optimización: arg max v∈V alsimp x i∈N ui (v) • La solución NASH: el producto de los servicios públicos de los agentes se maximiza. Por lo tanto, los valores óptimos son la solución del siguiente problema de optimización: arg max v∈V alsimp y i∈N ui (v) • La solución igualitaria (también conocida como la solución maximin): la utilidad del agente con utilidad mínima se maximiza. Por lo tanto, los valores óptimos son la solución del siguiente problema de optimización: arg max v∈V alsimp min i∈N ui (v) La pregunta ahora es, por supuesto, si un negociador tiene el incentivo de tergiversar su función de utilidad. En primer lugar, recuerde que las funciones de utilidad de los agentes están limitadas, es decir, ∀o ∈ O.0 ≤ ui (o) ≤ 1. Por lo tanto, los agentes no tienen ningún incentivo para exagerar su utilidad con respecto a un resultado o: si o es el resultado más preferido para un agente, entonces él ya asigna la utilidad máxima a o. Por otro lado, si O no es el resultado más preferido para que yo sea exagerando la utilidad que asigna a O, el agente que corre el riesgo de tener que resolver un acuerdo que le daría menos recompensas de los que se supone que debe recibir. Sin embargo, los agentes tienen un incentivo para subestimar su utilidad si el acuerdo final se basará solo en las soluciones anteriores. Esencialmente, el mecanismo para evitar que un agente subestima su utilidad con respecto a los resultados particulares es garantizar una cierta medida de equidad para el acuerdo final. Es decir, los agentes pierden el incentivo para ser deshonestos para obtener ganancias al aprovechar las soluciones conocidas para determinar el resultado del asentamiento, ya que se compensarían con el mecanismo de mantenimiento de la equidad. Primeros, declaramos un lema fácil. Lema 1. Cuando SIMP contiene un solo atributos, los agentes tienen el incentivo de subestimar sus funciones de utilidad con respecto a los resultados que no son atractivos para ellos. A modo de ilustración, considere el conjunto SIMP que contiene solo un atributo que podría tomar valores del conjunto finito {A, B, C, D}. Suponga que el negociador 1 asigna servicios públicos de 0.4, 0.7, 0.9 y 1 a A, B, C y D, respectivamente. Suponga también que el negociador 2 asigna utilidades de 1, 0.9, 0.7 y 0.4 a A, B, C y D, respectivamente. Si el agente 1 tergiversa su función de utilidad al mediador al informar la utilidad 0 para todos los valores A, B y C y la utilidad 1 para el valor D, entonces el agente 2 que juega honestamente en su informe al mediador obtendrá el peor resultado d dado cualquiera delas soluciones anteriores. Tenga en cuenta que el Agente 1 no necesita conocer la función de utilidad del Agente 2, ni necesita conocer la estrategia empleada por el Agente 2. Mientras sepa que el mediador empleará una de las tres soluciones anteriores, entonces la tergiversación anterior es la estrategia dominante para este juego. Sin embargo, cuando el set SIMP contiene más de un atributo y ninguno de los atributos dominan fuertemente los otros atributos, el problema anterior supera por sí mismo gracias a la solución integradora. Por supuesto, tenemos que definir claramente lo que significa para un atributo para dominar fuertemente otros atributos. Intuitivamente, si la mayoría de los agentes se concentra en uno de los atributos, este atributo domina fuertemente otros atributos. Nuevamente apelamos a la Asunción 1 sobre la aditividad de las funciones de servicios públicos para lograr una medida de equidad dentro de este entorno de negociación. Debido a la Asunción 1, podemos caracterizar el agente es un componente de utilidad sobre el conjunto de atributos SIMP por la siguiente ecuación: ui, 1 ([vSimp]) = x j∈Simp wi j ∗ ui, j ([vj]) (1)donde p j∈Simp wj = 1. Luego, un atributo ∈ SIMP domina fuertemente el resto de los atributos en SIMP (para el agente I) Iff wi> p j∈ (Simp−) wi j. Se dice que el atributo es fuertemente dominante (para el agente I) WRT.El conjunto de atributos simples SIMP. El siguiente teorema muestra que si el conjunto de atributos SIMP no contiene un atributo fuertemente dominante, los negociadores no tienen incentivos para ser deshonestos. Teorema 1. Dado un marco de negociación, si para cada agente el conjunto de atributos simples no contiene un atributo fuertemente dominante, entonces la verdad es una estrategia de equilibrio para los negociadores durante la optimización de atributos simples. Hasta ahora, nos hemos estado concentrando en el problema de la eficiencia mientras dejamos de lado el problema de la equidad. Un marco justo no solo respalda una distribución más satisfactoria de la utilidad entre los agentes, sino que también a menudo es una buena medida para evitar la tergiversación de la información privada por parte de los agentes. De las tres soluciones presentadas anteriormente, la solución utilitaria no respalda la equidad. Por otro lado, Nash [16] prueba que la solución NASH satisface los cuatro axiomas anteriores para los Juegos de Negociación Cooperativa y se considera una solución justa. La solución igualitaria es otro mecanismo para lograr la equidad al ayudar esencialmente a lo peor. El problema con estas soluciones, como se discutió anteriormente, es que son vulnerables a los comportamientos estratégicos cuando uno de los atributos domina fuertemente el resto de los atributos. Sin embargo, hay otra solución que tiene como objetivo garantizar la equidad, la solución Minimax. Es decir, se minimiza la utilidad del agente con máxima utilidad. Es obvio que la solución Minimax produce resultados ineficientes. Sin embargo, para evitar este problema (dado que el conjunto óptimo de Pareto se puede calcular tractablemente), podemos aplicar esta solución solo sobre el conjunto óptimo de Pareto. Deje que POSET ⊆ V alsimp que sea el subconjunto óptimo de Pareto de los resultados simples, la solución Minax se define como la solución del siguiente problema de optimización.arg min v∈P oset max i∈N ui (v) Si bien la eficiencia general a menudo se sufre bajo una solución minimax, es decir, la suma de todos los servicios de los agentes a menudo es más baja que en otras soluciones, se puede demostrar que la solución Minimax es menosvulnerable a la manipulación.512 El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) Teorema 2. Dado un marco de negociación, bajo la solución Minimax, si los negociadores no están seguros sobre las preferencias de sus oponentes, entonces la tinción de la verdad es una estrategia de equilibrio para los negociadores durante la optimización de atributos simples. Es decir, incluso cuando solo hay un solo atributo simple, si un agente no está seguro de si los otros agentes más preferidos la resolución es también su propia resolución más preferida, entonces debe optar por la verdad como la estrategia óptima.4.2 Optimización en atributos continuos Cuando los atributos toman valores de conjuntos infinitos, suponemos que son continuos. Esto es similar a la práctica común en la investigación de operaciones en la que las soluciones/técnicas de programación lineal se aplican a los problemas de programación de enteros. Denotamos el número de atributos continuos por K, es decir, ATT = SIMP ∪ SIMP y | SIMP |= k.Entonces, el espacio de resultado O se puede representar de la siguiente manera: o = (q j∈Simp v alj) × (q l∈Simp v All), donde q l∈Simp v All ⊆ rk es el componente continuo de O. Deje que OC denote el conjunto q l∈Simp v All. Bien consulte OC como el conjunto factible y suponga que OC está cerrado y convexo. Después de llevar a cabo la optimización sobre el conjunto de atributos simples, podemos asignar los valores óptimos a los atributos simples de SIMP. Por lo tanto, reducimos el problema original al problema de buscar resultados óptimos (y justos) dentro del conjunto factible OC. Recuerde que, por la suposición 1, podemos caracterizar el agente es la función de utilidad de la siguiente manera: ui ([v ∗ simp, vSimp]) = c + wi 2 ∗ ui, 2 ([vSimp]), donde c es la constante wi 1 ∗UI, 1 ([V ∗ SIMP]) y V ∗ SIMP denota los valores óptimos de los atributos simples en SIMP. Por lo tanto, sin pérdida de generalidad (aunque con un abuso descarado de notación), podemos tomar el agente es la función de utilidad como UI: RK → [0, 1]. En consecuencia, también tomaremos el conjunto de resultados bajo consideración por parte de los agentes como el conjunto factible OC. Ahora establecemos otra suposición que se utilizará en esta sección: Asunción 2. Las funciones de utilidad de los negociadores se pueden describir mediante funciones continuamente diferenciables y cóncavas UI: RK → [0, 1], (i = 1, 2). Debe enfatizarse que no asumimos que los agentes conocen explícitamente sus funciones de utilidad. Para que el método se describirá a continuación para trabajar, solo suponemos que los agentes conocen la información relevante, p.En cierto punto dentro del conjunto factible OC, la dirección de gradiente de sus propias funciones de utilidad y alguna sección de sus respectivas curvas de indiferencia. Suponga que un acuerdo tentativo (que es un punto x ∈ RK) está actualmente en la tabla, el proceso para que los agentes mejoren conjuntamente este acuerdo para llegar a un acuerdo óptimo de Pareto se puede describir de la siguiente manera. El mediador pide a los negociadores que presenten discretamente sus respectivas instrucciones de gradiente en X, es decir, ∇u1 (x) y ∇u2 (x). Tenga en cuenta que el objetivo del proceso que se describirá aquí es buscar acuerdos que sean más eficientes que el acuerdo tentativo actualmente sobre la tabla. Es decir, estamos buscando puntos X dentro del conjunto de OC factible de modo que moverse a X desde el Acuerdo tentativo actual X trae más ganancias a al menos uno de los agentes sin dañar a ninguno de los agentes. Debido a la suposición hecha anteriormente, es decir, el conjunto de OC factible está limitado, las condiciones para una alternativa x ∈ OC para ser eficientes varían según la posición de x. Los siguientes resultados se prueban en [9]: Sea B (x) = 0 denota la ecuación del límite de OC, definiendo x ∈ OC IFF B (X) ≥ 0. Una alternativa x ∗ ∈ OC es eficiente IFF, ya sea A. x ∗ está en el interior de OC y las partes están en oposición local estricta en x ∗, es decir, ∇u1 (x ∗) = −γ∇u2 (x ∗)(2) donde γ> 0;o B. x ∗ está en el límite de OC, y para algunos α, β ≥ 0: α∇u1 (x ∗) + β∇u2 (x ∗) = ∇b (x ∗) (3) Ahora estamos interesadosAl responder las siguientes preguntas: (i) ¿Cuál es el acuerdo tentativo inicial x0?(ii) ¿Cómo encontrar el acuerdo más eficiente XH+1, dado el acuerdo tentativo actual XH?4.2.1 Determinación de un acuerdo tentativo inicial justo debe enfatizarse que la elección del acuerdo tentativo inicial afecta la equidad del acuerdo final a alcanzar el método presentado. Por ejemplo, si el Acuerdo tentativo inicial X0 se elige para ser la alternativa más preferida a uno de los agentes, entonces también es un resultado óptimo de Pareto, lo que hace que sea imposible encontrar cualquier mejora conjunta de x0. Sin embargo, si se eligirá X0 para ser el acuerdo final y si X0 resulta ser la peor alternativa al otro agente, entonces este resultado es muy injusto. Por lo tanto, es importante que la elección del acuerdo tentativo inicial se haga sensiblemente. Ehtamo et al [3] presentan varios métodos para elegir el acuerdo tentativo inicial (llamado punto de referencia en su documento). Sin embargo, su objetivo es aproximar el conjunto óptimo de Pareto optando sistemáticamente un conjunto de puntos de referencia. Una vez que se genera un conjunto (aproximado) Pareto-Optimal, se deja a los negociadores decidir cuál de los resultados óptimos de Pareto generados se eligirá como el acuerdo final. Es decir, la negociación distributiva será requerida para resolver el problema. Nosotros, por otro lado, estamos interesados en un acuerdo tentativo inicial justo que no es necesariamente eficiente. La mejora de un acuerdo tentativo dado para producir un acuerdo óptimo de Pareto se considera en la siguiente sección. Para cada atributo j ∈ Simpl, un agente. Se le pedirá que envíe discretamente tres valores (del conjunto v alj): el valor más preferido, denotado por PVI, J, el valor menos preferido, denotado por WVI, J y Avalor que me da un recompensa aproximadamente promedio, denotado por AVI, j.(Tenga en cuenta que esto es posible porque el conjunto v Alj está limitado). Si Pv1, J y Pv2, J están suficientemente cerca, es decir, | Pv1, J - Pv2, J |<Δ Para algunos δ> 0 predefinidos, entonces PV1, J y Pv2, J se eligen para ser los dos valores centrales, denotados por CV1 y CV2. De lo contrario, entre los dos valores PV1, J y AV1, J, eliminamos el que está más cerca de WV2, J, el valor restante se denota por CV1. Del mismo modo, obtenemos CV2 de los dos valores PV2, J y AV2, J. Si CV1 = CV2, CV1 se selecciona como el valor inicial para el atributo J como parte del acuerdo tentativo inicial. De lo contrario, sin pérdida de generalidad, suponemos que CV1 <CV2. El mediador selecciona los valores p aleatorios MV1 ,..., MVP desde el intervalo abierto (CV1, CV2), donde P ≥ 1. Luego, el mediador le pide a los agentes que envíen sus valoraciones sobre el conjunto de valores {CV1, CV2, MV1 ,..., MVP}. El valor cuyas dos valoraciones de dos agentes están más cercanos se selecciona como el valor inicial para el atributo j como parte del acuerdo tentativo inicial. El procedimiento anterior garantiza que los agentes no ganen al comportarse estratégicamente. Al realizar el procedimiento anterior en cada atributo j ∈ SIMP, podemos identificar el acuerdo tentativo inicial x0 tal que x0 ∈ OC. El siguiente paso es calcular un nuevo acuerdo tentativo de un acuerdo tentativo existente para que el nuevo sea más eficiente que el existente. El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 513 4.2.2 Computación de un nuevo acuerdo tentativo, nuestro procedimiento es una combinación del método para mejorar conjuntamente la dirección introducida por Ehtamo et al [4] y un método que proponemos en la sección próxima. Básicamente, la idea es ver cuán fuerte se encuentran la oposición en las partes. Si las dos partes están en una oposición (local) débil en el acuerdo tentativo actual XH, es decir, sus direcciones de mejora en XH están cerca unas de la otra, entonces la dirección de compromiso propuesta por Ehtamo et al [4] es probable que apunte a un mejoracuerdo para ambos agentes. Sin embargo, si las dos partes están en una fuerte oposición local en el punto actual XH, entonces no está claro si la dirección del compromiso realmente no perjudicaría a uno de los agentes mientras le brindan algún beneficio al otro. Primero revisaremos el método propuesto por Ehtamo et al [4] para calcular la dirección de compromiso para un grupo de negociadores en un punto dado x ∈ OC. Ehtamo et al definen una función t (x) que describe la elección de los mediadores para una dirección de compromiso en x. Para el caso de las negociaciones bipartidistas, la siguiente función de bisectante, denotada por T BS, se puede definir sobre el conjunto interior de OC. Tenga en cuenta que el conjunto cerrado OC contiene dos subconjuntos disjuntos: OC = OC 0 ∪OC B, donde OC 0 denota el conjunto de puntos interiores de OC y OC B denota el límite de OC. El compromiso de bisectante se define mediante una función T BS: OC 0 → R2, T BS (x) = ∇U1 (x) ∇u1 (x) + ∇u2 (x) ∇u2 (x), x ∈ Oc 0. ((4) Dado el acuerdo tentativo actual XH (h ≥ 0), el mediador debe elegir un punto XH+1 a lo largo de d = t (xh) para que todas las partes ganen. Ehtamo et al luego definen un mecanismo para generar una secuencia de puntos y demuestran que cuando la secuencia generada está limitada y cuando todos los puntos generados (de la secuencia) pertenecen al conjunto interior OC 0, entonces la secuencia converge a un acuerdo débilmente paretooptimal [4, pp. 59-60] .5 Como el mecanismo anterior no funciona en los puntos límite de OC, presentaremos un procedimiento que funcione en todas partes en un espacio alternativo OC. Deje x ∈ OC y θ (x) denota el ángulo entre los gradientes ∇u1 (x) y ∇u2 (x) en x. Es decir, θ (x) = arccos (∇u1 (x) .∇u2 (x) ∇u1 (x). ∇u2 (x)) De la definición 2, es obvio que las dos partes están en oposición estricta local (en x) iff θ (x) = π, y están en la oposición local fuerte IFF π ≥ θ (x)> π/2, y están en oposición débil local IFF π/2 ≥ θ (x) ≥ 0. Tenga en cuenta también que los dos vectores ∇u1 (x) y ∇u2 (x) definen un hiperplano, denotado por H∇ (x), en el espacio kdimensional RK. Además, hay dos curvas de indiferencia de los agentes 1 y 2 pasando por el punto X, denotado por IC1 (x) e IC2 (x), respectivamente. Deje que Ht1 (x) y Ht2 (x) denoten los hiperplanos tangentes a las curvas de indiferencia IC1 (x) e IC2 (x), respectivamente, en el punto x. Los planos HT1 (X) y HT2 (X) se cruzan H∇ (x) en las líneas IS1 (x) e IS2 (x), respectivamente. Tenga en cuenta que dada una línea l (x) que pasa por el punto x, hay dos vectores (unitarios) de x a lo largo de L (x) apuntando a dos direcciones opuestas, denotadas por L+ (x) y L− (x). Ahora podemos explicar informalmente nuestra solución al problema de buscar ganancias articulares. Cuando no es posible obtener una dirección de compromiso para las mejoras conjuntas en un punto x ∈ OC, ya sea porque el vector de compromiso apunta al espacio fuera del conjunto factible OC o porque las dos partes están en oposición local fuerte en X, consideraremos aMueva a lo largo de la curva de indiferencia de una parte mientras intenta mejorar la utilidad de la otra parte. Como 5 es el conjunto de alternativas, x ∗ es débilmente pareto óptimo si no hay x ∈ S tal que ui (x)> ui (x ∗) para todos los agentes i.El mediador no conoce las curvas de indiferencia de las partes, tiene que usar los hiperplanos tangentes para las curvas de indiferencia de las partes en el punto x. Tenga en cuenta que el hiperplano tangente a una curva es una aproximación útil de la curva en las inmediaciones del punto de tangencia, x. Ahora estamos describiendo un paso de iteración para alcanzar el siguiente acuerdo tentativo XH+1 del acuerdo tentativo actual xh ∈ OC. Se dice que un vector V cuya cola es XH está limitada en OC si ∃λ> 0 tal que xh +λv ∈ OC. Para comenzar, el mediador pregunta a los negociadores por sus gradientes ∇U1 (XH) y ∇U2 (XH), respectivamente, en XH.1. Si XH es un resultado óptimo de Pareto de acuerdo con la Ecuación 2 o la Ecuación 3, entonces el proceso termina.2. Si 1 ≥ ∇u1 (xh) .∇u2 (xh)> 0 y el vector t bs (xh) está limitado en OC, entonces el mediador elige el compromiso que mejora la dirección d = t bs (xh) y aplica el método descrito por ehtamoet al [4] para generar el siguiente acuerdo tentativo XH+1.3. De lo contrario, entre los cuatro vectores ISσ I (xh), i = 1, 2 y σ = +/−, el mediador elige el vector que (i) está limitado en OC, y (ii) está más cerca del gradiente de la otraAgente, ∇uj (xh) (j = i). Denota este vector por T G (XH). Es decir, buscaremos un punto en la curva de indiferencia del Agente I, ICI (XH), mientras intentamos mejorar la utilidad del Agente J. Tenga en cuenta que cuando XH es un punto interior de OC, entonces la situación es simétrica para los dos agentes 1 y 2, y el mediador tiene la opción de encontrar un punto en IC1 (XH) para mejorar la utilidad del Agente 2, o encontrar unSeñale en IC2 (XH) para mejorar la utilidad del agente 1. Para decidir qué opción hacer, el mediador tiene que calcular la distribución de ganancias durante todo el proceso para evitar dar más ganancias a un agente que al otro. Ahora, el punto XH+1 que se generará se encuentra en algún lugar de la intersección de ICI (XH) y el hiperplano definido por ∇ui (XH) y T G (XH). Esta intersección es aproximada por T G (XH). Por lo tanto, el punto solicitado XH+1 puede generarse primero encontrando un punto yh a lo largo de la dirección de T G (XH) y luego moverse de YH a la misma dirección de ∇ui (XH) hasta que nos cruzamos con ICI (XH). Matemáticamente, que ζ y ξ denoten los vectores T G (XH) y ∇UI (XH), respectivamente, XH + 1 es la solución al siguiente problema de optimización: Max λ1, λ2∈L UJ (XH + λ1ζ + λ2ξ) S.T.xh+λ1ζ+λ2ξ ∈ Oc, y ui (xh+λ1ζ+λ2ξ va) = ui (xh), donde l es un intervalo adecuado de números reales positivos;por ejemplo, l = {λ | λ> 0}, o l = {λ | a <λ ≤ b}, 0 ≤ a <b. Dado un acuerdo tentativo inicial x0, el método descrito anteriormente permite una secuencia de acuerdos tentativos x1, x2 ,...para ser iterativamente generado. La iteración se detiene cada vez que se llega a un acuerdo óptimo débilmente Pareto. Teorema 3. Si la secuencia de acuerdos generados por el método anterior está limitado, el método converge a un punto x ∗ ∈ OC que es débilmente pareto óptimo.5. Conclusión y trabajo futuro En este documento hemos establecido un marco para la negociación que se basa en la teoría de MCDM para representar los objetivos y los servicios públicos de los agentes. El enfoque del documento está en la negociación integradora en la que los agentes apuntan a maximizar las ganancias conjuntas o crear valor.514 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07), hemos introducido un mediador en la negociación para permitir a los negociadores divulgar información sobre sus servicios públicos, sin proporcionar esta información a sus oponentes. Además, el mediador también trabaja hacia el objetivo de lograr la equidad del resultado de la negociación. Es decir, el enfoque que describimos tiene como objetivo ambas eficiencia, en el sentido de que produce resultados óptimos de Pareto (es decir, ningún aspecto puede mejorarse para una de las partes sin empeorar el resultado para otra parte), y también para la equidad, que eligeSoluciones óptimas que distribuyen ganancias entre los agentes de alguna manera apropiada. Hemos desarrollado un proceso de dos pasos para abordar el problema NP-Hard de encontrar una solución para un conjunto de atributos integradores, que está dentro del conjunto óptimo de Pareto para esos atributos. Para atributos simples (es decir, aquellos que tienen un conjunto finito de valores) utilizamos técnicas de optimización conocidas para encontrar una solución paretooptimal. Para disuadir a los agentes de tergiversar sus utilidades para obtener una ventaja, buscamos soluciones menos vulnerables a la manipulación. Hemos demostrado que mientras uno de los atributos simples no domine fuertemente a los demás, entonces la verdadera que contar es una estrategia de equilibrio para los negociadores durante la etapa de optimización de atributos simples. Para los atributos no simples, proponemos un mecanismo que proporciona mejoras graduales para mover la solución propuesta en la dirección de una solución paretooptimal. El enfoque presentado en este documento es similar a las ideas detrás del análisis de negociación [18]. Ehtamo et al [4] presenta un enfoque para buscar ganancias conjuntas en negociaciones multipartidistas. La relación de su enfoque con nuestro enfoque se discute en la sección anterior. Lai et al [12] proporcionan un enfoque alternativo para la negociación integradora. Si bien su enfoque se describió claramente para el caso de negociaciones de dos problemas, la generalización a las negociaciones con más de dos problemas no está del todo claro. Zhang et [22] discuten el uso de la negociación integradora en las organizaciones de agentes. Asumen que los agentes son honestos. Su principal resultado es un experimento que muestra que en algunas situaciones, la cooperatividad de los agentes puede no aportar los más beneficios a la organización en su conjunto, sin darle a no explicación. Jonker et al [7] consideran un enfoque para la negociación de atributos múltiples sin el uso de un mediador. Por lo tanto, su enfoque puede considerarse un complemento nuestro. Sus resultados experimentales muestran que los agentes pueden alcanzar los resultados paretooptimos utilizando su enfoque. Los detalles del enfoque se han mostrado actualmente solo para la negociación bilateral, y aunque creemos que son generalizables para múltiples negociadores, este trabajo queda por hacer. También hay un trabajo futuro por hacer para caracterizar más completamente los resultados de la determinación de valores para los atributos no simples. Para proporcionar un marco completo, también estamos trabajando en la fase distributiva utilizando el mediador.

        "Joint improvements that bring benefits to all parties can be realised by (i) identifying attributes that are not of direct conflict between the parties, (ii) tradeoffs on attributes that are valued differently by different parties, and (iii) searching for values within attributes that could bring more gains to one party while not incurring too much loss on the other party.",
        "In this paper we propose an approach for maximising joint gains in automated negotiations by formulating the negotiation problem as a multi-criteria decision making problem and taking advantage of several optimisation techniques introduced by operations researchers and conflict theorists.",
        "We use a mediator to protect the negotiating parties from unnecessary disclosure of information to their opponent, while also allowing an objective calculation of maximum joint gains.",
        "We separate out attributes that take a finite set of values (simple attributes) from those with continuous values, and we show that for simple attributes, the mediator can determine the Pareto-optimal values.",
        "In addition we show that if none of the simple attributes strongly dominates the other simple attributes, then truth telling is an equilibrium strategy for negotiators during the optimisation of simple attributes.",
        "We also describe an approach for improving joint gains on non-simple attributes, by moving the parties in a series of steps, towards the Pareto-optimal frontier.",

        "According to conflict theorists Lax and Sebenius [13], most negotiation actually involves both integrative and distributive bargaining which they refer to as creating value and claiming value.",
        "They argue that negotiation necessarily includes both cooperative and competitive elements, and that these elements exist in tension.",
        "Negotiators face a dilemma in deciding whether to pursue a cooperative or a competitive strategy at a particular time during a negotiation.",
        "They refer to this problem as the Negotiators Dilemma.",
        "We argue that the Negotiators Dilemma is essentially informationbased, due to the private information held by the agents.",
        "Such private information contains both the information that implies the agents bottom lines (or, her walk-away positions) and the information that enforces her bargaining strength.",
        "For instance, when bargaining to sell a house to a potential buyer, the seller would try to hide her actual reserve price as much as possible for she hopes to reach an agreement at a much higher price than her reserve price.",
        "On the other hand, the outside options available to her (e.g. other buyers who have expressed genuine interest with fairly good offers) consist in the information that improves her bargaining strength about which she would like to convey to her opponent.",
        "But at the same time, her opponent is well aware of the fact that it is her incentive to boost her bargaining strength and thus will not accept every information she sends out unless it is substantiated by evidence.",
        "Coming back to the Negotiators Dilemma, its not always possible to separate the integrative bargaining process from the distributive bargaining process.",
        "In fact, more often than not, the two processes interplay with each other making information manipulation become part of the integrative bargaining process.",
        "This is because a negotiator could use the information about his opponents interests against her during the distributive negotiation process.",
        "That is, a negotiator may refuse to concede on an important conflicting issue by claiming that he has made a major concession (on another issue) to meet his opponents interests even though the concession he made could be insignificant to him.",
        "For instance, few buyers would start a bargaining with a dealer over a deal for a notebook computer by declaring that he is most interested in an extended warranty for the item and therefore prepared to pay a high price to get such an extended warranty.",

        "However, because of the Negotiators Dilemma and given even bargaining power and incomplete information, the following two undesirable situations often arise: (i) negotiators reach inefficient compromises, or (ii) negotiators engage in a deadlock situation in which both negotiators refuse to act upon with incomplete information and at the same time do not want to disclose more information.",
        "In this paper, we argue for the role of a mediator to resolve the above two issues.",
        "The mediator thus plays two roles in a negotiation: (i) to encourage cooperative behaviour among the negotiators, and (ii) to absorb the information disclosure by the negotiators to prevent negotiators from using uncertainty and private information as a strategic device.",
        "To take advantage of existing results in negotiation analysis and operations research (OR) literatures [18], we employ multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) theory to allow the negotiation problem to be represented and analysed.",
        "Section 2 provides background on MCDM theory and the negotiation framework.",
        "Section 3 formulates the problem.",
        "In Section 4, we discuss our approach to integrative negotiation.",
        "Section 5 discusses the future work with some concluding remarks. 2.",
        "BACKGROUND 2.1 Multi-criteria decision making theory Let A denote the set of feasible alternatives available to a decision maker M. As an act, or decision, a in A may involve multiple aspects, we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of attributes j; (j = 1, . . . , m). (Attributes are also referred to as issues, or decision variables.)",
        "A typical decision maker also has several objectives X1, . . . , Xk.",
        "We assume that Xi, (i = 1, . . . , k), maps the alternatives to real numbers.",
        "Thus, a tuple (x1, . . . , xk) = (X1(a), . . . , Xk(a)) denotes the consequence of the act a to the decision maker M. By definition, objectives are statements that delineate the desires of a decision maker.",
        "Thus, M wishes to maximise his objectives.",
        "However, as discussed thoroughly by Keeney and Raiffa [8], it is quite likely that a decision makers objectives will conflict with each other in that the improved achievement with one objective can only be accomplished at the expense of another.",
        "For instance, most businesses and public services have objectives like minimise cost and maximise the quality of services.",
        "Since better services can often only be attained for a price, these objectives conflict.",
        "Due to the conflicting nature of a decision makers objectives, M usually has to settle at a compromise solution.",
        "That is, he may have to choose an act a ∈ A that does not optimise every objective.",
        "This is the topic of the multi-criteria decision making theory.",
        "Part of the solution to this problem is that M has to try to identify the Pareto frontier in the consequence space {(X1(a), . . . , Xk(a))}a∈A.",
        "DEFINITION 1. (Dominant) Let x = (x1, . . . , xk) and x = (x1, . . . , xk) be two consequences. x dominates x iff xi > xi for all i, and the inequality is strict for at least one i.",
        "The Pareto frontier in a consequence space then consists of all consequences that are not dominated by any other consequence.",
        "This is illustrated in Fig. 1 in which an alternative consists of two attributes d1 and d2 and the decision maker tries to maximise the two objectives X1 and X2.",
        "A decision a ∈ A whose consequence does not lie on the Pareto frontier is inefficient.",
        "While the Pareto 1x d2 a (X (a),X (a)) d1 1 x2 2 Alternative spaceA Pareto frontier Consequence space optimal consequenc Figure 1: The Pareto frontier frontier allows M to avoid taking inefficient decisions, M still has to decide which of the efficient consequences on the Pareto frontier is most preferred by him.",
        "MCDM theorists introduce a mechanism to allow the objective components of consequences to be normalised to the payoff valuations for the objectives.",
        "Consequences can then be ordered: if the gains in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2) equals to the losses in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2), then the two consequences C1 and C2 are considered indifferent.",
        "M can now construct the set of indifference curves1 in the consequence space (the dashed curves in Fig. 1).",
        "The most preferred indifference curve that intersects with the Pareto frontier is in focus: its intersection with the Pareto frontier is the sought after consequence (i.e., the optimal consequence in Fig. 1). 2.2 A negotiation framework A multi-agent negotiation framework consists of: 1.",

        "A set of alternative outcomes O.",
        "An outcome o ∈ O is represented by an assignment of values to the corresponding attributes in Att. 4.",
        "Agents utility: Based on the theory of multiple-criteria decision making [8], we define the agents utility as follows: • Objectives: Agent i has a set of ni objectives, or interests; denoted by j (j = 1, . . . , ni).",
        "To measure how much an outcome o fulfills an objective j to an agent i, we use objective functions: for each agent i, we define is interests using the objective vector function fi = [fij ] : O → Rni . • Value functions: Instead of directly evaluating an outcome o, agent i looks at how much his objectives are fulfilled and will make a valuation based on these more basic criteria.",
        "Thus, for each agent i, there is a value function σi : Rni → R. In particular, Raiffa [17] shows how to systematically construct an additive value function to each party involved in a negotiation. • Utility: Now, given an outcome o ∈ O, an agent i is able to determine its value, i.e., σi(fi(o)).",

        "Agent A has a task T that needs to be done and also 100 units of a resource R. Agent B has the capacity to perform task T and would like to obtain at least 10 and at most 20 units of the resource R. Agent B is indifferent on any amount between 10 and 20 units of the resource R. The objective functions for both agents A and B are cost and revenue.",
        "And they both aim at minimising costs while maximising revenues.",
        "Having T done generates for A a revenue rA,T while doing T incurs a cost cB,T to B.",
        "Agent B obtains a revenue rB,R for each unit of the resource R while providing each unit of the resource R costs agent A cA,R.",
        "Assuming that money transfer between agents is possible, the set Att then contains three attributes: • T, taking values from the set {0, 1}, indicates whether the task T is assigned to agent B; • R, taking values from the set of non-negative integer, indicates the amount of resource R being allocated to agent B; and • MT, taking values from R, indicates the payment p to be transferred from A to B.",
        "Consider the outcome o = [T = 1, R = k, MT = p], i.e., the task T is assigned to B, and A allocates to B with k units of the resource R, and A transfers p dollars to B.",
        "Then, costA(o) = k.cA,R + p and revA(o) = rA,T ; and costB(o) = cB,T and revA(o) = j k.rB,R + p if 10 ≤ k ≤ 20 p otherwise.",
        "And, σi(costi(o), revi(o)) = revi(o) − costi(o), (i = A, B). 3.",
        "PROBLEM FORMALISATION Consider Example 1, assume that rA,T = $150 and cB,T = $100 and rB,R = $10 and cA,R = $7.",
        "That is, the revenues generated for A exceeds the costs incurred to B to do task T, and B values resource R more highly than the cost for A to provide it.",
        "The optimal solution to this problem scenario is to assign task T to agent B and to allocate 20 units of resource R (i.e., the maximal amount of resource R required by agent B) from agent A to agent B.",
        "This outcome regarding the resource and task allocation problems leaves payoffs of $10 to agent A and $100 to agent B.2 Any other outcome would leave at least one of the agents worse off.",
        "In other words, the presented outcome is Pareto-efficient and should be part of the solution outcome for this problem scenario.",
        "However, as the agents still have to bargain over the amount of money transfer p, neither agent would be willing to disclose their respective costs and revenues regarding the task T and the resource R. As a consequence, agents often do not achieve the optimal outcome presented above in practice.",
        "To address this issue, we introduce a mediator to help the agents discover better agreements than the ones they might try to settle on.",
        "Note that this problem is essentially the problem of searching for joint gains in a multilateral negotiation in which the involved parties hold strategic information, i.e., the integrative part in a negotiation.",
        "In order to help facilitate this process, we introduce the role of a neutral mediator.",
        "Before formalising the decision problems faced by the mediator and the 2 Certainly, without money transfer to compensate agent A, this outcome is not a fair one. negotiating agents, we discuss the properties of the solution outcomes to be achieved by the mediator.",
        "In a negotiation setting, the two typical design goals would be: • Efficiency: Avoid the agents from settling on an outcome that is not Pareto-optimal; and • Fairness: Avoid agreements that give the most of the gains to a subset of agents while leaving the rest with too little.",
        "The above goals are axiomatised in Nashs seminal work [16] on cooperative negotiation games.",
        "Essentially, Nash advocates for the following properties to be satisfied by solution to the bilateral negotiation problem: (i) it produces only Pareto-optimal outcomes; (ii) it is invariant to affine transformation (to the consequence space); (iii) it is symmetric; and (iv) it is independent from irrelevant alternatives.",
        "A solution satisfying Nashs axioms is called a Nash bargaining solution.",
        "It then turns out that, by taking the negotiators utilities as its objectives the mediator itself faces a multi-criteria decision making problem.",
        "The issues faced by the mediator are: (i) the mediator requires access to the negotiators utility functions, and (ii) making (fair) tradeoffs between different agents utilities.",
        "Our methods allow the agents to repeatedly interact with the mediator so that a Nash solution outcome could be found by the parties.",
        "Informally, the problem faced by both the mediator and the negotiators is construction of the indifference curves.",
        "Why are the indifference curves so important? • To the negotiators, knowing the options available along indifference curves opens up opportunities to reach more efficient outcomes.",
        "For instance, consider an agent A who is presenting his opponent with an offer θA which she refuses to accept.",
        "Rather than having to concede, A could look at his indifference curve going through θA and choose another proposal θA.",
        "To him, θA and θA are indifferent but θA could give some gains to B and thus will be more acceptable to B.",
        "In other words, the outcome θA is more efficient than θA to these two negotiators. • To the mediator, constructing indifference curves requires a measure of fairness between the negotiators.",
        "The mediator needs to determine how much utility it needs to take away from the other negotiators to give a particular negotiator a specific gain G (in utility).",
        "In order to search for integrative solutions within the outcome space O, we characterise the relationship between the agents over the set of attributes Att.",
        "As the agents hold different objectives and have different capacities, it may be the case that changing between two values of a specific attribute implies different shifts in utility of the agents.",
        "However, the problem of finding the exact Paretooptimal set3 is NP-hard [2].",
        "Our approach is thus to solve this optimisation problem in two steps.",
        "In the first steps, the more manageable attributes will be solved.",
        "These are attributes that take a finite set of values.",
        "The result of this step would be a subset of outcomes that contains the Pareto-optimal set.",
        "In the second step, we employ an iterative procedure that allows the mediator to interact with the negotiators to find joint improvements that move towards a Pareto-optimal outcome.",

        "Thus, the agents have no incentive to overstate their utility regarding an outcome o: If o is the most preferred outcome to an agent i then he already assigns the maximal utility to o.",
        "On the other hand, if o is not the most preferred outcome to i then by overstating the utility he assigns to o, the agent i runs the risk of having to settle on an agreement which would give him less payoffs than he is supposed to receive.",
        "However, agents do have an incentive to understate their utility if the final settlement will be based on the above solutions alone.",
        "Essentially, the mechanism to avoid an agent to understate his utility regarding particular outcomes is to guarantee a certain measure of fairness for the final settlement.",
        "That is, the agents lose the incentive to be dishonest to obtain gains from taking advantage of the known solutions to determine the settlement outcome for they would be offset by the fairness maintenance mechanism.",

        "However, when the set Simp contains more than one attribute and none of the attributes strongly dominate the other attributes then the above problem disminishes by itself thanks to the integrative solution.",
        "We of course have to define clearly what it means for an attribute to strongly dominate other attributes.",
        "Intuitively, if most of an agents utility concentrates on one of the attributes then this attribute strongly dominates other attributes.",

        "This is similar to the common practice in operations research in which linear programming solutions/techniques are applied to integer programming problems.",
        "We denote the number of continuous attributes by k, i.e., Att = Simp ∪ Simp and |Simp| = k. Then, the outcome space O can be represented as follows: O = ( Q j∈Simp V alj) × ( Q l∈Simp V all), where Q l∈Simp V all ⊆ Rk is the continuous component of O.",
        "Let Oc denote the set Q l∈Simp V all.",
        "Well refer to Oc as the feasible set and assume that Oc is closed and convex.",
        "After carrying out the optimisation over the set of simple attributes, we are able to assign the optimal values to the simple attributes from Simp.",
        "Thus, we reduce the original problem to the problem of searching for optimal (and fair) outcomes within the feasible set Oc .",
        "Recall that, by Assumption 1, we can characterise agent is utility function as follows: ui([v∗ Simp, vSimp]) = C + wi 2 ∗ ui,2([vSimp]), where C is the constant wi 1 ∗ ui,1([v∗ Simp]) and v∗ Simp denotes the optimal values of the simple attributes in Simp.",
        "Hence, without loss of generality (albeit with a blatant abuse of notation), we can take the agent is utility function as ui : Rk → [0, 1].",

(ii) How to find the more efficient agreement xh+1, given the current tentative agreement xh? 4.2.1 Determining a fair initial tentative agreement It should be emphasised that the choice of the initial tentative agreement affects the fairness of the final agreement to be reached by the presented method.",

        "For each attribute j ∈ Simp, an agent i will be asked to discretely submit three values (from the set V alj): the most preferred value, denoted by pvi,j, the least preferred value, denoted by wvi,j, and a value that gives i an approximately average payoff, denoted by avi,j. (Note that this is possible because the set V alj is bounded.)",
        "If pv1,j and pv2,j are sufficiently close, i.e., |pv1,j − pv2,j| < Δ for some pre-defined Δ > 0, then pv1,j and pv2,j are chosen to be the two core values, denoted by cv1 and cv2.",

                "However, because of the Negotiators Dilemma and given even bargaining power and incomplete information, the following two undesirable situations often arise: (i) negotiators reach inefficient compromises, or (ii) negotiators engage in a deadlock situation in which both negotiators refuse to act upon with incomplete information and at the same time do not want to disclose more information.",

As an act, or decision, a in A may involve multiple aspects, we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of attributes j; (j = 1, . . . , m). (Attributes are also referred to as issues, or decision variables.)",
                "A typical decision maker also has several objectives X1, . . . , Xk.",
                "We assume that Xi, (i = 1, . . . , k), maps the alternatives to real numbers.",
                "Thus, a tuple (x1, . . . , xk) = (X1(a), . . . , Xk(a)) denotes the consequence of the act a to the decision maker M. By definition, objectives are statements that delineate the desires of a decision maker.",
                "Thus, M wishes to maximise his objectives.",
                "However, as discussed thoroughly by Keeney and Raiffa [8], it is quite likely that a decision makers objectives will conflict with each other in that the improved achievement with one objective can only be accomplished at the expense of another.",
                "For instance, most businesses and public services have objectives like minimise cost and maximise the quality of services.",
                "Since better services can often only be attained for a price, these objectives conflict.",
                "Due to the conflicting nature of a decision makers objectives, M usually has to settle at a compromise solution.",
                "That is, he may have to choose an act a ∈ A that does not optimise every objective.",
                "This is the topic of the multi-criteria decision making theory.",
                "Part of the solution to this problem is that M has to try to identify the Pareto frontier in the consequence space {(X1(a), . . . , Xk(a))}a∈A.",
                "DEFINITION 1. (Dominant) Let x = (x1, . . . , xk) and x = (x1, . . . , xk) be two consequences. x dominates x iff xi > xi for all i, and the inequality is strict for at least one i.",
                "The Pareto frontier in a consequence space then consists of all consequences that are not dominated by any other consequence.",
                "This is illustrated in Fig. 1 in which an alternative consists of two attributes d1 and d2 and the decision maker tries to maximise the two objectives X1 and X2.",

                "Consider the outcome o = [T = 1, R = k, MT = p], i.e., the task T is assigned to B, and A allocates to B with k units of the resource R, and A transfers p dollars to B.",

                "They refer to this problem as the Negotiators Dilemma.",
                "We argue that the Negotiators Dilemma is essentially informationbased, due to the private information held by the agents.",
                "Such private information contains both the information that implies the agents bottom lines (or, her walk-away positions) and the information that enforces her bargaining strength.",
                "For instance, when bargaining to sell a house to a potential buyer, the seller would try to hide her actual reserve price as much as possible for she hopes to reach an agreement at a much higher price than her reserve price.",
                "On the other hand, the outside options available to her (e.g. other buyers who have expressed genuine interest with fairly good offers) consist in the information that improves her bargaining strength about which she would like to convey to her opponent.",
                "But at the same time, her opponent is well aware of the fact that it is her incentive to boost her bargaining strength and thus will not accept every information she sends out unless it is substantiated by evidence.",
                "Coming back to the Negotiators Dilemma, its not always possible to separate the integrative bargaining process from the distributive bargaining process.",
                "In fact, more often than not, the two processes interplay with each other making information manipulation become part of the integrative bargaining process.",
                "This is because a negotiator could use the information about his opponents interests against her during the distributive negotiation process.",
                "That is, a negotiator may refuse to concede on an important conflicting issue by claiming that he has made a major concession (on another issue) to meet his opponents interests even though the concession he made could be insignificant to him.",
                "For instance, few buyers would start a bargaining with a dealer over a deal for a notebook computer by declaring that he is most interested in an extended warranty for the item and therefore prepared to pay a high price to get such an extended warranty.",

                "However, because of the Negotiators Dilemma and given even bargaining power and incomplete information, the following two undesirable situations often arise: (i) negotiators reach <br>inefficient compromise</br>s, or (ii) negotiators engage in a deadlock situation in which both negotiators refuse to act upon with incomplete information and at the same time do not want to disclose more information.",
                "In this paper, we argue for the role of a mediator to resolve the above two issues.",
                "The mediator thus plays two roles in a negotiation: (i) to encourage cooperative behaviour among the negotiators, and (ii) to absorb the information disclosure by the negotiators to prevent negotiators from using uncertainty and private information as a strategic device.",

                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Multi-criteria decision making theory Let A denote the set of feasible alternatives available to a decision maker M. As an act, or decision, a in A may involve multiple aspects, we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of attributes j; (j = 1, . . . , m). (Attributes are also referred to as issues, or decision variables.)",
                "A typical decision maker also has several objectives X1, . . . , Xk.",
                "We assume that Xi, (i = 1, . . . , k), maps the alternatives to real numbers.",
                "Thus, a tuple (x1, . . . , xk) = (X1(a), . . . , Xk(a)) denotes the consequence of the act a to the decision maker M. By definition, objectives are statements that delineate the desires of a decision maker.",
                "Thus, M wishes to maximise his objectives.",
                "However, as discussed thoroughly by Keeney and Raiffa [8], it is quite likely that a decision makers objectives will conflict with each other in that the improved achievement with one objective can only be accomplished at the expense of another.",
                "For instance, most businesses and public services have objectives like minimise cost and maximise the quality of services.",
                "Since better services can often only be attained for a price, these objectives conflict.",
                "Due to the conflicting nature of a decision makers objectives, M usually has to settle at a compromise solution.",
                "That is, he may have to choose an act a ∈ A that does not optimise every objective.",
                "This is the topic of the multi-criteria decision making theory.",
                "Part of the solution to this problem is that M has to try to identify the Pareto frontier in the consequence space {(X1(a), . . . , Xk(a))}a∈A.",
                "DEFINITION 1. (Dominant) Let x = (x1, . . . , xk) and x = (x1, . . . , xk) be two consequences. x dominates x iff xi > xi for all i, and the inequality is strict for at least one i.",
                "The Pareto frontier in a consequence space then consists of all consequences that are not dominated by any other consequence.",
                "This is illustrated in Fig. 1 in which an alternative consists of two attributes d1 and d2 and the decision maker tries to maximise the two objectives X1 and X2.",

                "MCDM theorists introduce a mechanism to allow the objective components of consequences to be normalised to the payoff valuations for the objectives.",
                "Consequences can then be ordered: if the gains in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2) equals to the losses in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2), then the two consequences C1 and C2 are considered indifferent.",

                "To measure how much an outcome o fulfills an objective j to an agent i, we use objective functions: for each agent i, we define is interests using the objective vector function fi = [fij ] : O → Rni . • Value functions: Instead of directly evaluating an outcome o, agent i looks at how much his objectives are fulfilled and will make a valuation based on these more basic criteria.",

                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Multi-criteria decision making theory Let A denote the set of feasible alternatives available to a decision maker M. As an act, or decision, a in A may involve multiple aspects, we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of attributes j; (j = 1, . . . , m). (Attributes are also referred to as issues, or decision variables.)",
                "A typical decision maker also has several objectives X1, . . . , Xk.",
                "We assume that Xi, (i = 1, . . . , k), maps the alternatives to real numbers.",
                "Thus, a tuple (x1, . . . , xk) = (X1(a), . . . , Xk(a)) denotes the consequence of the act a to the decision maker M. By definition, objectives are statements that delineate the desires of a decision maker.",
                "Thus, M wishes to maximise his objectives.",
                "However, as discussed thoroughly by Keeney and Raiffa [8], it is quite likely that a decision makers objectives will conflict with each other in that the improved achievement with one objective can only be accomplished at the expense of another.",
                "For instance, most businesses and public services have objectives like minimise cost and maximise the quality of services.",
                "Since better services can often only be attained for a price, these objectives conflict.",
                "Due to the conflicting nature of a decision makers objectives, M usually has to settle at a compromise solution.",
                "That is, he may have to choose an act a ∈ A that does not optimise every objective.",
                "This is the topic of the multi-criteria decision making theory.",
                "Part of the solution to this problem is that M has to try to identify the Pareto frontier in the consequence space {(X1(a), . . . , Xk(a))}a∈A.",
                "DEFINITION 1. (Dominant) Let x = (x1, . . . , xk) and x = (x1, . . . , xk) be two consequences. x dominates x iff xi > xi for all i, and the inequality is strict for at least one i.",
                "The Pareto frontier in a consequence space then consists of all consequences that are not dominated by any other consequence.",
                "This is illustrated in Fig. 1 in which an alternative consists of two attributes d1 and d2 and the decision maker tries to maximise the two objectives X1 and X2.",
                "A decision a ∈ A whose consequence does not lie on the Pareto frontier is inefficient.",

                "MCDM theorists introduce a mechanism to allow the objective components of consequences to be normalised to the payoff valuations for the objectives.",
                "Consequences can then be ordered: if the gains in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2) equals to the losses in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2), then the two consequences C1 and C2 are considered indifferent.",

                "To measure how much an outcome o fulfills an objective j to an agent i, we use objective functions: for each agent i, we define is interests using the objective vector function fi = [fij ] : O → Rni . • Value functions: Instead of directly evaluating an outcome o, agent i looks at how much his objectives are fulfilled and will make a valuation based on these more basic criteria.",

As an act, or decision, a in A may involve multiple aspects, we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of attributes j; (j = 1, . . . , m). (Attributes are also referred to as issues, or decision variables.)",

                "We argue that the Negotiators <br>dilemma</br> is essentially informationbased, due to the private information held by the agents.",
                "Such private information contains both the information that implies the agents bottom lines (or, her walk-away positions) and the information that enforces her bargaining strength.",
                "For instance, when bargaining to sell a house to a potential buyer, the seller would try to hide her actual reserve price as much as possible for she hopes to reach an agreement at a much higher price than her reserve price.",
                "On the other hand, the outside options available to her (e.g. other buyers who have expressed genuine interest with fairly good offers) consist in the information that improves her bargaining strength about which she would like to convey to her opponent.",
                "But at the same time, her opponent is well aware of the fact that it is her incentive to boost her bargaining strength and thus will not accept every information she sends out unless it is substantiated by evidence.",

                "This is because a negotiator could use the information about his opponents interests against her during the distributive negotiation process.",
                "That is, a negotiator may refuse to concede on an important conflicting issue by claiming that he has made a major concession (on another issue) to meet his opponents interests even though the concession he made could be insignificant to him.",
                "For instance, few buyers would start a bargaining with a dealer over a deal for a notebook computer by declaring that he is most interested in an extended warranty for the item and therefore prepared to pay a high price to get such an extended warranty.",

                "However, because of the Negotiators <br>dilemma</br> and given even bargaining power and incomplete information, the following two undesirable situations often arise: (i) negotiators reach inefficient compromises, or (ii) negotiators engage in a deadlock situation in which both negotiators refuse to act upon with incomplete information and at the same time do not want to disclose more information.",
                "In this paper, we argue for the role of a mediator to resolve the above two issues.",
                "The mediator thus plays two roles in a negotiation: (i) to encourage cooperative behaviour among the negotiators, and (ii) to absorb the information disclosure by the negotiators to prevent negotiators from using uncertainty and private information as a strategic device.",

                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Multi-criteria decision making theory Let A denote the set of feasible alternatives available to a decision maker M. As an act, or decision, a in A may involve multiple aspects, we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of attributes j; (j = 1, . . . , m). (Attributes are also referred to as issues, or decision variables.)",
                "A typical decision maker also has several objectives X1, . . . , Xk.",
                "We assume that Xi, (i = 1, . . . , k), maps the alternatives to real numbers.",
                "Thus, a tuple (x1, . . . , xk) = (X1(a), . . . , Xk(a)) denotes the consequence of the act a to the decision maker M. By definition, objectives are statements that delineate the desires of a decision maker.",
                "Thus, M wishes to maximise his objectives.",
                "However, as discussed thoroughly by Keeney and Raiffa [8], it is quite likely that a decision makers objectives will conflict with each other in that the improved achievement with one objective can only be accomplished at the expense of another.",
                "For instance, most businesses and public services have objectives like minimise cost and maximise the quality of services.",
                "Since better services can often only be attained for a price, these objectives conflict.",
                "Due to the conflicting nature of a decision makers objectives, M usually has to settle at a compromise solution.",
                "That is, he may have to choose an act a ∈ A that does not optimise every objective.",
                "This is the topic of the multi-criteria decision making theory.",
                "Part of the solution to this problem is that M has to try to identify the Pareto frontier in the consequence space {(X1(a), . . . , Xk(a))}a∈A.",
                "DEFINITION 1. (Dominant) Let x = (x1, . . . , xk) and x = (x1, . . . , xk) be two consequences. x dominates x iff xi > xi for all i, and the inequality is strict for at least one i.",
                "The Pareto frontier in a consequence space then consists of all consequences that are not dominated by any other consequence.",
                "This is illustrated in Fig. 1 in which an alternative consists of two attributes d1 and d2 and the decision maker tries to maximise the two objectives X1 and X2.",
                "A decision a ∈ A whose consequence does not lie on the Pareto frontier is inefficient.",

                "MCDM theorists introduce a mechanism to allow the objective components of consequences to be normalised to the payoff valuations for the objectives.",
                "Consequences can then be ordered: if the gains in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2) equals to the losses in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2), then the two consequences C1 and C2 are considered indifferent.",

                "To measure how much an outcome o fulfills an objective j to an agent i, we use objective functions: for each agent i, we define is interests using the objective vector function fi = [fij ] : O → Rni . • Value functions: Instead of directly evaluating an outcome o, agent i looks at how much his objectives are fulfilled and will make a valuation based on these more basic criteria.",
                "Thus, for each agent i, there is a value function σi : Rni → R. In particular, Raiffa [17] shows how to systematically construct an additive value function to each party involved in a negotiation. • Utility: Now, given an outcome o ∈ O, an agent i is able to determine its value, i.e., σi(fi(o)).",

                "Consider the outcome o = [T = 1, R = k, MT = p], i.e., the task T is assigned to B, and A allocates to B with k units of the resource R, and A transfers p dollars to B.",

                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Multi-criteria decision making theory Let A denote the set of feasible alternatives available to a decision maker M. As an act, or decision, a in A may involve multiple aspects, we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of attributes j; (j = 1, . . . , m). (Attributes are also referred to as issues, or decision variables.)",
                "A typical decision maker also has several objectives X1, . . . , Xk.",
                "We assume that Xi, (i = 1, . . . , k), maps the alternatives to real numbers.",
                "Thus, a tuple (x1, . . . , xk) = (X1(a), . . . , Xk(a)) denotes the consequence of the act a to the decision maker M. By definition, objectives are statements that delineate the desires of a decision maker.",
                "Thus, M wishes to maximise his objectives.",
                "However, as discussed thoroughly by Keeney and Raiffa [8], it is quite likely that a decision makers objectives will conflict with each other in that the improved achievement with one objective can only be accomplished at the expense of another.",
                "For instance, most businesses and public services have objectives like minimise cost and maximise the quality of services.",
                "Since better services can often only be attained for a price, these objectives conflict.",
                "Due to the conflicting nature of a decision makers objectives, M usually has to settle at a compromise solution.",
                "That is, he may have to choose an act a ∈ A that does not optimise every objective.",
                "This is the topic of the multi-criteria decision making theory.",
                "Part of the solution to this problem is that M has to try to identify the Pareto frontier in the consequence space {(X1(a), . . . , Xk(a))}a∈A.",
                "DEFINITION 1. (Dominant) Let x = (x1, . . . , xk) and x = (x1, . . . , xk) be two consequences. x dominates x iff xi > xi for all i, and the inequality is strict for at least one i.",
                "The Pareto frontier in a consequence space then consists of all consequences that are not dominated by any other consequence.",
                "This is illustrated in Fig. 1 in which an alternative consists of two attributes d1 and d2 and the decision maker tries to maximise the two objectives X1 and X2.",

                "MCDM theorists introduce a mechanism to allow the objective components of consequences to be normalised to the payoff valuations for the objectives.",
                "Consequences can then be ordered: if the gains in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2) equals to the losses in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2), then the two consequences C1 and C2 are considered indifferent.",

                "To measure how much an outcome o fulfills an objective j to an agent i, we use objective functions: for each agent i, we define is interests using the objective vector function fi = [fij ] : O → Rni . • Value functions: Instead of directly evaluating an outcome o, agent i looks at how much his objectives are fulfilled and will make a valuation based on these more basic criteria.",
                "Thus, for each agent i, there is a value function σi : Rni → R. In particular, Raiffa [17] shows how to systematically construct an additive value function to each party involved in a negotiation. • Utility: Now, given an outcome o ∈ O, an agent i is able to determine its value, i.e., σi(fi(o)).",

                "According to conflict theorists Lax and Sebenius [13], most negotiation actually involves both integrative and distributive bargaining which they refer to as creating value and claiming value.",
                "They argue that negotiation necessarily includes both cooperative and competitive elements, and that these elements exist in tension.",
                "Negotiators face a dilemma in deciding whether to pursue a cooperative or a competitive strategy at a particular time during a negotiation.",
                "They refer to this problem as the Negotiators Dilemma.",
                "We argue that the Negotiators Dilemma is essentially informationbased, due to the private information held by the agents.",
                "Such private information contains both the information that implies the agents bottom lines (or, her walk-away positions) and the information that enforces her bargaining strength.",
                "For instance, when bargaining to sell a house to a potential buyer, the seller would try to hide her actual reserve price as much as possible for she hopes to reach an agreement at a much higher price than her reserve price.",
                "On the other hand, the outside options available to her (e.g. other buyers who have expressed genuine interest with fairly good offers) consist in the information that improves her bargaining strength about which she would like to convey to her opponent.",
                "But at the same time, her opponent is well aware of the fact that it is her incentive to boost her bargaining strength and thus will not accept every information she sends out unless it is substantiated by evidence.",
                "Coming back to the Negotiators Dilemma, its not always possible to separate the integrative bargaining process from the distributive bargaining process.",
                "In fact, more often than not, the two processes interplay with each other making information manipulation become part of the integrative bargaining process.",
                "This is because a negotiator could use the information about his opponents interests against her during the distributive negotiation process.",
                "That is, a negotiator may refuse to concede on an important conflicting issue by claiming that he has made a major concession (on another issue) to meet his opponents interests even though the concession he made could be insignificant to him.",
                "For instance, few buyers would start a bargaining with a dealer over a deal for a notebook computer by declaring that he is most interested in an extended warranty for the item and therefore prepared to pay a high price to get such an extended warranty.",
                "Negotiation Support Systems (NSSs) and negotiating software 508 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS agents (NSAs) have been introduced either to assist humans in making decisions or to enable automated negotiation to allow computer processes to engage in meaningful negotiation to reach agreements (see, for instance, [14, 15, 19, 6, 5]).",
                "However, because of the Negotiators Dilemma and given even bargaining power and incomplete information, the following two undesirable situations often arise: (i) negotiators reach inefficient compromises, or (ii) negotiators engage in a <br>deadlock situation</br> in which both negotiators refuse to act upon with incomplete information and at the same time do not want to disclose more information.",
                "In this paper, we argue for the role of a mediator to resolve the above two issues.",
                "The mediator thus plays two roles in a negotiation: (i) to encourage cooperative behaviour among the negotiators, and (ii) to absorb the information disclosure by the negotiators to prevent negotiators from using uncertainty and private information as a strategic device.",
                "To take advantage of existing results in negotiation analysis and operations research (OR) literatures [18], we employ multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) theory to allow the negotiation problem to be represented and analysed.",
                "Section 2 provides background on MCDM theory and the negotiation framework.",
                "Section 3 formulates the problem.",
                "In Section 4, we discuss our approach to integrative negotiation.",
                "Section 5 discusses the future work with some concluding remarks. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Multi-criteria decision making theory Let A denote the set of feasible alternatives available to a decision maker M. As an act, or decision, a in A may involve multiple aspects, we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of attributes j; (j = 1, . . . , m). (Attributes are also referred to as issues, or decision variables.)",
                "A typical decision maker also has several objectives X1, . . . , Xk.",
                "We assume that Xi, (i = 1, . . . , k), maps the alternatives to real numbers.",
                "Thus, a tuple (x1, . . . , xk) = (X1(a), . . . , Xk(a)) denotes the consequence of the act a to the decision maker M. By definition, objectives are statements that delineate the desires of a decision maker.",
                "Thus, M wishes to maximise his objectives.",
                "However, as discussed thoroughly by Keeney and Raiffa [8], it is quite likely that a decision makers objectives will conflict with each other in that the improved achievement with one objective can only be accomplished at the expense of another.",
                "For instance, most businesses and public services have objectives like minimise cost and maximise the quality of services.",
                "Since better services can often only be attained for a price, these objectives conflict.",
                "Due to the conflicting nature of a decision makers objectives, M usually has to settle at a compromise solution.",
                "That is, he may have to choose an act a ∈ A that does not optimise every objective.",
                "This is the topic of the multi-criteria decision making theory.",
                "Part of the solution to this problem is that M has to try to identify the Pareto frontier in the consequence space {(X1(a), . . . , Xk(a))}a∈A.",
                "DEFINITION 1. (Dominant) Let x = (x1, . . . , xk) and x = (x1, . . . , xk) be two consequences. x dominates x iff xi > xi for all i, and the inequality is strict for at least one i.",
                "The Pareto frontier in a consequence space then consists of all consequences that are not dominated by any other consequence.",
                "This is illustrated in Fig. 1 in which an alternative consists of two attributes d1 and d2 and the decision maker tries to maximise the two objectives X1 and X2.",
                "A decision a ∈ A whose consequence does not lie on the Pareto frontier is inefficient.",
                "While the Pareto 1x d2 a (X (a),X (a)) d1 1 x2 2 Alternative spaceA Pareto frontier Consequence space optimal consequenc Figure 1: The Pareto frontier frontier allows M to avoid taking inefficient decisions, M still has to decide which of the efficient consequences on the Pareto frontier is most preferred by him.",
                "MCDM theorists introduce a mechanism to allow the objective components of consequences to be normalised to the payoff valuations for the objectives.",
                "Consequences can then be ordered: if the gains in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2) equals to the losses in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2), then the two consequences C1 and C2 are considered indifferent.",
                "M can now construct the set of indifference curves1 in the consequence space (the dashed curves in Fig. 1).",
                "The most preferred indifference curve that intersects with the Pareto frontier is in focus: its intersection with the Pareto frontier is the sought after consequence (i.e., the optimal consequence in Fig. 1). 2.2 A negotiation framework A multi-agent negotiation framework consists of: 1.",

                "An outcome o ∈ O is represented by an assignment of values to the corresponding attributes in Att. 4.",
                "Agents utility: Based on the theory of multiple-criteria decision making [8], we define the agents utility as follows: • Objectives: Agent i has a set of ni objectives, or interests; denoted by j (j = 1, . . . , ni).",
                "To measure how much an outcome o fulfills an objective j to an agent i, we use objective functions: for each agent i, we define is interests using the objective vector function fi = [fij ] : O → Rni . • Value functions: Instead of directly evaluating an outcome o, agent i looks at how much his objectives are fulfilled and will make a valuation based on these more basic criteria.",
                "Thus, for each agent i, there is a value function σi : Rni → R. In particular, Raiffa [17] shows how to systematically construct an additive value function to each party involved in a negotiation. • Utility: Now, given an outcome o ∈ O, an agent i is able to determine its value, i.e., σi(fi(o)).",
                "However, a negotiation infrastructure is usually required to facilitate negotiation.",
                "This might involve other mechanisms and factors/parties, e.g., a mediator, a legal institution, participation fees, etc.",

                "Agent A has a task T that needs to be done and also 100 units of a resource R. Agent B has the capacity to perform task T and would like to obtain at least 10 and at most 20 units of the resource R. Agent B is indifferent on any amount between 10 and 20 units of the resource R. The objective functions for both agents A and B are cost and revenue.",

                "Consider the outcome o = [T = 1, R = k, MT = p], i.e., the task T is assigned to B, and A allocates to B with k units of the resource R, and A transfers p dollars to B.",

                "That is, the revenues generated for A exceeds the costs incurred to B to do task T, and B values resource R more highly than the cost for A to provide it.",
                "The optimal solution to this problem scenario is to assign task T to agent B and to allocate 20 units of resource R (i.e., the maximal amount of resource R required by agent B) from agent A to agent B.",

As a consequence, agents often do not achieve the optimal outcome presented above in practice.",

                "In a negotiation setting, the two typical design goals would be: • Efficiency: Avoid the agents from settling on an outcome that is not Pareto-optimal; and • Fairness: Avoid agreements that give the most of the gains to a subset of agents while leaving the rest with too little.",

                "For instance, few buyers would start a bargaining with a dealer over a deal for a notebook computer by declaring that he is most interested in an extended warranty for the item and therefore prepared to pay a high price to get such an extended warranty.",

                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Multi-criteria decision making theory Let A denote the set of feasible alternatives available to a decision maker M. As an act, or decision, a in A may involve multiple aspects, we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of attributes j; (j = 1, . . . , m). (Attributes are also referred to as issues, or decision variables.)",
                "A typical decision maker also has several objectives X1, . . . , Xk.",
                "We assume that Xi, (i = 1, . . . , k), maps the alternatives to real numbers.",
                "Thus, a tuple (x1, . . . , xk) = (X1(a), . . . , Xk(a)) denotes the consequence of the act a to the decision maker M. By definition, objectives are statements that delineate the desires of a decision maker.",
                "Thus, M wishes to maximise his objectives.",
                "However, as discussed thoroughly by Keeney and Raiffa [8], it is quite likely that a decision makers objectives will conflict with each other in that the improved achievement with one objective can only be accomplished at the expense of another.",
                "For instance, most businesses and public services have objectives like minimise cost and maximise the quality of services.",
                "Since better services can often only be attained for a price, these objectives conflict.",
                "Due to the conflicting nature of a decision makers objectives, M usually has to settle at a compromise solution.",
                "That is, he may have to choose an act a ∈ A that does not optimise every objective.",
                "This is the topic of the multi-criteria decision making theory.",
                "Part of the solution to this problem is that M has to try to identify the Pareto frontier in the consequence space {(X1(a), . . . , Xk(a))}a∈A.",
                "DEFINITION 1. (Dominant) Let x = (x1, . . . , xk) and x = (x1, . . . , xk) be two consequences. x dominates x iff xi > xi for all i, and the inequality is strict for at least one i.",
                "The Pareto frontier in a consequence space then consists of all consequences that are not dominated by any other consequence.",
                "This is illustrated in Fig. 1 in which an alternative consists of two attributes d1 and d2 and the decision maker tries to maximise the two objectives X1 and X2.",
                "A decision a ∈ A whose consequence does not lie on the Pareto frontier is inefficient.",

                "MCDM theorists introduce a mechanism to allow the objective components of consequences to be normalised to the payoff valuations for the objectives.",
                "Consequences can then be ordered: if the gains in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2) equals to the losses in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2), then the two consequences C1 and C2 are considered indifferent.",

                "To measure how much an outcome o fulfills an objective j to an agent i, we use objective functions: for each agent i, we define is interests using the objective vector function fi = [fij ] : O → Rni . • Value functions: Instead of directly evaluating an outcome o, agent i looks at how much his objectives are fulfilled and will make a valuation based on these more basic criteria.",

In particular, Raiffa [17] shows how to systematically construct an additive value function to each party involved in a negotiation. • Utility: Now, given an outcome o ∈ O, an agent i is able to determine its value, i.e., σi(fi(o)).",

                "Consider the outcome o = [T = 1, R = k, MT = p], i.e., the task T is assigned to B, and A allocates to B with k units of the resource R, and A transfers p dollars to B.",

As a consequence, agents often do not achieve the optimal outcome presented above in practice.",

As an act, or decision, a in A may involve multiple aspects, we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of attributes j; (j = 1, . . . , m). (Attributes are also referred to as issues, or decision variables.)",

                "Since better services can often only be attained for a price, these objectives conflict.",

As an act, or decision, a in A may involve multiple aspects, we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of attributes j; (j = 1, . . . , m). (Attributes are also referred to as issues, or decision variables.)",
                "A typical decision maker also has several objectives X1, . . . , Xk.",
                "We assume that Xi, (i = 1, . . . , k), maps the alternatives to real numbers.",
                "Thus, a tuple (x1, . . . , xk) = (X1(a), . . . , Xk(a)) denotes the consequence of the act a to the decision maker M. By definition, objectives are statements that delineate the desires of a decision maker.",
                "Thus, M wishes to maximise his objectives.",
                "However, as discussed thoroughly by Keeney and Raiffa [8], it is quite likely that a decision makers objectives will conflict with each other in that the improved achievement with one objective can only be accomplished at the expense of another.",
                "For instance, most businesses and public services have objectives like minimise cost and maximise the quality of services.",
                "Since better services can often only be attained for a price, these objectives conflict.",
                "Due to the conflicting nature of a decision makers objectives, M usually has to settle at a compromise solution.",
                "That is, he may have to choose an act a ∈ A that does not optimise every objective.",
                "This is the topic of the multi-criteria decision making theory.",
                "Part of the solution to this problem is that M has to try to identify the Pareto frontier in the consequence space {(X1(a), . . . , Xk(a))}a∈A.",
                "DEFINITION 1. (Dominant) Let x = (x1, . . . , xk) and x = (x1, . . . , xk) be two consequences. x dominates x iff xi > xi for all i, and the inequality is strict for at least one i.",
                "The Pareto frontier in a consequence space then consists of all consequences that are not dominated by any other consequence.",
                "This is illustrated in Fig. 1 in which an alternative consists of two attributes d1 and d2 and the decision maker tries to maximise the two objectives X1 and X2.",

                "To measure how much an outcome o fulfills an objective j to an agent i, we use objective functions: for each agent i, we define is interests using the objective vector function fi = [fij ] : O → Rni . • Value functions: Instead of directly evaluating an outcome o, agent i looks at how much his objectives are fulfilled and will make a valuation based on these more basic criteria.",

                "Consider the outcome o = [T = 1, R = k, MT = p], i.e., the task T is assigned to B, and A allocates to B with k units of the resource R, and A transfers p dollars to B.",

As an act, or decision, a in A may involve multiple aspects, we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of attributes j; (j = 1, . . . , m). (Attributes are also referred to as issues, or decision variables.)",

                "However, as discussed thoroughly by Keeney and Raiffa [8], it is quite likely that a decision makers objectives will conflict with each other in that the improved achievement with one objective can only be accomplished at the expense of another.",
                "For instance, most businesses and public services have objectives like minimise cost and maximise the quality of services.",
                "Since better services can often only be attained for a price, these objectives conflict.",
                "Due to the conflicting nature of a decision makers objectives, M usually has to settle at a compromise solution.",
                "That is, he may have to choose an act a ∈ A that does not optimise every objective.",
                "This is the topic of the multi-criteria decision making theory.",
                "Part of the solution to this problem is that M has to try to identify the Pareto frontier in the consequence space {(X1(a), . . . , Xk(a))}a∈A.",
                "DEFINITION 1. (Dominant) Let x = (x1, . . . , xk) and x = (x1, . . . , xk) be two consequences. x dominates x iff xi > xi for all i, and the inequality is strict for at least one i.",
                "The Pareto frontier in a consequence space then consists of all consequences that are not dominated by any other consequence.",

                "For instance, few buyers would start a bargaining with a dealer over a deal for a notebook computer by declaring that he is most interested in an extended warranty for the item and therefore prepared to pay a high price to get such an extended warranty.",

As an act, or decision, a in A may involve multiple aspects, we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of attributes j; (j = 1, . . . , m). (Attributes are also referred to as issues, or decision variables.)",
                "A typical decision maker also has several objectives X1, . . . , Xk.",
                "We assume that Xi, (i = 1, . . . , k), maps the alternatives to real numbers.",
                "Thus, a tuple (x1, . . . , xk) = (X1(a), . . . , Xk(a)) denotes the consequence of the act a to the decision maker M. By definition, objectives are statements that delineate the desires of a decision maker.",
                "Thus, M wishes to maximise his objectives.",
                "However, as discussed thoroughly by Keeney and Raiffa [8], it is quite likely that a decision makers objectives will conflict with each other in that the improved achievement with one objective can only be accomplished at the expense of another.",
                "For instance, most businesses and public services have objectives like minimise cost and maximise the quality of services.",
                "Since better services can often only be attained for a price, these objectives conflict.",
                "Due to the conflicting nature of a decision makers objectives, M usually has to settle at a compromise solution.",
                "That is, he may have to choose an act a ∈ A that does not optimise every objective.",
                "This is the topic of the multi-criteria decision making theory.",
                "Part of the solution to this problem is that M has to try to identify the Pareto frontier in the consequence space {(X1(a), . . . , Xk(a))}a∈A.",
                "DEFINITION 1. (Dominant) Let x = (x1, . . . , xk) and x = (x1, . . . , xk) be two consequences. x dominates x iff xi > xi for all i, and the inequality is strict for at least one i.",
                "The Pareto frontier in a consequence space then consists of all consequences that are not dominated by any other consequence.",
                "This is illustrated in Fig. 1 in which an alternative consists of two attributes d1 and d2 and the decision maker tries to maximise the two objectives X1 and X2.",

                "For instance, when bargaining to sell a house to a potential buyer, the seller would try to hide her actual reserve price as much as possible for she hopes to reach an agreement at a much higher price than her reserve price.",
                "On the other hand, the outside options available to her (e.g. other buyers who have expressed genuine interest with fairly good offers) consist in the information that improves her bargaining strength about which she would like to convey to her opponent.",
                "But at the same time, her opponent is well aware of the fact that it is her incentive to boost her bargaining strength and thus will not accept every information she sends out unless it is substantiated by evidence.",

                "This is because a negotiator could use the information about his opponents interests against her during the distributive negotiation process.",
                "That is, a negotiator may refuse to concede on an important conflicting issue by claiming that he has made a major concession (on another issue) to meet his opponents interests even though the concession he made could be insignificant to him.",
                "For instance, few buyers would start a bargaining with a dealer over a deal for a notebook computer by declaring that he is most interested in an extended warranty for the item and therefore prepared to pay a high price to get such an extended warranty.",

                "However, because of the Negotiators Dilemma and given even bargaining power and incomplete information, the following two undesirable situations often arise: (i) negotiators reach inefficient compromises, or (ii) negotiators engage in a deadlock situation in which both negotiators refuse to act upon with incomplete information and at the same time do not want to disclose more information.",
                "In this paper, we argue for the role of a mediator to resolve the above two issues.",
                "The mediator thus plays two roles in a negotiation: (i) to encourage cooperative behaviour among the negotiators, and (ii) to absorb the information disclosure by the negotiators to prevent negotiators from using uncertainty and private information as a strategic device.",

                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Multi-criteria decision making theory Let A denote the set of feasible alternatives available to a decision maker M. As an act, or decision, a in A may involve multiple aspects, we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of attributes j; (j = 1, . . . , m). (Attributes are also referred to as issues, or decision variables.)",
                "A typical decision maker also has several objectives X1, . . . , Xk.",
                "We assume that Xi, (i = 1, . . . , k), maps the alternatives to real numbers.",
                "Thus, a tuple (x1, . . . , xk) = (X1(a), . . . , Xk(a)) denotes the consequence of the act a to the decision maker M. By definition, objectives are statements that delineate the desires of a decision maker.",
                "Thus, M wishes to maximise his objectives.",
                "However, as discussed thoroughly by Keeney and Raiffa [8], it is quite likely that a decision makers objectives will conflict with each other in that the improved achievement with one objective can only be accomplished at the expense of another.",
                "For instance, most businesses and public services have objectives like minimise cost and maximise the quality of services.",
                "Since better services can often only be attained for a price, these objectives conflict.",
                "Due to the conflicting nature of a decision makers objectives, M usually has to settle at a compromise solution.",
                "That is, he may have to choose an act a ∈ A that does not optimise every objective.",
                "This is the topic of the multi-criteria decision making theory.",
                "Part of the solution to this problem is that M has to try to identify the Pareto frontier in the consequence space {(X1(a), . . . , Xk(a))}a∈A.",
                "DEFINITION 1. (Dominant) Let x = (x1, . . . , xk) and x = (x1, . . . , xk) be two consequences. x dominates x iff xi > xi for all i, and the inequality is strict for at least one i.",
                "The Pareto frontier in a consequence space then consists of all consequences that are not dominated by any other consequence.",
                "This is illustrated in Fig. 1 in which an alternative consists of two attributes d1 and d2 and the decision maker tries to maximise the two objectives X1 and X2.",
                "A decision a ∈ A whose consequence does not lie on the Pareto frontier is inefficient.",

                "MCDM theorists introduce a mechanism to allow the objective components of consequences to be normalised to the payoff valuations for the objectives.",
                "Consequences can then be ordered: if the gains in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2) equals to the losses in satisfaction brought about by C1 (in comparison to C2), then the two consequences C1 and C2 are considered indifferent.",

                "To measure how much an outcome o fulfills an objective j to an agent i, we use objective functions: for each agent i, we define is interests using the objective vector function fi = [fij ] : O → Rni . • Value functions: Instead of directly evaluating an outcome o, agent i looks at how much his objectives are fulfilled and will make a valuation based on these more basic criteria.",

In particular, Raiffa [17] shows how to systematically construct an additive value function to each party involved in a negotiation. • Utility: Now, given an outcome o ∈ O, an agent i is able to determine its value, i.e., σi(fi(o)).",

                "Consider the outcome o = [T = 1, R = k, MT = p], i.e., the task T is assigned to B, and A allocates to B with k units of the resource R, and A transfers p dollars to B.",
