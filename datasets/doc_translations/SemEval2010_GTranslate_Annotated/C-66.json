San Jose, CA 95120 {phantom,wsl}@us.ibm.com ABSTRACT Web services can be aggregated to create composite workflows that provide streamlined functionality for human users or other systems. Although industry standards and recent research have sought to define best practices and to improve end-to-end workflow composition, one area that has not fully been explored is the scheduling of a workflows web service requests to actual service provisioning in a multi-tiered, multi-organisation environment. This issue is relevant to modern business scenarios where business processes within a workflow must complete within QoS-defined limits. Because these business processes are web service consumers, service requests must be mapped and scheduled across multiple web service providers, each with its own negotiated service level agreement. In this paper we provide heuristics for scheduling service requests from multiple business process workflows to web service providers such that a business value metric across all workflows is maximised. We show that a genetic search algorithm is appropriate to perform this scheduling, and through experimentation we show that our algorithm scales well up to a thousand workflows and produces better mappings than traditional approaches.

INTRODUCTION Web services can be composed into workflows to provide streamlined end-to-end functionality for human users or other systems. Although previous research efforts have looked at ways to intelligently automate the composition of web services into workflows (e.g. [1, 9]), an important remaining problem is the assignment of web service requests to the underlying web service providers in a multi-tiered runtime scenario within constraints. In this paper we address this scheduling problem and examine means to manage a large number of business process workflows in a scalable manner. The problem of scheduling web service requests to providers is relevant to modern business domains that depend on multi-tiered service provisioning. Consider the example shown in Figure 1 that illustrates our problem space. Workflows comprise multiple related business processes that are web service consumers; here we assume that the workflows represent requested service from customers or automated systems and that the workflow has already been composed with an existing choreography toolkit. These workflows are then submitted to a portal (not shown) that acts as a scheduling agent between the web service consumers and the web service providers. In this example, a workflow could represent the actions needed to instantiate a vacation itinerary, where one business process requests booking an airline ticket, another business process requests a hotel room, and so forth. Each of these requests target a particular service type (e.g. airline reservations, hotel reservations, car reservations, etc.), and for each service type, there are multiple instances of service providers that publish a web service interface. An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes, and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative business value metric for the workflow; intuitively, it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals. We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the web service providers and the scheduling agent such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency. The resulting problem is then to schedule and assign the business processes requests for service types to one of the service providers for that type. The scheduling must be done such that the aggregate business value across all the workflows is maximised. In Section 3 we state the scenario as a combinatorial problem and utilise a genetic search algorithm [5] to find the best assignment of web service requests to providers. This approach converges towards an assignment that maximises the overall business value for all the workflows. In Section 4 we show through experimentation that this search heuristic finds better assignments than other algorithms (greedy, round-robin, and proportional). Further, this approach allows us to scale the number of simultaneous workflows (up to one thousand workflows in our experiments) and yet still find effective schedules. 2. RELATED WORK In the context of service assignment and scheduling, [11] maps web service calls to potential servers using linear programming, but their work is concerned with mapping only single workflows; our principal focus is on scalably scheduling multiple workflows (up 30 Service Type SuperHotels.com Business Process Business Process Workflow ...

[10] presents a dynamic provisioning approach that uses both predictive and reactive techniques for multi-tiered Internet application delivery. However, the provisioning techniques do not consider the challenges faced when there are alternative query execution plans and replicated data sources. [8] presents a feedback-based scheduling mechanism for multi-tiered systems with back-end databases, but unlike our work, it assumes a tighter coupling between the various components of the system. Our work also builds upon prior scheduling research. The classic job-shop scheduling problem, shown to be NP-complete [4] [3], is similar to ours in that tasks within a job must be scheduled onto machinery (c.f. our scenario is that business processes within a workflow must be scheduled onto web service providers). The salient differences are that the machines can process only one job at a time (we assume servers can multi-task but with degraded performance and a maximum concurrency level), tasks within a job cannot simultaneously run on different machines (we assume business processes can be assigned to any available server), and the principal metric of performance is the makespan, which is the time for the last task among all the jobs to complete (and as we show later, optimising on the makespan is insufficient for scheduling the business processes, necessitating different metrics). 3. DESIGN In this section we describe our model and discuss how we can find scheduling assignments using a genetic search algorithm. 3.1 Model We base our model on the simplified scenario shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we assume that users or automated systems request the execution of a workflow. The workflows comprise business processes, each of which makes one web service invocation to a service type. Further, business processes have an ordering in the workflow. The arrangement and execution of the business processes and the data flow between them are all managed by a composition or choreography tool (e.g. [1, 9]). Although composition languages can use sophisticated flow-control mechanisms such as conditional branches, for simplicity we assume the processes execute sequentially in a given order. This scenario can be naturally extended to more complex relationships that can be expressed in BPEL [7], which defines how business processes interact, messages are exchanged, activities are ordered, and exceptions are handled. Due to space constraints, we focus on the problem space presented here and will extend our model to more advanced deployment scenarios in the future. Each workflow has a QoS requirement to complete within a specified number of time units (e.g. on the order of seconds, as detailed in the Experiments section). Upon completion (or failure), the workflow is assigned a business value. We extended this approach further and considered different types of workflow completion in order to model differentiated QoS levels that can be applied by businesses (for example, to provide tiered customer service). We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement, acceptable if it completes within a constant factor κ 31 of its QoS bound (in our experiments we chose κ=3), or failing if it finishes beyond κ times its QoS bound. For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing. The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others. Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers. We assume that the providers make service level agreements (SLAs) to guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a web service invocation. Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load. This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient. In our experiments we vary α, β, and γ with different distributions. Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows. However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit. The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows. Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows, it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed. This intuitive observation suggests that traditional scheduling approaches such as round-robin or proportional assignments will not fare well, which is what we observe and discuss in Section 4. On the other hand, an exhaustive search of all the possible assignments will find the best schedule, but the computational complexity is prohibitively high. Suppose there are W workflows with an average of B business processes per workflow. Further, in the worst case each business process requests one service type, for which there are P providers. There are thus W · PB combinations to explore to find the optimal assignments of business processes to providers. Even for small configurations (e.g. W =10, B=5, P=10), the computational time for exhaustive search is significant, and in our work we look to scale these parameters. In the next subsection, discuss how a genetic search algorithm can be used to converge toward the optimum scheduling assignments. 3.2 Genetic algorithm Given an exponential search space of business process assignments to web service providers, the problem is to find the optimal assignment that produces the overall highest aggregate business value across all workflows. To explore the solution space, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) search heuristic that simulates Darwinian natural selection by having members of a population compete to survive in order to pass their genetic chromosomes onto the next generation; after successive generations, there is a tendency for the chromosomes to converge toward the best combination [5] [6]. Although other search heuristics exist that can solve optimization problems (e.g. simulated annealing or steepest-ascent hillclimbing), the business process scheduling problem fits well with a GA because potential solutions can be represented in a matrix form and allows us to use prior research in effective GA chromosome recombination to form new members of the population (e.g. [2]). 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 1 Figure 2: An example chromosome representing a scheduling assignment of (workflow,service type) → service provider. Each row represents a workflow, and each column represents a service type. For example, here there are 3 workflows (0 to 2) and 5 service types (0 to 4). In workflow 0, any request for service type 3 goes to provider 2. Note that the service provider identifier is within a range limited to its service type (i.e. its column), so the 2 listed for service type 3 is a different server from server 2 in other columns. Chromosome representation of a solution. In Figure 2 we show an example chromosome that encodes one scheduling assignment. The representation is a 2-dimensional matrix that maps {workflow, service type} to a service provider. For a business process in workflow i and utilising service type j, the (i, j)th entry in the table is the identifier for the service provider to which the business process is assigned. Note that the service provider identifier is within a range limited to its service type. GA execution. A GA proceeds as follows. Initially a random set of chromosomes is created for the population. The chromosomes are evaluated (hashed) to some metric, and the best ones are chosen to be parents. In our problem, the evaluation produces the net business value across all workflows after executing all business processes once they are assigned to their respective service providers according to the mapping in the chromosome. The parents recombine to produce children, simulating sexual crossover, and occasionally a mutation may arise which produces new characteristics that were not available in either parent. The principal idea is that we would like the children to be different from the parents (in order to explore more of the solution space) yet not too different (in order to contain the portions of the chromosome that result in good scheduling assignments). Note that finding the global optimum is not guaranteed because the recombination and mutation are stochastic. GA recombination and mutation. As mentioned, the chromosomes are 2-dimensional matrices that represent scheduling assignments. To simulate sexual recombination of two chromosomes to produce a new child chromosome, we applied a one-point crossover scheme twice (once along each dimension). The crossover is best explained by analogy to Cartesian space as follows. A random point is chosen in the matrix to be coordinate (0, 0). Matrix elements from quadrants II and IV from the first parent and elements from quadrants I and III from the second parent are used to create the new child. This approach follows GA best practices by keeping contiguous chromosome segments together as they are transmitted from parent to child. The uni-chromosome mutation scheme randomly changes one of the service provider assignments to another provider within the available range. Other recombination and mutation schemes are an area of research in the GA community, and we look to explore new operators in future work. GA evaluation function. An important GA component is the evaluation function. Given a particular chromosome representing one scheduling mapping, the function deterministically calculates the net business value across all workloads. The business processes in each workload are assigned to service providers, and each providers completion time is calculated based on the service agreement guarantee using the parameters mentioned in Section 3.1, namely the unloaded completion time α, the maximum concur32 rency β, and a coefficient γ that controls the linear performance degradation under heavy load. Note that the evaluation function can be easily replaced if desired; for example, other evaluation functions can model different service provider guarantees or parallel workflows. 4. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS In this section we show the benefit of using our GA-based scheduler. Because we wanted to scale the scenarios up to a large number of workflows (up to 1000 in our experiments), we implemented a simulation program that allowed us to vary parameters and to measure the results with different metrics. The simulator was written in standard C++ and was run on a Linux (Fedora Core) desktop computer running at 2.8 GHz with 1GB of RAM. We compared our algorithm against alternative candidates: • A well-known round-robin algorithm that assigns each business process in circular fashion to the service providers for a particular service type. This approach provides the simplest scheme for load-balancing. • A random-proportional algorithm that proportionally assigns business processes to the service providers; that is, for a given service type, the service providers are ranked by their guaranteed completion time, and business processes are assigned proportionally to the providers based on their completion time. (We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former schemes results are shown here.) • A strawman greedy algorithm that always assigns business processes to the service provider that has the fastest guaranteed completion time. This algorithm represents a naive approach based on greedy, local observations of each workflow without taking into consideration all workflows. In the experiments that follow, all results were averaged across 20 trials, and to help normalise the effects of randomisation used during the GA, each trial started by reading in pre-initialised data from disk. In Table 1 we list our experimental parameters. In Figure 3 we show the results of running our GA against the three candidate alternatives. The x-axis shows the number for workflows scaled up to 1000, and the y-axis shows the aggregate business value for all workflows. As can be seen, the GA consistently produces the highest business value even as the number of workflows grows; at 1000 workflows, the GA produces a 115% improvement over the next-best alternative. (Note that although we are optimising against the business value metric we defined earlier, genetic algorithms are able to converge towards the optimal value of any metric, as long as the evaluation function can consistently measure a chromosomes value with that metric.) As expected, the greedy algorithm performs very poorly because it does the worst job at balancing load: all business processes for a given service type are assigned to only one server (the one advertised to have the fastest completion time), and as more business processes arrive, the providers performance degrades linearly. The round-robin scheme is initially outperformed by the randomproportional scheme up to around 120 workflows (as shown in the magnified graph of Figure 4), but as the number of workflows increases, the round-robin scheme consistently wins over randomproportional. The reason is that although the random-proportional scheme assigns business processes to providers proportionally according to the advertised completion times (which is a measure of the power of the service provider), even the best providers will eventually reach a real-world maximum concurrency for the large -2000 -1000 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Aggregatebusinessvalueacrossallworkflows Total number of workflows Business value scores of scheduling algorithms Genetic algorithm Round robin Random proportional Greedy Figure 3: Net business value scores of different scheduling algorithms. -500 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 0 50 100 150 200Aggregatebusinessvalueacrossallworkflows Total number of workflows Business value scores of scheduling algorithms Genetic algorithm Round robin Random proportional Greedy Figure 4: Magnification of the left-most region in Figure 3. number of workflows that we are considering. For a very large number of workflows, the round-robin scheme is able to better balance the load across all service providers. To better understand the behaviour resulting from the scheduling assignments, we show the workflow completion results in Figures 5, 6, and 7 for 100, 500, and 900 workflows, respectively. These figures show the percentage of workflows that are successful (can complete with their QoS limit), acceptable (can complete within κ=3 times their QoS limit), and failed (cannot complete within κ=3 times their QoS limit). The GA consistently produces the highest percentage of successful workflows (resulting in higher business values for the aggregate set of workflows). Further, the round-robin scheme produces better results than the random-proportional for a large number of workflows but does not perform as well as the GA. In Figure 8 we graph the makespan resulting from the same experiments above. Makespan is a traditional metric from the job scheduling community measuring elapsed time for the last job to complete. While useful, it does not capture the high-level business value metric that we are optimising against. Indeed, the makespan is oblivious to the fact that we provide multiple levels of completion (successful, acceptable, and failed) and assign business value scores accordingly. For completeness, we note that the GA provides the fastest makespan, but it is matched by the round robin algorithm. The GA produces better business values (as shown in Figure 3) because it is able to search the solution space to find better mappings that produce more successful workflows (as shown in Figures 5 to 7). We also looked at the effect of the scheduling algorithms on balancing the load. Figure 9 shows the percentage of services providers that were accessed while the workflows ran. As expected, the greedy algorithm always hits one service provider; on the other hand, the round-robin algorithm is the fastest to spread the business 33 Experimental parameter Comment Workflows 5 to 1000 Business processes per workflow uniform random: 1 - 10 Service types 10 Service providers per service type uniform random: 1 - 10 Workflow QoS goal uniform random: 10-30 seconds Service provider completion time (α) uniform random: 1 - 12 seconds Service provider maximum concurrency (β) uniform random: 1 - 12 Service provider degradation coefficient (γ) uniform random: 0.1 - 0.9 Business value for successful workflows uniform random: 10 - 50 points Business value for acceptable workflows uniform random: 0 - 10 points Business value for failed workflows uniform random: -10 - 0 points GA: number of parents 20 GA: number of children 80 GA: number of generations 1000 Table 1: Experimental parameters Failed Acceptable (completed but not within QoS) Successful (completed within QoS) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% RoundRobinRandProportionalGreedyGeneticAlg Percentageofallworkflows Workflow behaviour, 100 workflows Figure 5: Workflow behaviour for 100 workflows.

Figure 10 is the percentage of accessed service providers (that is, the percentage of service providers represented in Figure 9) that had more assigned business processes than their advertised maximum concurrency. For example, in the greedy algorithm only one service provider is utilised, and this one provider quickly becomes saturated. On the other hand, the random-proportional algorithm uses many service providers, but because business processes are proportionally assigned with more assignments going to the better providers, there is a tendency for a smaller percentage of providers to become saturated. For completeness, we show the performance of the genetic algorithm itself in Figure 11. The algorithm scales linearly with an increasing number of workflows. We note that the round-robin, random-proportional, and greedy algorithms all finished within 1 second even for the largest workflow configuration. However, we feel that the benefit of finding much higher business value scores justifies the running time of the GA; further we would expect that the running time will improve with both software tuning as well as with a computer faster than our off-the-shelf PC. 5. CONCLUSION Business processes within workflows can be orchestrated to access web services. In this paper we looked at multi-tiered service provisioning where web service requests to service types can be mapped to different service providers. The resulting problem is that in order to support a very large number of workflows, the assignment of business process to web service provider must be intelligent.

Since the solution space of scheduler mappings is exponential, we used a genetic search algorithm to search the space and converge toward the best schedule. With a default configuration for all parameters and using our business value scoring, the GA produced up to 115% business value improvement over the next best algorithm. Finally, because a genetic algorithm will converge towards the optimal value using any metric (even other than the business value metric we used), we believe our approach has strong potential for continuing work. In future work, we look to acquire real-world traces of web service instances in order to get better estimates of service agreement guarantees, although we expect that such guarantees between the providers and their consumers are not generally available to the public. We will also look at other QoS metrics such as CPU and I/O usage. For example, we can analyse transfer costs with varying bandwidth, latency, data size, and data distribution. Further, we hope to improve our genetic algorithm and compare it to more scheduler alternatives. Finally, since our work is complementary to existing work in web services choreography (because we rely on pre-configured workflows), we look to integrate our approach with available web service workflow systems expressed in BPEL. 6.

Introducción Los servicios web pueden componerse en flujos de trabajo para proporcionar funcionalidad optimizada de extremo a extremo para usuarios humanos u otros sistemas. Aunque los esfuerzos de investigación anteriores han buscado formas de automatizar de manera inteligente la composición de los servicios web en flujos de trabajo (por ejemplo, [1, 9]), un problema importante restante es la asignación de solicitudes de servicios web a los proveedores de servicios web subyacentes en un tiempo de ejecución de niveles múltiplesescenario dentro de las limitaciones. En este documento, abordamos este problema de programación y examinamos medios para administrar una gran cantidad de flujos de trabajo de procesos comerciales de manera escalable. El problema de programar las solicitudes de servicio web a los proveedores es relevante para los dominios comerciales modernos que dependen del aprovisionamiento de servicios de múltiples niveles. Considere el ejemplo que se muestra en la Figura 1 que ilustra nuestro espacio de problemas. Los flujos de trabajo comprenden múltiples procesos comerciales relacionados que son consumidores de servicios web;Aquí suponemos que los flujos de trabajo representan el servicio solicitado de clientes o sistemas automatizados y que el flujo de trabajo ya ha sido compuesto con un kit de herramientas de coreografía existente. Estos flujos de trabajo se envían a un portal (no se muestra) que actúa como agente de programación entre los consumidores de servicios web y los proveedores de servicios web. En este ejemplo, un flujo de trabajo podría representar las acciones necesarias para instanciar un itinerario de vacaciones, donde un proceso comercial solicita reservar un boleto de aerolínea, otro proceso de negocio solicita una habitación de hotel, etc. Cada una de estas solicitudes se dirige a un tipo de servicio particular (por ejemplo, reservas de aerolíneas, reservas de hoteles, reservas de automóviles, etc.), y para cada tipo de servicio, hay múltiples instancias de proveedores de servicios que publican una interfaz de servicio web. Un desafío importante es que los flujos de trabajo deben cumplir con una métrica de calidad de servicio (QoS), como el tiempo de finalización de extremo a extremo de todos sus procesos comerciales, y que cumplir o fallar este objetivo resulta en la asignación de un negocio cuantitativo.Valor métrico para el flujo de trabajo;Intuitivamente, se desea que todos los flujos de trabajo cumplan con sus respectivos objetivos de QoS. Además, aprovechamos la noción de que los acuerdos de servicio de QoS generalmente están acordados entre los proveedores de servicios web y el agente de programación de tal manera que los proveedores anuncian cierto nivel de QoS garantizado al planificador en función de condiciones de tiempo de ejecución, como el tiempo de respuesta y la máxima concurrencia disponible. El problema resultante es programar y asignar las solicitudes de procesos comerciales de tipos de servicio a uno de los proveedores de servicios para ese tipo. La programación debe hacerse de tal manera que se maximice el valor comercial agregado en todos los flujos de trabajo. En la Sección 3 declaramos el escenario como un problema combinatorio y utilizamos un algoritmo de búsqueda genética [5] para encontrar la mejor tarea de las solicitudes de servicio web a los proveedores. Este enfoque converge hacia una tarea que maximiza el valor comercial general para todos los flujos de trabajo. En la Sección 4 mostramos a través de la experimentación que esta búsqueda heurística encuentra mejores tareas que otros algoritmos (codicioso, redondo y proporcional). Además, este enfoque nos permite escalar el número de flujos de trabajo simultáneos (hasta mil flujos de trabajo en nuestros experimentos) y aún así encontrar horarios efectivos.2.

Las diferencias más destacadas son que las máquinas pueden procesar solo un trabajo a la vez (suponemos que los servidores pueden realizar múltiples tareas pero con rendimiento degradado y un nivel de concurrencia máximo), las tareas dentro de un trabajo no pueden ejecutarse simultáneamente en diferentes máquinas (asumimos que los procesos comerciales puedenser asignado a cualquier servidor disponible), y la métrica principal del rendimiento es el MakePan, que es el momento de la última tarea entre todos los trabajos para completar (y como mostramos más adelante, optimizar el makepan es insuficiente para programar los procesos comerciales, que requiere diferentes métricas).3. Diseñe en esta sección Describimos nuestro modelo y discutimos cómo podemos encontrar tareas de programación utilizando un algoritmo de búsqueda genética.3.1 Modelo Basamos nuestro modelo en el escenario simplificado que se muestra en la Figura 1. Específicamente, suponemos que los usuarios o los sistemas automatizados solicitan la ejecución de un flujo de trabajo. Los flujos de trabajo comprenden procesos comerciales, cada uno de los cuales hace que un servicio web se invocara a un tipo de servicio. Además, los procesos comerciales tienen un pedido en el flujo de trabajo. La disposición y la ejecución de los procesos comerciales y el flujo de datos entre ellos son administrados por una herramienta de composición o coreografía (por ejemplo, [1, 9]). Aunque los lenguajes de composición pueden usar mecanismos sofisticados de control de flujo, como las ramas condicionales, por simplicidad suponemos que los procesos se ejecutan secuencialmente en un orden dado. Este escenario puede extenderse naturalmente a relaciones más complejas que se pueden expresar en BPEL [7], lo que define cómo interactúan los procesos comerciales, se intercambian mensajes, se ordenan actividades y se manejan excepciones. Debido a las limitaciones de espacio, nos centramos en el problema del espacio presentado aquí y ampliaremos nuestro modelo a escenarios de implementación más avanzados en el futuro. Cada flujo de trabajo tiene un requisito de QoS para completar dentro de un número específico de unidades de tiempo (por ejemplo, en el orden de segundos, como se detalla en la sección Experimentos). Al finalizar (o falla), al flujo de trabajo se le asigna un valor comercial. Extendimos este enfoque aún más y consideramos diferentes tipos de finalización del flujo de trabajo para modelar niveles de QoS diferenciados que pueden aplicar las empresas (por ejemplo, para proporcionar un servicio al cliente escalonado). Decimos que un flujo de trabajo es exitoso si se completa dentro de su requisito de QoS, aceptable si se completa dentro de un factor constante κ 31 de su límite de QoS (en nuestros experimentos elegimos κ = 3), o falla si termina más allá de κ veces su QoS su QoSatado. Para cada categoría, se asigna un puntaje de valor comercial al flujo de trabajo, con la categoría exitosa asignada el puntaje positivo más alto, seguido de aceptable y luego falla. La distribución del punto de valor comercial no es uniforme entre los flujos de trabajo, más casos de modelado en los que algunos flujos de trabajo son de mayor prioridad que otros. Cada tipo de servicio es implementado por varios proveedores de servicios diferentes. Suponemos que los proveedores hacen acuerdos de nivel de servicio (SLA) para garantizar un nivel de rendimiento definido por el tiempo de finalización para completar una invocación del servicio web. Aunque los SLA pueden ser complejos, en este documento suponemos por simplicidad que las garantías pueden tomar la forma de una degradación de rendimiento lineal bajo carga. Esta garantía se define por varios parámetros: α es el tiempo de finalización esperado (por ejemplo, en el orden de segundos) si la carga de trabajo asignada de las solicitudes de servicio web es menor o igual a β, la concurrencia máxima y si la carga de trabajo es más altaque β, la finalización esperada para una carga de trabajo de tamaño Ω es α+ γ (Ω - β) donde γ es un coeficiente fraccional. En nuestros experimentos variamos α, β y γ con diferentes distribuciones. Idealmente, todos los flujos de trabajo podrían terminar dentro de sus límites de QoS y, por lo tanto, maximizar el valor comercial agregado en todos los flujos de trabajo. Sin embargo, debido a que modelamos a los proveedores de servicios con rendimiento degradante bajo carga, no todos los flujos de trabajo alcanzarán su límite de QoS: puede ser fácilmente el caso de que los procesos comerciales se asignen a los proveedores que están sobrecargados y no pueden completarse dentro del límite de QoS de flujos de trabajo respectivos. El problema de investigación clave, entonces, es asignar los procesos comerciales a los proveedores de servicios web con el objetivo de optimizar el valor comercial agregado de todos los flujos de trabajo. Dado que el alcance de la optimización es el conjunto completo de flujos de trabajo, puede ser que las mejores tareas de programación puedan dar lugar a que algunos flujos de trabajo tengan que fallar para que más flujos de trabajo tengan éxito. Esta observación intuitiva sugiere que los enfoques de programación tradicionales como la redonda o las tareas proporcionales no funcionarán bien, que es lo que observamos y discutimos en la Sección 4. Por otro lado, una búsqueda exhaustiva de todas las tareas posibles encontrará el mejor horario, pero la complejidad computacional es prohibitivamente alta. Supongamos que hay flujos de trabajo W con un promedio de procesos comerciales B por flujo de trabajo. Además, en el peor de los casos, cada proceso comercial solicita un tipo de servicio, para el cual hay proveedores de P. Por lo tanto, hay combinaciones de W · PB para explorar para encontrar las tareas óptimas de los procesos comerciales para los proveedores. Incluso para configuraciones pequeñas (p. Ej. W = 10, b = 5, p = 10), el tiempo computacional para la búsqueda exhaustiva es significativo, y en nuestro trabajo buscamos escalar estos parámetros. En la siguiente subsección, discuta cómo se puede utilizar un algoritmo de búsqueda genética para converger hacia las tareas de programación óptimas.3.2 Algoritmo genético Dado un espacio de búsqueda exponencial de asignaciones de procesos comerciales para proveedores de servicios web, el problema es encontrar la tarea óptima que produce el valor comercial agregado general más alto en todos los flujos de trabajo. Para explorar el espacio de la solución, utilizamos una heurística de búsqueda del algoritmo genético (GA) que simula la selección natural darwiniana al hacer que los miembros de una población compitan para sobrevivir para pasar sus cromosomas genéticos a la próxima generación;Después de generaciones sucesivas, existe una tendencia a que los cromosomas converjan hacia la mejor combinación [5] [6]. Aunque existen otras heurísticas de búsqueda que pueden resolver los problemas de optimización (por ejemplo, recocido simulado o esculpido de hilos más empinado), el problema de programación de procesos comerciales se ajusta bien a una GA porque las soluciones potenciales pueden representarse en forma de matriz y nos permite usar investigaciones previas en efectivo en efectivoRecombinación cromosómica GA para formar nuevos miembros de la población (por ejemplo [2]).0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 1 Figura 2: Un cromosoma de ejemplo que representa una asignación de programación de (flujo de trabajo, tipo de servicio) → proveedor de servicios. Cada fila representa un flujo de trabajo, y cada columna representa un tipo de servicio. Por ejemplo, aquí hay 3 flujos de trabajo (0 a 2) y 5 tipos de servicio (0 a 4). En Workflow 0, cualquier solicitud de servicio tipo 3 va al proveedor 2. Tenga en cuenta que el identificador del proveedor de servicios está dentro de un rango limitado a su tipo de servicio (es decir, su columna), por lo que los 2 enumerados para el tipo de servicio 3 son un servidor diferente del servidor 2 en otras columnas. Representación cromosómica de una solución. En la Figura 2 mostramos un cromosoma de ejemplo que codifica una asignación de programación. La representación es una matriz bidimensional que mapea {flujo de trabajo, tipo de servicio} a un proveedor de servicios. Para un proceso comercial en el flujo de trabajo I y utilizando el tipo de servicio J, la (i, j) la entrada en la tabla es el identificador para el proveedor de servicios al que se asigna el proceso comercial. Tenga en cuenta que el identificador del proveedor de servicios está dentro de un rango limitado a su tipo de servicio. Ejecución de GA. Un GA procede de la siguiente manera. Inicialmente, se crea un conjunto aleatorio de cromosomas para la población. Los cromosomas se evalúan (hash) a alguna métrica, y los mejores se eligen para ser padres. En nuestro problema, la evaluación produce el valor comercial neto en todos los flujos de trabajo después de ejecutar todos los procesos comerciales una vez que se asignan a sus respectivos proveedores de servicios de acuerdo con el mapeo en el cromosoma. Los padres se recombinan para producir hijos, simulando el crossover sexual y ocasionalmente puede surgir una mutación que produce nuevas características que no estaban disponibles en ninguno de los padres. La idea principal es que nos gustaría que los niños sean diferentes de los padres (para explorar más espacio en la solución) pero no muy diferentes (para contener las porciones del cromosoma que resultan en buenas tareas de programación). Tenga en cuenta que encontrar el óptimo global no está garantizado porque la recombinación y la mutación son estocásticas. Recombinación y mutación de GA. Como se mencionó, los cromosomas son matrices bidimensionales que representan asignaciones de programación. Para simular la recombinación sexual de dos cromosomas para producir un nuevo cromosoma infantil, aplicamos un esquema de cruce de un punto dos veces (una vez a lo largo de cada dimensión). El crossover se explica mejor por analogía al espacio cartesiano de la siguiente manera. Se elige un punto aleatorio en la matriz para ser coordinada (0, 0). Los elementos de matriz de los cuadrantes II y IV del primer padre y los elementos de los cuadrantes I y III del segundo padre se utilizan para crear el nuevo hijo. Este enfoque sigue las mejores prácticas de GA manteniendo juntos segmentos de cromosomas contiguos a medida que se transmiten de padre a niño. El esquema de mutación uni-cromosoma cambia aleatoriamente una de las asignaciones de proveedores de servicios a otro proveedor dentro del rango disponible. Otros esquemas de recombinación y mutación son un área de investigación en la comunidad de GA, y buscamos explorar nuevos operadores en el trabajo futuro. Función de evaluación de GA. Un componente de GA importante es la función de evaluación. Dado un cromosoma particular que representa un mapeo de programación, la función calcula determinista el valor comercial neto en todas las cargas de trabajo. Los procesos comerciales en cada carga de trabajo se asignan a los proveedores de servicios, y el tiempo de finalización de cada proveedor se calcula en función de la garantía de acuerdo de servicio utilizando los parámetros mencionados en la Sección 3.1, a saber, el tiempo de finalización descargado α, la rencia β de la rentabilidad máxima y un coeficiente γ coeficienteEso controla la degradación del rendimiento lineal bajo carga pesada. Tenga en cuenta que la función de evaluación se puede reemplazar fácilmente si lo desea;Por ejemplo, otras funciones de evaluación pueden modelar diferentes garantías de proveedores de servicios o flujos de trabajo paralelos.4. Experimentos y resultados En esta sección mostramos el beneficio de usar nuestro planificador basado en GA. Debido a que queríamos escalar los escenarios hasta una gran cantidad de flujos de trabajo (hasta 1000 en nuestros experimentos), implementamos un programa de simulación que nos permitió variar parámetros y medir los resultados con diferentes métricas. El simulador se escribió en C ++ estándar y se ejecutó en una computadora de escritorio Linux (Fedora Core) que se ejecuta a 2.8 GHz con 1 GB de RAM. Comparamos nuestro algoritmo con candidatos alternativos: • Un algoritmo bien conocido de Round-Robin que asigna cada proceso comercial de manera circular a los proveedores de servicios para un tipo de servicio particular. Este enfoque proporciona el esquema más simple para el equilibrio de carga.• un algoritmo de proporción aleatoria que asigna proporcionalmente procesos comerciales a los proveedores de servicios;Es decir, para un tipo de servicio determinado, los proveedores de servicios están clasificados por su tiempo de finalización garantizado, y los procesos comerciales se asignan proporcionalmente a los proveedores en función de su tiempo de finalización.(También probamos un esquema de proporcionalidad basado tanto en los tiempos de finalización como en la concurrencia máxima, pero logramos los mismos resultados, por lo que solo los resultados de los esquemas anteriores se muestran aquí.) • Un algoritmo codicioso de Strawman que siempre asigna procesos comerciales al proveedor de servicios que tiene elTiempo de finalización garantizado más rápido. Este algoritmo representa un enfoque ingenuo basado en observaciones locales codiciosas de cada flujo de trabajo sin tener en cuenta todos los flujos de trabajo. En los experimentos que siguen, todos los resultados se promediaron en 20 ensayos y para ayudar a normalizar los efectos de la aleatorización utilizada durante la GA, cada ensayo comenzó leyendo en datos preinicializados del disco. En la Tabla 1 enumeramos nuestros parámetros experimentales. En la Figura 3 mostramos los resultados de ejecutar nuestro GA contra las tres alternativas candidatas. El eje X muestra el número de flujos de trabajo escalados hasta 1000, y el eje Y muestra el valor comercial agregado para todos los flujos de trabajo. Como se puede ver, la GA produce constantemente el mayor valor comercial, incluso a medida que crece el número de flujos de trabajo;Con 1000 flujos de trabajo, el GA produce una mejora del 115% sobre la siguiente alternativa.(Tenga en cuenta que aunque estamos optimizando con la métrica de valor comercial que definimos anteriormente, los algoritmos genéticos pueden converger hacia el valor óptimo de cualquier métrica, siempre que la función de evaluación pueda medir consistentemente un valor de cromosomas con esa métrica). Como se esperaba, el algoritmo codicioso funciona muy mal porque hace el peor trabajo al equilibrar la carga: todos los procesos comerciales para un tipo de servicio determinado se asignan a un solo servidor (el anunciado para tener el tiempo de finalización más rápido) y como más procesos comercialesLlega, el rendimiento del proveedor se degrada linealmente. El esquema redondo de robín inicialmente es superado por el esquema aleatorio de forma proporcional hasta alrededor de 120 flujos de trabajo (como se muestra en el gráfico ampliado de la Figura 4), pero a medida que aumenta el número de flujos de trabajo, el esquema de round-roBin gana consistentemente sobre la proporción aleatoria. La razón es que aunque el esquema de proporción aleatoria asigna procesos comerciales a los proveedores proporcionalmente de acuerdo con los tiempos de finalización anunciados (que es una medida del poder del proveedor de servicios), incluso los mejores proveedores eventualmente alcanzarán una concurrencia máxima del mundo real paraEl gran -2000 -1000 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 0 200 400 600 800 1000 AggregateBusinessValueArsAlsallWorkwork Flows Número total de flujos de trabajo de flujos de trabajo puntajes de valor comercial de algoritmos de algoritmo genético Round Round Round Round Proportionalmente Figura 3: Pulinos de valor comercial neto de los diferentes algoritmos de programación.-500 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 0 50 100 150 200AggregateBusiness ValueAcrossallWorkflows Número total de flujos de trabajo Puntuaciones de valor comercial de los algoritmos de programación Algoritmo genético Round Robin Robin Camediario Figura 4: Aumento de la región más izquierda en la Figura 3. Número de flotas de trabajo Fultos de trabajoque estamos considerando. Para una gran cantidad de flujos de trabajo, el esquema de redondeo puede equilibrar mejor la carga en todos los proveedores de servicios. Para comprender mejor el comportamiento resultante de las tareas de programación, mostramos los resultados de finalización del flujo de trabajo en las Figuras 5, 6 y 7 para los flujos de trabajo de 100, 500 y 900, respectivamente. Estas cifras muestran el porcentaje de flujos de trabajo que tienen éxito (pueden completarse con su límite de QoS), aceptables (pueden completarse dentro de κ = 3 veces su límite de QoS) y fallidos (no se puede completar dentro de κ = 3 veces su límite de QoS). La GA produce constantemente el mayor porcentaje de flujos de trabajo exitosos (lo que resulta en valores comerciales más altos para el conjunto de flujos de trabajo agregados). Además, el esquema de round-robin produce mejores resultados que el proporsional aleatorio para una gran cantidad de flujos de trabajo, pero no funciona tan bien como la GA. En la Figura 8 graficamos el MakePan resultante de los mismos experimentos anteriores. MakePan es una métrica tradicional de la comunidad de programación de empleo que mide el tiempo transcurrido para que el último trabajo complete. Si bien es útil, no captura la métrica de valor comercial de alto nivel con la que estamos optimizando. De hecho, el Makepan es ajeno al hecho de que proporcionamos múltiples niveles de finalización (exitosos, aceptables y fallidos) y asigna puntajes de valor comercial en consecuencia. Para completar, observamos que la GA proporciona el Makepan más rápido, pero el algoritmo Round Robin lo coincide. El GA produce mejores valores comerciales (como se muestra en la Figura 3) porque es capaz de buscar el espacio de la solución para encontrar mejores asignaciones que produzcan flujos de trabajo más exitosos (como se muestra en las Figuras 5 a 7). También observamos el efecto de los algoritmos de programación al equilibrar la carga. La Figura 9 muestra el porcentaje de proveedores de servicios a los que se accedió mientras se ejecutaban los flujos de trabajo. Como se esperaba, el algoritmo codicioso siempre llega a un proveedor de servicios;Por otro lado, el algoritmo de remolino redondo es el más rápido para difundir el negocio 33 FLUILES DE TRABAJO DEL COMENTARIO DEL COMENTARIO EXPERIMENTAL 5 a 1000 por flujo de trabajo Uniforme Aleatorio: 1 - 10 Tipos de servicio 10 Proveedores de servicios por tipo de servicio Uniforme aleatorio: 1 - 10 WorkflowQOS Objetivo Uniforme aleatorio: 10-30 segundos Tiempo de finalización del proveedor de servicios (α) Uniforme aleatorio: 1 - 12 segundos Proveedor de servicios Máxima concurrencia (β) uniforme aleatorio: 1 - 12 Proveedor de servicios Coeficiente de degradación (γ) uniforme: 0.1 - 0.9 comercialValor para flujos de trabajo exitosos uniformes aleatorios: 10 - 50 puntos Valor comercial para flujos de trabajo aceptables Uniformes aleatorios: 0 - 10 puntos Valor comercial para flujos de trabajo fallidos Uniformes aleatorios: -10 - 0 puntos GA: Número de padres 20 Ga: Número de niños 80 Ga:Número de generaciones 1000 Tabla 1: Los parámetros experimentales fallaron aceptables (completados pero no dentro de QoS) exitoso (completado dentro de QoS) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% RoundRandProportionAlgreedyGeneticG porcentaje de flujo de flujo de flujo de flujo de flujo de trabajo, 100 flujos de trabajo Figura 5: Comportamiento de flujo de trabajo para 100flujos de trabajo.

La Figura 10 es el porcentaje de proveedores de servicios accedidos (es decir, el porcentaje de proveedores de servicios representados en la Figura 9) que tenían más procesos comerciales asignados que su concurrencia máxima anunciada. Por ejemplo, en el algoritmo codicioso solo se utiliza un proveedor de servicios, y este proveedor se satura rápidamente. Por otro lado, el algoritmo de proporción aleatoria utiliza muchos proveedores de servicios, pero debido a que los procesos comerciales se asignan proporcionalmente con más tareas que van a los mejores proveedores, existe una tendencia a que un porcentaje menor de proveedores se sature. Para completar, mostramos el rendimiento del algoritmo genético en sí en la Figura 11. El algoritmo escala linealmente con un número creciente de flujos de trabajo. Observamos que los algoritmos redondos de robín, proporción aleatoria y codicioso terminados en 1 segundo incluso para la mayor configuración de flujo de trabajo. Sin embargo, creemos que el beneficio de encontrar puntajes de valor comercial mucho más altos justifica el tiempo de ejecución de la GA;Además, esperaríamos que el tiempo de ejecución mejore con el ajuste del software, así como con una computadora más rápido que nuestra PC estándar.5. Conclusión Los procesos comerciales dentro de los flujos de trabajo pueden orquestarse para acceder a los servicios web. En este documento, analizamos el aprovisionamiento de servicios de múltiples niveles, donde las solicitudes de servicio web a los tipos de servicios se pueden asignar a diferentes proveedores de servicios. El problema resultante es que para admitir una gran cantidad de flujos de trabajo, la asignación del proceso comercial al proveedor de servicios web debe ser inteligente.

Dado que el espacio de solución de las asignaciones de programador es exponencial, utilizamos un algoritmo de búsqueda genética para buscar el espacio y converger hacia el mejor horario. Con una configuración predeterminada para todos los parámetros y el uso de nuestra puntuación de valor comercial, la GA produjo una mejora del valor comercial de hasta 115% en el siguiente algoritmo mejor. Finalmente, debido a que un algoritmo genético convergerá hacia el valor óptimo utilizando cualquier métrica (incluso otra cosa que la métrica de valor comercial que utilizamos), creemos que nuestro enfoque tiene un fuerte potencial para continuar el trabajo. En el trabajo futuro, buscamos adquirir rastros del mundo real de las instancias de servicio web para obtener mejores estimaciones de las garantías de acuerdo de servicio, aunque esperamos que tales garantías entre los proveedores y sus consumidores no estén generalmente disponibles para el público. También veremos otras métricas de QoS, como la CPU y el uso de E/S. Por ejemplo, podemos analizar los costos de transferencia con ancho de banda variable, latencia, tamaño de datos y distribución de datos. Además, esperamos mejorar nuestro algoritmo genético y compararlo con más alternativas de programador. Finalmente, dado que nuestro trabajo es complementario al trabajo existente en la coreografía de servicios web (porque confiamos en los flujos de trabajo preconfigurados), buscamos integrar nuestro enfoque con los sistemas de flujo de trabajo de servicios web disponibles expresados en BPEL.6.

        "DESIGN In this section we describe our model and discuss how we can find scheduling assignments using a genetic search algorithm. 3.1 Model We base our model on the simplified scenario shown in Figure 1.",
        "Specifically, we assume that users or automated systems request the execution of a workflow.",
        "The workflows comprise business processes, each of which makes one web service invocation to a service type.",
        "Further, business processes have an ordering in the workflow.",
        "The arrangement and execution of the business processes and the data flow between them are all managed by a composition or choreography tool (e.g. [1, 9]).",
        "Although composition languages can use sophisticated flow-control mechanisms such as conditional branches, for simplicity we assume the processes execute sequentially in a given order.",
        "This scenario can be naturally extended to more complex relationships that can be expressed in BPEL [7], which defines how business processes interact, messages are exchanged, activities are ordered, and exceptions are handled.",
        "Due to space constraints, we focus on the problem space presented here and will extend our model to more advanced deployment scenarios in the future.",
        "Each workflow has a QoS requirement to complete within a specified number of time units (e.g. on the order of seconds, as detailed in the Experiments section).",
        "Upon completion (or failure), the workflow is assigned a business value.",
        "We extended this approach further and considered different types of workflow completion in order to model differentiated QoS levels that can be applied by businesses (for example, to provide tiered customer service).",
        "We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement, acceptable if it completes within a constant factor κ 31 of its QoS bound (in our experiments we chose κ=3), or failing if it finishes beyond κ times its QoS bound.",
        "For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing.",
        "The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others.",
        "Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers.",
        "We assume that the providers make service level agreements (SLAs) to guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a web service invocation.",
        "Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load.",
        "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",
        "In our experiments we vary α, β, and γ with different distributions.",
        "Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows.",
        "However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit.",
        "The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.",
        "Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows, it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed.",
        "This intuitive observation suggests that traditional scheduling approaches such as round-robin or proportional assignments will not fare well, which is what we observe and discuss in Section 4.",
        "On the other hand, an exhaustive search of all the possible assignments will find the best schedule, but the computational complexity is prohibitively high.",
        "Suppose there are W workflows with an average of B business processes per workflow.",
        "Further, in the worst case each business process requests one service type, for which there are P providers.",
        "There are thus W · PB combinations to explore to find the optimal assignments of business processes to providers.",
        "Even for small configurations (e.g.",
        "W =10, B=5, P=10), the computational time for exhaustive search is significant, and in our work we look to scale these parameters.",
        "In the next subsection, discuss how a genetic search algorithm can be used to converge toward the optimum scheduling assignments. 3.2 Genetic algorithm Given an exponential search space of business process assignments to web service providers, the problem is to find the optimal assignment that produces the overall highest aggregate business value across all workflows.",
        "To explore the solution space, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) search heuristic that simulates Darwinian natural selection by having members of a population compete to survive in order to pass their genetic chromosomes onto the next generation; after successive generations, there is a tendency for the chromosomes to converge toward the best combination [5] [6].",
        "Although other search heuristics exist that can solve optimization problems (e.g. simulated annealing or steepest-ascent hillclimbing), the business process scheduling problem fits well with a GA because potential solutions can be represented in a matrix form and allows us to use prior research in effective GA chromosome recombination to form new members of the population (e.g. [2]). 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 1 Figure 2: An example chromosome representing a scheduling assignment of (workflow,service type) → service provider.",
        "Each row represents a workflow, and each column represents a service type.",
        "For example, here there are 3 workflows (0 to 2) and 5 service types (0 to 4).",
        "In workflow 0, any request for service type 3 goes to provider 2.",
        "Note that the service provider identifier is within a range limited to its service type (i.e. its column), so the 2 listed for service type 3 is a different server from server 2 in other columns.",
        "Chromosome representation of a solution.",
        "In Figure 2 we show an example chromosome that encodes one scheduling assignment.",
        "The representation is a 2-dimensional matrix that maps {workflow, service type} to a service provider.",
        "For a business process in workflow i and utilising service type j, the (i, j)th entry in the table is the identifier for the service provider to which the business process is assigned.",
        "Note that the service provider identifier is within a range limited to its service type.",
        "GA execution.",
        "A GA proceeds as follows.",
        "Initially a random set of chromosomes is created for the population.",
        "The chromosomes are evaluated (hashed) to some metric, and the best ones are chosen to be parents.",
        "In our problem, the evaluation produces the net business value across all workflows after executing all business processes once they are assigned to their respective service providers according to the mapping in the chromosome.",
        "The parents recombine to produce children, simulating sexual crossover, and occasionally a mutation may arise which produces new characteristics that were not available in either parent.",
        "The principal idea is that we would like the children to be different from the parents (in order to explore more of the solution space) yet not too different (in order to contain the portions of the chromosome that result in good scheduling assignments).",
        "Note that finding the global optimum is not guaranteed because the recombination and mutation are stochastic.",
        "GA recombination and mutation.",
        "As mentioned, the chromosomes are 2-dimensional matrices that represent scheduling assignments.",
        "To simulate sexual recombination of two chromosomes to produce a new child chromosome, we applied a one-point crossover scheme twice (once along each dimension).",
        "The crossover is best explained by analogy to Cartesian space as follows.",
        "A random point is chosen in the matrix to be coordinate (0, 0).",
        "Matrix elements from quadrants II and IV from the first parent and elements from quadrants I and III from the second parent are used to create the new child.",
        "This approach follows GA best practices by keeping contiguous chromosome segments together as they are transmitted from parent to child.",
        "The uni-chromosome mutation scheme randomly changes one of the service provider assignments to another provider within the available range.",
        "Other recombination and mutation schemes are an area of research in the GA community, and we look to explore new operators in future work.",
        "GA evaluation function.",
        "An important GA component is the evaluation function.",
        "Given a particular chromosome representing one scheduling mapping, the function deterministically calculates the net business value across all workloads.",
        "The business processes in each workload are assigned to service providers, and each providers completion time is calculated based on the service agreement guarantee using the parameters mentioned in Section 3.1, namely the unloaded completion time α, the maximum concur32 rency β, and a coefficient γ that controls the linear performance degradation under heavy load.",
        "Note that the evaluation function can be easily replaced if desired; for example, other evaluation functions can model different service provider guarantees or parallel workflows. 4.",
        "EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS In this section we show the benefit of using our GA-based scheduler.",
        "Because we wanted to scale the scenarios up to a large number of workflows (up to 1000 in our experiments), we implemented a simulation program that allowed us to vary parameters and to measure the results with different metrics.",
        "The simulator was written in standard C++ and was run on a Linux (Fedora Core) desktop computer running at 2.8 GHz with 1GB of RAM.",
        "We compared our algorithm against alternative candidates: • A well-known round-robin algorithm that assigns each business process in circular fashion to the service providers for a particular service type.",
        "This approach provides the simplest scheme for load-balancing. • A random-proportional algorithm that proportionally assigns business processes to the service providers; that is, for a given service type, the service providers are ranked by their guaranteed completion time, and business processes are assigned proportionally to the providers based on their completion time. (We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former schemes results are shown here.) • A strawman greedy algorithm that always assigns business processes to the service provider that has the fastest guaranteed completion time.",
        "This algorithm represents a naive approach based on greedy, local observations of each workflow without taking into consideration all workflows.",
        "In the experiments that follow, all results were averaged across 20 trials, and to help normalise the effects of randomisation used during the GA, each trial started by reading in pre-initialised data from disk.",
        "In Table 1 we list our experimental parameters.",
        "In Figure 3 we show the results of running our GA against the three candidate alternatives.",
        "The x-axis shows the number for workflows scaled up to 1000, and the y-axis shows the aggregate business value for all workflows.",
        "As can be seen, the GA consistently produces the highest business value even as the number of workflows grows; at 1000 workflows, the GA produces a 115% improvement over the next-best alternative. (Note that although we are optimising against the business value metric we defined earlier, genetic algorithms are able to converge towards the optimal value of any metric, as long as the evaluation function can consistently measure a chromosomes value with that metric.)",
        "As expected, the greedy algorithm performs very poorly because it does the worst job at balancing load: all business processes for a given service type are assigned to only one server (the one advertised to have the fastest completion time), and as more business processes arrive, the providers performance degrades linearly.",
        "The round-robin scheme is initially outperformed by the randomproportional scheme up to around 120 workflows (as shown in the magnified graph of Figure 4), but as the number of workflows increases, the round-robin scheme consistently wins over randomproportional.",
        "The reason is that although the random-proportional scheme assigns business processes to providers proportionally according to the advertised completion times (which is a measure of the power of the service provider), even the best providers will eventually reach a real-world maximum concurrency for the large -2000 -1000 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Aggregatebusinessvalueacrossallworkflows Total number of workflows Business value scores of scheduling algorithms Genetic algorithm Round robin Random proportional Greedy Figure 3: Net business value scores of different scheduling algorithms. -500 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 0 50 100 150 200Aggregatebusinessvalueacrossallworkflows Total number of workflows Business value scores of scheduling algorithms Genetic algorithm Round robin Random proportional Greedy Figure 4: Magnification of the left-most region in Figure 3. number of workflows that we are considering.",
        "For a very large number of workflows, the round-robin scheme is able to better balance the load across all service providers.",
        "To better understand the behaviour resulting from the scheduling assignments, we show the workflow completion results in Figures 5, 6, and 7 for 100, 500, and 900 workflows, respectively.",
        "These figures show the percentage of workflows that are successful (can complete with their QoS limit), acceptable (can complete within κ=3 times their QoS limit), and failed (cannot complete within κ=3 times their QoS limit).",
        "The GA consistently produces the highest percentage of successful workflows (resulting in higher business values for the aggregate set of workflows).",
        "Further, the round-robin scheme produces better results than the random-proportional for a large number of workflows but does not perform as well as the GA.",
        "In Figure 8 we graph the makespan resulting from the same experiments above.",
        "Makespan is a traditional metric from the job scheduling community measuring elapsed time for the last job to complete.",
        "While useful, it does not capture the high-level business value metric that we are optimising against.",
        "Indeed, the makespan is oblivious to the fact that we provide multiple levels of completion (successful, acceptable, and failed) and assign business value scores accordingly.",
        "For completeness, we note that the GA provides the fastest makespan, but it is matched by the round robin algorithm.",
        "The GA produces better business values (as shown in Figure 3) because it is able to search the solution space to find better mappings that produce more successful workflows (as shown in Figures 5 to 7).",

        "On the other hand, the random-proportional algorithm uses many service providers, but because business processes are proportionally assigned with more assignments going to the better providers, there is a tendency for a smaller percentage of providers to become saturated.",

        "The algorithm scales linearly with an increasing number of workflows.",
        "We note that the round-robin, random-proportional, and greedy algorithms all finished within 1 second even for the largest workflow configuration.",

        "Since the solution space of scheduler mappings is exponential, we used a genetic search algorithm to search the space and converge toward the best schedule.",
        "With a default configuration for all parameters and using our business value scoring, the GA produced up to 115% business value improvement over the next best algorithm.",
        "Finally, because a genetic algorithm will converge towards the optimal value using any metric (even other than the business value metric we used), we believe our approach has strong potential for continuing work.",
        "In future work, we look to acquire real-world traces of web service instances in order to get better estimates of service agreement guarantees, although we expect that such guarantees between the providers and their consumers are not generally available to the public.",

                "We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the web service providers and the scheduling agent such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency.",

                "Our work also builds upon prior scheduling research.",
                "The classic job-shop scheduling problem, shown to be NP-complete [4] [3], is similar to ours in that tasks within a job must be scheduled onto machinery (c.f. our scenario is that business processes within a workflow must be scheduled onto web service providers).",
                "The salient differences are that the machines can process only one job at a time (we assume servers can multi-task but with degraded performance and a maximum concurrency level), tasks within a job cannot simultaneously run on different machines (we assume business processes can be assigned to any available server), and the principal metric of performance is the makespan, which is the time for the last task among all the jobs to complete (and as we show later, optimising on the makespan is insufficient for scheduling the business processes, necessitating different metrics). 3.",
                "DESIGN In this section we describe our model and discuss how we can find scheduling assignments using a genetic search algorithm. 3.1 Model We base our model on the simplified scenario shown in Figure 1.",
                "Specifically, we assume that users or automated systems request the execution of a workflow.",
                "The workflows comprise business processes, each of which makes one web service invocation to a service type.",
                "Further, business processes have an ordering in the workflow.",
                "The arrangement and execution of the business processes and the data flow between them are all managed by a composition or choreography tool (e.g. [1, 9]).",
                "Although composition languages can use sophisticated flow-control mechanisms such as conditional branches, for simplicity we assume the processes execute sequentially in a given order.",
                "This scenario can be naturally extended to more complex relationships that can be expressed in BPEL [7], which defines how business processes interact, messages are exchanged, activities are ordered, and exceptions are handled.",
                "Due to space constraints, we focus on the problem space presented here and will extend our model to more advanced deployment scenarios in the future.",
                "Each workflow has a QoS requirement to complete within a specified number of time units (e.g. on the order of seconds, as detailed in the Experiments section).",
                "Upon completion (or failure), the workflow is assigned a business value.",
                "We extended this approach further and considered different types of workflow completion in order to model differentiated QoS levels that can be applied by businesses (for example, to provide tiered customer service).",
                "We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement, acceptable if it completes within a constant factor κ 31 of its QoS bound (in our experiments we chose κ=3), or failing if it finishes beyond κ times its QoS bound.",
                "For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing.",
                "The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others.",
                "Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers.",
                "We assume that the providers make service level agreements (SLAs) to guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a web service invocation.",
                "Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load.",
                "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",
                "In our experiments we vary α, β, and γ with different distributions.",
                "Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit.",
                "The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.",
                "Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows, it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed.",
                "This intuitive observation suggests that traditional scheduling approaches such as round-robin or proportional assignments will not fare well, which is what we observe and discuss in Section 4.",
                "On the other hand, an exhaustive search of all the possible assignments will find the best schedule, but the computational complexity is prohibitively high.",
                "Suppose there are W workflows with an average of B business processes per workflow.",
                "Further, in the worst case each business process requests one service type, for which there are P providers.",
                "There are thus W · PB combinations to explore to find the optimal assignments of business processes to providers.",
                "Even for small configurations (e.g.",
                "W =10, B=5, P=10), the computational time for exhaustive search is significant, and in our work we look to scale these parameters.",
                "In the next subsection, discuss how a genetic search algorithm can be used to converge toward the optimum scheduling assignments. 3.2 Genetic algorithm Given an exponential search space of business process assignments to web service providers, the problem is to find the optimal assignment that produces the overall highest aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "To explore the solution space, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) search heuristic that simulates Darwinian natural selection by having members of a population compete to survive in order to pass their genetic chromosomes onto the next generation; after successive generations, there is a tendency for the chromosomes to converge toward the best combination [5] [6].",
                "Although other search heuristics exist that can solve optimization problems (e.g. simulated annealing or steepest-ascent hillclimbing), the business process scheduling problem fits well with a GA because potential solutions can be represented in a matrix form and allows us to use prior research in effective GA chromosome recombination to form new members of the population (e.g. [2]). 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 1 Figure 2: An example chromosome representing a scheduling assignment of (workflow,service type) → service provider.",

                "The principal idea is that we would like the children to be different from the parents (in order to explore more of the solution space) yet not too different (in order to contain the portions of the chromosome that result in good scheduling assignments).",

                "Because we wanted to scale the scenarios up to a large number of workflows (up to 1000 in our experiments), we implemented a simulation program that allowed us to vary parameters and to measure the results with different metrics.",

(We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former schemes results are shown here.) • A strawman greedy algorithm that always assigns business processes to the service provider that has the fastest guaranteed completion time.",
                "This algorithm represents a naive approach based on greedy, local observations of each workflow without taking into consideration all workflows.",
                "In the experiments that follow, all results were averaged across 20 trials, and to help normalise the effects of randomisation used during the GA, each trial started by reading in pre-initialised data from disk.",

                "As can be seen, the GA consistently produces the highest business value even as the number of workflows grows; at 1000 workflows, the GA produces a 115% improvement over the next-best alternative. (Note that although we are optimising against the business value metric we defined earlier, genetic algorithms are able to converge towards the optimal value of any metric, as long as the evaluation function can consistently measure a chromosomes value with that metric.)",
                "As expected, the greedy algorithm performs very poorly because it does the worst job at balancing load: all business processes for a given service type are assigned to only one server (the one advertised to have the fastest completion time), and as more business processes arrive, the providers performance degrades linearly.",
                "The round-robin scheme is initially outperformed by the randomproportional scheme up to around 120 workflows (as shown in the magnified graph of Figure 4), but as the number of workflows increases, the round-robin scheme consistently wins over randomproportional.",

                "Each of these requests target a particular service type (e.g. airline reservations, hotel reservations, car reservations, etc. ), and for each service type, there are multiple instances of service providers that publish a web service interface.",
                "An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes, and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative business value metric for the workflow; intuitively, it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals.",
                "We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the web service providers and the scheduling agent such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency.",

                "We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement, acceptable if it completes within a constant factor κ 31 of its QoS bound (in our experiments we chose κ=3), or failing if it finishes beyond κ times its QoS bound.",
                "For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing.",
                "The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others.",
                "Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers.",

                "Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load.",
                "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",

                "Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit.",
                "The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.",

(We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former schemes results are shown here.) • A strawman greedy algorithm that always assigns business processes to the service provider that has the fastest guaranteed completion time.",

                "Although previous research efforts have looked at ways to intelligently automate the composition of web services into workflows (e.g. [1, 9]), an important remaining problem is the assignment of web service requests to the underlying web service providers in a multi-tiered runtime scenario within constraints.",

                "Workflows comprise multiple related business processes that are web service consumers; here we assume that the workflows represent requested service from customers or automated systems and that the workflow has already been composed with an existing choreography toolkit.",
                "These workflows are then submitted to a portal (not shown) that acts as a <br>scheduling agent</br> between the web service consumers and the web service providers.",
                "In this example, a workflow could represent the actions needed to instantiate a vacation itinerary, where one business process requests booking an airline ticket, another business process requests a hotel room, and so forth.",
                "Each of these requests target a particular service type (e.g. airline reservations, hotel reservations, car reservations, etc. ), and for each service type, there are multiple instances of service providers that publish a web service interface.",
                "An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes, and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative business value metric for the workflow; intuitively, it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals.",
                "We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the web service providers and the <br>scheduling agent</br> such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency.",
                "The resulting problem is then to schedule and assign the business processes requests for service types to one of the service providers for that type.",
                "The scheduling must be done such that the aggregate business value across all the workflows is maximised.",

                "The classic job-shop scheduling problem, shown to be NP-complete [4] [3], is similar to ours in that tasks within a job must be scheduled onto machinery (c.f. our scenario is that business processes within a workflow must be scheduled onto web service providers).",
                "The salient differences are that the machines can process only one job at a time (we assume servers can multi-task but with degraded performance and a maximum concurrency level), tasks within a job cannot simultaneously run on different machines (we assume business processes can be assigned to any available server), and the principal metric of performance is the makespan, which is the time for the last task among all the jobs to complete (and as we show later, optimising on the makespan is insufficient for scheduling the business processes, necessitating different metrics). 3.",
                "DESIGN In this section we describe our model and discuss how we can find scheduling assignments using a genetic search algorithm. 3.1 Model We base our model on the simplified scenario shown in Figure 1.",
                "Specifically, we assume that users or automated systems request the execution of a workflow.",
                "The workflows comprise business processes, each of which makes one web service invocation to a service type.",
                "Further, business processes have an ordering in the workflow.",
                "The arrangement and execution of the business processes and the data flow between them are all managed by a composition or choreography tool (e.g. [1, 9]).",
                "Although composition languages can use sophisticated flow-control mechanisms such as conditional branches, for simplicity we assume the processes execute sequentially in a given order.",
                "This scenario can be naturally extended to more complex relationships that can be expressed in BPEL [7], which defines how business processes interact, messages are exchanged, activities are ordered, and exceptions are handled.",
                "Due to space constraints, we focus on the problem space presented here and will extend our model to more advanced deployment scenarios in the future.",
                "Each workflow has a QoS requirement to complete within a specified number of time units (e.g. on the order of seconds, as detailed in the Experiments section).",
                "Upon completion (or failure), the workflow is assigned a business value.",
                "We extended this approach further and considered different types of workflow completion in order to model differentiated QoS levels that can be applied by businesses (for example, to provide tiered customer service).",
                "We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement, acceptable if it completes within a constant factor κ 31 of its QoS bound (in our experiments we chose κ=3), or failing if it finishes beyond κ times its QoS bound.",
                "For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing.",
                "The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others.",
                "Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers.",
                "We assume that the providers make service level agreements (SLAs) to guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a web service invocation.",
                "Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load.",
                "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",
                "In our experiments we vary α, β, and γ with different distributions.",
                "Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit.",
                "The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.",
                "Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows, it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed.",
                "This intuitive observation suggests that traditional scheduling approaches such as round-robin or proportional assignments will not fare well, which is what we observe and discuss in Section 4.",
                "On the other hand, an exhaustive search of all the possible assignments will find the best schedule, but the computational complexity is prohibitively high.",
                "Suppose there are W workflows with an average of B business processes per workflow.",
                "Further, in the worst case each business process requests one service type, for which there are P providers.",
                "There are thus W · PB combinations to explore to find the optimal assignments of business processes to providers.",
                "Even for small configurations (e.g.",
                "W =10, B=5, P=10), the computational time for exhaustive search is significant, and in our work we look to scale these parameters.",
                "In the next subsection, discuss how a genetic search algorithm can be used to converge toward the optimum scheduling assignments. 3.2 Genetic algorithm Given an exponential search space of business process assignments to web service providers, the problem is to find the optimal assignment that produces the overall highest aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "To explore the solution space, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) search heuristic that simulates Darwinian natural selection by having members of a population compete to survive in order to pass their genetic chromosomes onto the next generation; after successive generations, there is a tendency for the chromosomes to converge toward the best combination [5] [6].",
                "Although other search heuristics exist that can solve optimization problems (e.g. simulated annealing or steepest-ascent hillclimbing), the business process scheduling problem fits well with a GA because potential solutions can be represented in a matrix form and allows us to use prior research in effective GA chromosome recombination to form new members of the population (e.g. [2]). 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 1 Figure 2: An example chromosome representing a scheduling assignment of (workflow,service type) → service provider.",

(We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former schemes results are shown here.) • A strawman greedy algorithm that always assigns business processes to the service provider that has the fastest guaranteed completion time.",
                "This algorithm represents a naive approach based on greedy, local observations of each workflow without taking into consideration all workflows.",
                "In the experiments that follow, all results were averaged across 20 trials, and to help normalise the effects of randomisation used during the GA, each trial started by reading in pre-initialised data from disk.",

                "As can be seen, the GA consistently produces the highest business value even as the number of workflows grows; at 1000 workflows, the GA produces a 115% improvement over the next-best alternative. (Note that although we are optimising against the business value metric we defined earlier, genetic algorithms are able to converge towards the optimal value of any metric, as long as the evaluation function can consistently measure a chromosomes value with that metric.)",
                "As expected, the greedy algorithm performs very poorly because it does the worst job at balancing load: all business processes for a given service type are assigned to only one server (the one advertised to have the fastest completion time), and as more business processes arrive, the providers performance degrades linearly.",
                "The round-robin scheme is initially outperformed by the randomproportional scheme up to around 120 workflows (as shown in the magnified graph of Figure 4), but as the number of workflows increases, the round-robin scheme consistently wins over randomproportional.",

                "Workflows comprise multiple related business processes that are web service consumers; here we assume that the workflows represent requested service from customers or automated systems and that the workflow has already been composed with an existing choreography toolkit.",
                "These workflows are then submitted to a portal (not shown) that acts as a scheduling agent between the web service consumers and the web service providers.",
                "In this example, a workflow could represent the actions needed to instantiate a vacation itinerary, where one business process requests booking an airline ticket, another business process requests a hotel room, and so forth.",
                "Each of these requests target a particular service type (e.g. airline reservations, hotel reservations, car reservations, etc. ), and for each service type, there are multiple instances of service providers that publish a web service interface.",
                "An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes, and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative business value metric for the workflow; intuitively, it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals.",
                "We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the web service providers and the scheduling agent such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency.",
                "The resulting problem is then to schedule and assign the business processes requests for service types to one of the service providers for that type.",

                "Specifically, we assume that users or automated systems request the execution of a workflow.",
                "The workflows comprise business processes, each of which makes one web service invocation to a service type.",
                "Further, business processes have an ordering in the workflow.",
                "The arrangement and execution of the business processes and the data flow between them are all managed by a composition or choreography tool (e.g. [1, 9]).",
                "Although composition languages can use sophisticated flow-control mechanisms such as conditional branches, for simplicity we assume the processes execute sequentially in a given order.",
                "This scenario can be naturally extended to more complex relationships that can be expressed in BPEL [7], which defines how business processes interact, messages are exchanged, activities are ordered, and exceptions are handled.",
                "Due to space constraints, we focus on the problem space presented here and will extend our model to more advanced deployment scenarios in the future.",
                "Each workflow has a QoS requirement to complete within a specified number of time units (e.g. on the order of seconds, as detailed in the Experiments section).",
                "Upon completion (or failure), the workflow is assigned a business value.",
                "We extended this approach further and considered different types of workflow completion in order to model differentiated QoS levels that can be applied by businesses (for example, to provide tiered customer service).",
                "We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement, acceptable if it completes within a constant factor κ 31 of its QoS bound (in our experiments we chose κ=3), or failing if it finishes beyond κ times its QoS bound.",
                "For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing.",
                "The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others.",
                "Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers.",
                "We assume that the providers make service level agreements (SLAs) to guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a web service invocation.",
                "Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load.",
                "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web <br>service request</br>s is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",
                "In our experiments we vary α, β, and γ with different distributions.",
                "Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit.",
                "The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.",
                "Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows, it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed.",
                "This intuitive observation suggests that traditional scheduling approaches such as round-robin or proportional assignments will not fare well, which is what we observe and discuss in Section 4.",
                "On the other hand, an exhaustive search of all the possible assignments will find the best schedule, but the computational complexity is prohibitively high.",
                "Suppose there are W workflows with an average of B business processes per workflow.",
                "Further, in the worst case each business process requests one service type, for which there are P providers.",

                "Even for small configurations (e.g.",
                "W =10, B=5, P=10), the computational time for exhaustive search is significant, and in our work we look to scale these parameters.",
                "In the next subsection, discuss how a genetic search algorithm can be used to converge toward the optimum scheduling assignments. 3.2 Genetic algorithm Given an exponential search space of business process assignments to web service providers, the problem is to find the optimal assignment that produces the overall highest aggregate business value across all workflows.",

                "Although other search heuristics exist that can solve optimization problems (e.g. simulated annealing or steepest-ascent hillclimbing), the business process scheduling problem fits well with a GA because potential solutions can be represented in a matrix form and allows us to use prior research in effective GA chromosome recombination to form new members of the population (e.g. [2]). 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 1 Figure 2: An example chromosome representing a scheduling assignment of (workflow,service type) → service provider.",

(We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former schemes results are shown here.) • A strawman greedy algorithm that always assigns business processes to the service provider that has the fastest guaranteed completion time.",

                "Each of these requests target a particular service type (e.g. airline reservations, hotel reservations, car reservations, etc. ), and for each service type, there are multiple instances of service providers that publish a web service interface.",
                "An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes, and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative business value metric for the workflow; intuitively, it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals.",
                "We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the web service providers and the scheduling agent such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency.",

                "Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load.",
                "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",
                "In our experiments we vary α, β, and γ with different distributions.",
                "Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit.",
                "The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.",
                "Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows, it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed.",

                "The salient differences are that the machines can process only one job at a time (we assume servers can multi-task but with degraded performance and a maximum concurrency level), tasks within a job cannot simultaneously run on different machines (we assume business processes can be assigned to any available server), and the principal metric of performance is the makespan, which is the time for the last task among all the jobs to complete (and as we show later, optimising on the makespan is insufficient for scheduling the business processes, necessitating different metrics). 3.",
                "DESIGN In this section we describe our model and discuss how we can find scheduling assignments using a genetic search algorithm. 3.1 Model We base our model on the simplified scenario shown in Figure 1.",
                "Specifically, we assume that users or automated systems request the execution of a workflow.",
                "The workflows comprise business processes, each of which makes one web service invocation to a service type.",
                "Further, business processes have an ordering in the workflow.",
                "The arrangement and execution of the business processes and the data flow between them are all managed by a composition or choreography tool (e.g. [1, 9]).",
                "Although composition languages can use sophisticated flow-control mechanisms such as conditional branches, for simplicity we assume the processes execute sequentially in a given order.",
                "This scenario can be naturally extended to more complex relationships that can be expressed in BPEL [7], which defines how business processes interact, messages are exchanged, activities are ordered, and exceptions are handled.",
                "Due to space constraints, we focus on the problem space presented here and will extend our model to more advanced deployment scenarios in the future.",
                "Each workflow has a QoS requirement to complete within a specified number of time units (e.g. on the order of seconds, as detailed in the Experiments section).",
                "Upon completion (or failure), the workflow is assigned a business value.",
                "We extended this approach further and considered different types of workflow completion in order to model differentiated QoS levels that can be applied by businesses (for example, to provide tiered customer service).",
                "We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement, acceptable if it completes within a constant factor κ 31 of its QoS bound (in our experiments we chose κ=3), or failing if it finishes beyond κ times its QoS bound.",
                "For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing.",
                "The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others.",
                "Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers.",
                "We assume that the providers make service level agreements (SLAs) to guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a web service invocation.",
                "Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load.",
                "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",
                "In our experiments we vary α, β, and γ with different distributions.",
                "Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit.",
                "The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.",
                "Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows, it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed.",
                "This intuitive observation suggests that traditional scheduling approaches such as round-robin or proportional assignments will not fare well, which is what we observe and discuss in Section 4.",
                "On the other hand, an exhaustive search of all the possible assignments will find the best schedule, but the computational complexity is prohibitively high.",
                "Suppose there are W workflows with an average of B business processes per workflow.",
                "Further, in the worst case each business process requests one service type, for which there are P providers.",
                "There are thus W · PB combinations to explore to find the optimal assignments of business processes to providers.",
                "Even for small configurations (e.g.",
                "W =10, B=5, P=10), the computational time for exhaustive search is significant, and in our work we look to scale these parameters.",
                "In the next subsection, discuss how a genetic search algorithm can be used to converge toward the optimum scheduling assignments. 3.2 Genetic algorithm Given an exponential search space of business process assignments to web service providers, the problem is to find the optimal assignment that produces the overall highest aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "To explore the solution space, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) search heuristic that simulates Darwinian natural selection by having members of a population compete to survive in order to pass their genetic chromosomes onto the next generation; after successive generations, there is a tendency for the chromosomes to converge toward the best combination [5] [6].",
                "Although other search heuristics exist that can solve optimization problems (e.g. simulated annealing or steepest-ascent hillclimbing), the business process scheduling problem fits well with a GA because potential solutions can be represented in a matrix form and allows us to use prior research in effective GA chromosome recombination to form new members of the population (e.g. [2]). 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 1 Figure 2: An example chromosome representing a scheduling assignment of (workflow,service type) → service provider.",
                "Each row represents a workflow, and each column represents a service type.",
                "For example, here there are 3 workflows (0 to 2) and 5 service types (0 to 4).",
                "In workflow 0, any request for service type 3 goes to provider 2.",
                "Note that the service provider identifier is within a range limited to its service type (i.e. its column), so the 2 listed for service type 3 is a different server from server 2 in other columns.",

                "The parents recombine to produce children, simulating sexual crossover, and occasionally a mutation may arise which produces new characteristics that were not available in either parent.",
                "The principal idea is that we would like the children to be different from the parents (in order to explore more of the solution space) yet not too different (in order to contain the portions of the chromosome that result in good scheduling assignments).",

                "EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS In this section we show the benefit of using our GA-based scheduler.",
                "Because we wanted to scale the scenarios up to a large number of workflows (up to 1000 in our experiments), we implemented a simulation program that allowed us to vary parameters and to measure the results with different metrics.",

                "This approach provides the simplest scheme for load-balancing. • A random-proportional algorithm that proportionally assigns business processes to the service providers; that is, for a given service type, the service providers are ranked by their guaranteed completion time, and business processes are assigned proportionally to the providers based on their completion time. (We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former schemes results are shown here.) • A strawman greedy algorithm that always assigns business processes to the service provider that has the fastest guaranteed completion time.",
                "This algorithm represents a naive approach based on greedy, local observations of each workflow without taking into consideration all workflows.",
                "In the experiments that follow, all results were averaged across 20 trials, and to help normalise the effects of randomisation used during the GA, each trial started by reading in pre-initialised data from disk.",

                "As can be seen, the GA consistently produces the highest business value even as the number of workflows grows; at 1000 workflows, the GA produces a 115% improvement over the next-best alternative. (Note that although we are optimising against the business value metric we defined earlier, genetic algorithms are able to converge towards the optimal value of any metric, as long as the evaluation function can consistently measure a chromosomes value with that metric.)",
                "As expected, the greedy algorithm performs very poorly because it does the worst job at balancing load: all business processes for a given service type are assigned to only one server (the one advertised to have the fastest completion time), and as more business processes arrive, the providers performance degrades linearly.",
                "The round-robin scheme is initially outperformed by the randomproportional scheme up to around 120 workflows (as shown in the magnified graph of Figure 4), but as the number of workflows increases, the round-robin scheme consistently wins over randomproportional.",

                "Although previous research efforts have looked at ways to intelligently automate the composition of web services into workflows (e.g. [1, 9]), an important remaining problem is the assignment of web service requests to the underlying web service providers in a multi-tiered runtime scenario within constraints.",

                "Workflows comprise multiple related business processes that are web service consumers; here we assume that the workflows represent requested service from customers or automated systems and that the workflow has already been composed with an existing choreography toolkit.",
                "These workflows are then submitted to a portal (not shown) that acts as a scheduling agent between the web service consumers and the web service providers.",
                "In this example, a workflow could represent the actions needed to instantiate a vacation itinerary, where one business process requests booking an airline ticket, another business process requests a hotel room, and so forth.",
                "Each of these requests target a particular service type (e.g. airline reservations, hotel reservations, car reservations, etc. ), and for each service type, there are multiple instances of service providers that publish a web service interface.",
                "An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes, and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative business value metric for the workflow; intuitively, it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals.",
                "We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the web service providers and the scheduling agent such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency.",
                "The resulting problem is then to schedule and assign the business processes requests for service types to one of the service providers for that type.",
                "The scheduling must be done such that the aggregate business value across all the workflows is maximised.",

                "The workflows comprise business processes, each of which makes one web service invocation to a service type.",
                "Further, business processes have an ordering in the workflow.",
                "The arrangement and execution of the business processes and the data flow between them are all managed by a composition or choreography tool (e.g. [1, 9]).",
                "Although composition languages can use sophisticated flow-control mechanisms such as conditional branches, for simplicity we assume the processes execute sequentially in a given order.",
                "This scenario can be naturally extended to more complex relationships that can be expressed in BPEL [7], which defines how business processes interact, messages are exchanged, activities are ordered, and exceptions are handled.",
                "Due to space constraints, we focus on the problem space presented here and will extend our model to more advanced deployment scenarios in the future.",
                "Each workflow has a QoS requirement to complete within a specified number of time units (e.g. on the order of seconds, as detailed in the Experiments section).",
                "Upon completion (or failure), the workflow is assigned a business value.",
                "We extended this approach further and considered different types of workflow completion in order to model differentiated QoS levels that can be applied by businesses (for example, to provide tiered customer service).",
                "We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement, acceptable if it completes within a constant factor κ 31 of its QoS bound (in our experiments we chose κ=3), or failing if it finishes beyond κ times its QoS bound.",
                "For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing.",
                "The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others.",
                "Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers.",
                "We assume that the providers make service level agreements (SLAs) to guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a web service invocation.",
                "Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load.",
                "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",
                "In our experiments we vary α, β, and γ with different distributions.",
                "Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit.",
                "The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.",
                "Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows, it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed.",
                "This intuitive observation suggests that traditional scheduling approaches such as round-robin or proportional assignments will not fare well, which is what we observe and discuss in Section 4.",
                "On the other hand, an exhaustive search of all the possible assignments will find the best schedule, but the computational complexity is prohibitively high.",
                "Suppose there are W workflows with an average of B business processes per workflow.",

                "Even for small configurations (e.g.",
                "W =10, B=5, P=10), the computational time for exhaustive search is significant, and in our work we look to scale these parameters.",
                "In the next subsection, discuss how a genetic search algorithm can be used to converge toward the optimum scheduling assignments. 3.2 Genetic algorithm Given an exponential search space of business process assignments to web service providers, the problem is to find the optimal assignment that produces the overall highest aggregate business value across all workflows.",

                "Although other search heuristics exist that can solve optimization problems (e.g. simulated annealing or steepest-ascent hillclimbing), the business process scheduling problem fits well with a GA because potential solutions can be represented in a matrix form and allows us to use prior research in effective GA chromosome recombination to form new members of the population (e.g. [2]). 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 1 Figure 2: An example chromosome representing a scheduling assignment of (workflow,service type) → service provider.",

(We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former schemes results are shown here.) • A strawman greedy algorithm that always assigns business processes to the service provider that has the fastest guaranteed completion time.",
                "This algorithm represents a naive approach based on greedy, local observations of each workflow without taking into consideration all workflows.",

                "As expected, the greedy algorithm performs very poorly because it does the worst job at balancing load: all business processes for a given service type are assigned to only one server (the one advertised to have the fastest completion time), and as more business processes arrive, the providers performance degrades linearly.",

                "Although previous research efforts have looked at ways to intelligently automate the composition of web services into workflows (e.g. [1, 9]), an important remaining problem is the assignment of web service requests to the underlying web service providers in a multi-tiered runtime scenario within constraints.",

                "The problem of scheduling web service requests to providers is relevant to modern business domains that depend on multi-tiered service provisioning.",

                "Workflows comprise multiple related business processes that are web service consumers; here we assume that the workflows represent requested service from customers or automated systems and that the workflow has already been composed with an existing choreography toolkit.",
                "These workflows are then submitted to a portal (not shown) that acts as a scheduling agent between the web service consumers and the web service providers.",
                "In this example, a workflow could represent the actions needed to instantiate a vacation itinerary, where one business process requests booking an airline ticket, another business process requests a hotel room, and so forth.",
                "Each of these requests target a particular service type (e.g. airline reservations, hotel reservations, car reservations, etc. ), and for each service type, there are multiple instances of service providers that publish a web service interface.",
                "An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes, and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative <br>business value metric</br> for the workflow; intuitively, it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals.",
                "We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the web service providers and the scheduling agent such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency.",
                "The resulting problem is then to schedule and assign the business processes requests for service types to one of the service providers for that type.",
                "The scheduling must be done such that the aggregate business value across all the workflows is maximised.",
                "In Section 3 we state the scenario as a combinatorial problem and utilise a genetic search algorithm [5] to find the best assignment of web service requests to providers.",

                "However, the provisioning techniques do not consider the challenges faced when there are alternative query execution plans and replicated data sources. [8] presents a feedback-based scheduling mechanism for multi-tiered systems with back-end databases, but unlike our work, it assumes a tighter coupling between the various components of the system.",
                "Our work also builds upon prior scheduling research.",
                "The classic job-shop scheduling problem, shown to be NP-complete [4] [3], is similar to ours in that tasks within a job must be scheduled onto machinery (c.f. our scenario is that business processes within a workflow must be scheduled onto web service providers).",
                "The salient differences are that the machines can process only one job at a time (we assume servers can multi-task but with degraded performance and a maximum concurrency level), tasks within a job cannot simultaneously run on different machines (we assume business processes can be assigned to any available server), and the principal metric of performance is the makespan, which is the time for the last task among all the jobs to complete (and as we show later, optimising on the makespan is insufficient for scheduling the business processes, necessitating different metrics). 3.",
                "DESIGN In this section we describe our model and discuss how we can find scheduling assignments using a genetic search algorithm. 3.1 Model We base our model on the simplified scenario shown in Figure 1.",
                "Specifically, we assume that users or automated systems request the execution of a workflow.",
                "The workflows comprise business processes, each of which makes one web service invocation to a service type.",
                "Further, business processes have an ordering in the workflow.",
                "The arrangement and execution of the business processes and the data flow between them are all managed by a composition or choreography tool (e.g. [1, 9]).",
                "Although composition languages can use sophisticated flow-control mechanisms such as conditional branches, for simplicity we assume the processes execute sequentially in a given order.",
                "This scenario can be naturally extended to more complex relationships that can be expressed in BPEL [7], which defines how business processes interact, messages are exchanged, activities are ordered, and exceptions are handled.",
                "Due to space constraints, we focus on the problem space presented here and will extend our model to more advanced deployment scenarios in the future.",
                "Each workflow has a QoS requirement to complete within a specified number of time units (e.g. on the order of seconds, as detailed in the Experiments section).",
                "Upon completion (or failure), the workflow is assigned a business value.",
                "We extended this approach further and considered different types of workflow completion in order to model differentiated QoS levels that can be applied by businesses (for example, to provide tiered customer service).",
                "We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement, acceptable if it completes within a constant factor κ 31 of its QoS bound (in our experiments we chose κ=3), or failing if it finishes beyond κ times its QoS bound.",
                "For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing.",
                "The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others.",
                "Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers.",
                "We assume that the providers make service level agreements (SLAs) to guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a web service invocation.",
                "Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load.",
                "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",
                "In our experiments we vary α, β, and γ with different distributions.",
                "Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit.",
                "The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.",
                "Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows, it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed.",
                "This intuitive observation suggests that traditional scheduling approaches such as round-robin or proportional assignments will not fare well, which is what we observe and discuss in Section 4.",
                "On the other hand, an exhaustive search of all the possible assignments will find the best schedule, but the computational complexity is prohibitively high.",
                "Suppose there are W workflows with an average of B business processes per workflow.",
                "Further, in the worst case each business process requests one service type, for which there are P providers.",
                "There are thus W · PB combinations to explore to find the optimal assignments of business processes to providers.",
                "Even for small configurations (e.g.",
                "W =10, B=5, P=10), the computational time for exhaustive search is significant, and in our work we look to scale these parameters.",
                "In the next subsection, discuss how a genetic search algorithm can be used to converge toward the optimum scheduling assignments. 3.2 Genetic algorithm Given an exponential search space of business process assignments to web service providers, the problem is to find the optimal assignment that produces the overall highest aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "To explore the solution space, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) search heuristic that simulates Darwinian natural selection by having members of a population compete to survive in order to pass their genetic chromosomes onto the next generation; after successive generations, there is a tendency for the chromosomes to converge toward the best combination [5] [6].",
                "Although other search heuristics exist that can solve optimization problems (e.g. simulated annealing or steepest-ascent hillclimbing), the business process scheduling problem fits well with a GA because potential solutions can be represented in a matrix form and allows us to use prior research in effective GA chromosome recombination to form new members of the population (e.g. [2]). 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 1 Figure 2: An example chromosome representing a scheduling assignment of (workflow,service type) → service provider.",

                "Because we wanted to scale the scenarios up to a large number of workflows (up to 1000 in our experiments), we implemented a simulation program that allowed us to vary parameters and to measure the results with different metrics.",

                "This approach provides the simplest scheme for load-balancing. • A random-proportional algorithm that proportionally assigns business processes to the service providers; that is, for a given service type, the service providers are ranked by their guaranteed completion time, and business processes are assigned proportionally to the providers based on their completion time. (We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former schemes results are shown here.) • A strawman greedy algorithm that always assigns business processes to the service provider that has the fastest guaranteed completion time.",
                "This algorithm represents a naive approach based on greedy, local observations of each workflow without taking into consideration all workflows.",
                "In the experiments that follow, all results were averaged across 20 trials, and to help normalise the effects of randomisation used during the GA, each trial started by reading in pre-initialised data from disk.",

                "In Figure 3 we show the results of running our GA against the three candidate alternatives.",
                "The x-axis shows the number for workflows scaled up to 1000, and the y-axis shows the aggregate business value for all workflows.",
                "As can be seen, the GA consistently produces the highest business value even as the number of workflows grows; at 1000 workflows, the GA produces a 115% improvement over the next-best alternative. (Note that although we are optimising against the <br>business value metric</br> we defined earlier, genetic algorithms are able to converge towards the optimal value of any metric, as long as the evaluation function can consistently measure a chromosomes value with that metric.)",
                "As expected, the greedy algorithm performs very poorly because it does the worst job at balancing load: all business processes for a given service type are assigned to only one server (the one advertised to have the fastest completion time), and as more business processes arrive, the providers performance degrades linearly.",
                "The round-robin scheme is initially outperformed by the randomproportional scheme up to around 120 workflows (as shown in the magnified graph of Figure 4), but as the number of workflows increases, the round-robin scheme consistently wins over randomproportional.",

                "Although previous research efforts have looked at ways to intelligently automate the composition of web services into workflows (e.g. [1, 9]), an important remaining problem is the assignment of web service requests to the underlying web service providers in a multi-tiered runtime scenario within constraints.",

                "Workflows comprise multiple related business processes that are web service consumers; here we assume that the workflows represent requested service from customers or automated systems and that the workflow has already been composed with an existing choreography toolkit.",
                "These workflows are then submitted to a portal (not shown) that acts as a scheduling agent between the web service consumers and the web service providers.",
                "In this example, a workflow could represent the actions needed to instantiate a vacation itinerary, where one business process requests booking an airline ticket, another business process requests a hotel room, and so forth.",
                "Each of these requests target a particular service type (e.g. airline reservations, hotel reservations, car reservations, etc. ), and for each service type, there are multiple instances of service providers that publish a web service interface.",
                "An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes, and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative business value metric for the workflow; intuitively, it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals.",
                "We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the web service providers and the scheduling agent such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency.",
                "The resulting problem is then to schedule and assign the business processes requests for service types to one of the service providers for that type.",

                "Specifically, we assume that users or automated systems request the execution of a workflow.",
                "The workflows comprise business processes, each of which makes one web service invocation to a service type.",
                "Further, business processes have an ordering in the workflow.",
                "The arrangement and execution of the business processes and the data flow between them are all managed by a composition or choreography tool (e.g. [1, 9]).",
                "Although composition languages can use sophisticated flow-control mechanisms such as conditional branches, for simplicity we assume the processes execute sequentially in a given order.",
                "This scenario can be naturally extended to more complex relationships that can be expressed in BPEL [7], which defines how business processes interact, messages are exchanged, activities are ordered, and exceptions are handled.",
                "Due to space constraints, we focus on the problem space presented here and will extend our model to more advanced deployment scenarios in the future.",
                "Each workflow has a QoS requirement to complete within a specified number of time units (e.g. on the order of seconds, as detailed in the Experiments section).",
                "Upon completion (or failure), the workflow is assigned a business value.",
                "We extended this approach further and considered different types of workflow completion in order to model differentiated QoS levels that can be applied by businesses (for example, to provide tiered customer service).",
                "We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement, acceptable if it completes within a constant factor κ 31 of its QoS bound (in our experiments we chose κ=3), or failing if it finishes beyond κ times its QoS bound.",
                "For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing.",
                "The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others.",
                "Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers.",
                "We assume that the providers make service level agreements (SLAs) to guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a web service invocation.",
                "Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load.",
                "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",
                "In our experiments we vary α, β, and γ with different distributions.",
                "Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit.",
                "The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.",
                "Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows, it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed.",
                "This intuitive observation suggests that traditional scheduling approaches such as round-robin or proportional assignments will not fare well, which is what we observe and discuss in Section 4.",
                "On the other hand, an exhaustive search of all the possible assignments will find the best schedule, but the computational complexity is prohibitively high.",
                "Suppose there are W workflows with an average of B business processes per workflow.",
                "Further, in the worst case each business process requests one service type, for which there are P providers.",
                "There are thus W · PB combinations to explore to find the optimal assignments of business processes to providers.",
                "Even for small configurations (e.g.",
                "W =10, B=5, P=10), the computational time for exhaustive search is significant, and in our work we look to scale these parameters.",
                "In the next subsection, discuss how a genetic search algorithm can be used to converge toward the optimum scheduling assignments. 3.2 Genetic algorithm Given an exponential search space of business process assignments to web service providers, the problem is to find the optimal assignment that produces the overall highest aggregate business value across all workflows.",

                "Although other search heuristics exist that can solve optimization problems (e.g. simulated annealing or steepest-ascent hillclimbing), the business process scheduling problem fits well with a GA because potential solutions can be represented in a matrix form and allows us to use prior research in effective GA chromosome recombination to form new members of the population (e.g. [2]). 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 1 Figure 2: An example chromosome representing a scheduling assignment of (workflow,service type) → service provider.",

(We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former schemes results are shown here.) • A strawman greedy algorithm that always assigns business processes to the service provider that has the fastest guaranteed completion time.",

                "An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes, and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative business value metric for the workflow; intuitively, it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals.",

                "For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing.",
                "The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others.",
                "Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers.",

                "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",

                "Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit.",
                "The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.",
                "Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows, it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed.",

(We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former schemes results are shown here.) • A strawman greedy algorithm that always assigns business processes to the service provider that has the fastest guaranteed completion time.",

                "An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes, and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative business value metric for the workflow; intuitively, it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals.",

                "The workflows comprise business processes, each of which makes one web service invocation to a service type.",
                "Further, business processes have an ordering in the workflow.",
                "The arrangement and execution of the business processes and the data flow between them are all managed by a composition or choreography tool (e.g. [1, 9]).",
                "Although composition languages can use sophisticated flow-control mechanisms such as conditional branches, for simplicity we assume the processes execute sequentially in a given order.",
                "This scenario can be naturally extended to more complex relationships that can be expressed in BPEL [7], which defines how business processes interact, messages are exchanged, activities are ordered, and exceptions are handled.",
                "Due to space constraints, we focus on the problem space presented here and will extend our model to more advanced deployment scenarios in the future.",
                "Each workflow has a QoS requirement to complete within a specified number of time units (e.g. on the order of seconds, as detailed in the Experiments section).",
                "Upon completion (or failure), the workflow is assigned a business value.",
                "We extended this approach further and considered different types of workflow completion in order to model differentiated QoS levels that can be applied by businesses (for example, to provide tiered customer service).",
                "We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement, acceptable if it completes within a constant factor κ 31 of its QoS bound (in our experiments we chose κ=3), or failing if it finishes beyond κ times its QoS bound.",
                "For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing.",
                "The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others.",
                "Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers.",
                "We assume that the providers make service level agreements (SLAs) to guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a web service invocation.",
                "Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load.",
                "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",
                "In our experiments we vary α, β, and γ with different distributions.",
                "Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit.",
                "The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.",
                "Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows, it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed.",
                "This intuitive observation suggests that traditional scheduling approaches such as round-robin or proportional assignments will not fare well, which is what we observe and discuss in Section 4.",
                "On the other hand, an exhaustive search of all the possible assignments will find the best schedule, but the computational complexity is prohibitively high.",
                "Suppose there are W workflows with an average of B business processes per workflow.",
                "Further, in the worst case each business process requests one service type, for which there are P providers.",
                "There are thus W · PB combinations to explore to find the optimal assignments of business processes to providers.",
                "Even for small configurations (e.g.",
                "W =10, B=5, P=10), the computational time for exhaustive search is significant, and in our work we look to scale these parameters.",
                "In the next subsection, discuss how a genetic search algorithm can be used to converge toward the optimum scheduling assignments. 3.2 Genetic algorithm Given an exponential search space of business process assignments to web service providers, the problem is to find the optimal assignment that produces the overall highest aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "To explore the solution space, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) search heuristic that simulates Darwinian natural selection by having members of a population compete to survive in order to pass their genetic chromosomes onto the next generation; after successive generations, there is a tendency for the chromosomes to converge toward the best combination [5] [6].",
                "Although other search heuristics exist that can solve optimization problems (e.g. simulated annealing or steepest-ascent hillclimbing), the business process scheduling problem fits well with a GA because potential solutions can be represented in a matrix form and allows us to use prior research in effective GA chromosome recombination to form new members of the population (e.g. [2]). 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 1 Figure 2: An example chromosome representing a scheduling assignment of (workflow,service type) → service provider.",
                "Each row represents a workflow, and each column represents a service type.",
                "For example, here there are 3 workflows (0 to 2) and 5 service types (0 to 4).",
                "In workflow 0, any request for service type 3 goes to provider 2.",
                "Note that the service provider identifier is within a range limited to its service type (i.e. its column), so the 2 listed for service type 3 is a different server from server 2 in other columns.",
                "Chromosome representation of a solution.",
                "In Figure 2 we show an example chromosome that encodes one scheduling assignment.",
                "The representation is a 2-dimensional matrix that maps {workflow, service type} to a service provider.",
                "For a business process in workflow i and utilising service type j, the (i, j)th entry in the table is the identifier for the service provider to which the business process is assigned.",
                "Note that the service provider identifier is within a range limited to its service type.",
                "GA execution.",
                "A GA proceeds as follows.",
                "Initially a random set of chromosomes is created for the population.",
                "The chromosomes are evaluated (hashed) to some metric, and the best ones are chosen to be parents.",
                "In our problem, the evaluation produces the net business value across all workflows after executing all business processes once they are assigned to their respective service providers according to the mapping in the chromosome.",
                "The parents recombine to produce children, simulating sexual crossover, and occasionally a mutation may arise which produces new characteristics that were not available in either parent.",
                "The principal idea is that we would like the children to be different from the parents (in order to explore more of the solution space) yet not too different (in order to contain the portions of the chromosome that result in good scheduling assignments).",
                "Note that finding the global optimum is not guaranteed because the recombination and mutation are stochastic.",
                "GA recombination and mutation.",
                "As mentioned, the chromosomes are 2-dimensional matrices that represent scheduling assignments.",
                "To simulate sexual recombination of two chromosomes to produce a new child chromosome, we applied a one-point crossover scheme twice (once along each dimension).",
                "The crossover is best explained by analogy to Cartesian space as follows.",
                "A random point is chosen in the matrix to be coordinate (0, 0).",
                "Matrix elements from quadrants II and IV from the first parent and elements from quadrants I and III from the second parent are used to create the new child.",
                "This approach follows GA best practices by keeping contiguous chromosome segments together as they are transmitted from parent to child.",
                "The uni-chromosome mutation scheme randomly changes one of the service provider assignments to another provider within the available range.",
                "Other recombination and mutation schemes are an area of research in the GA community, and we look to explore new operators in future work.",
                "GA evaluation function.",
                "An important GA component is the evaluation function.",
                "Given a particular chromosome representing one scheduling mapping, the function deterministically calculates the net business value across all workloads.",
                "The business processes in each workload are assigned to service providers, and each providers completion time is calculated based on the service agreement guarantee using the parameters mentioned in Section 3.1, namely the unloaded completion time α, the maximum concur32 rency β, and a coefficient γ that controls the linear performance degradation under heavy load.",
                "Note that the evaluation function can be easily replaced if desired; for example, other evaluation functions can model different service provider guarantees or parallel workflows. 4.",
                "EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS In this section we show the benefit of using our GA-based scheduler.",
                "Because we wanted to scale the scenarios up to a large number of workflows (up to 1000 in our experiments), we implemented a simulation program that allowed us to vary parameters and to measure the results with different metrics.",
                "The simulator was written in standard C++ and was run on a Linux (Fedora Core) desktop computer running at 2.8 GHz with 1GB of RAM.",
                "We compared our algorithm against alternative candidates: • A well-known round-robin algorithm that assigns each business process in circular fashion to the service providers for a particular service type.",
                "This approach provides the simplest scheme for load-balancing. • A random-proportional algorithm that proportionally assigns business processes to the service providers; that is, for a given service type, the service providers are ranked by their guaranteed completion time, and business processes are assigned proportionally to the providers based on their completion time. (We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former schemes results are shown here.) • A strawman greedy algorithm that always assigns business processes to the service provider that has the fastest guaranteed completion time.",
                "This algorithm represents a naive approach based on greedy, local observations of each workflow without taking into consideration all workflows.",
                "In the experiments that follow, all results were averaged across 20 trials, and to help normalise the effects of randomisation used during the GA, each trial started by reading in pre-initialised data from disk.",
                "In Table 1 we list our experimental parameters.",
                "In Figure 3 we show the results of running our GA against the three candidate alternatives.",
                "The x-axis shows the number for workflows scaled up to 1000, and the y-axis shows the aggregate business value for all workflows.",
                "As can be seen, the GA consistently produces the highest business value even as the number of workflows grows; at 1000 workflows, the GA produces a 115% improvement over the next-best alternative. (Note that although we are optimising against the business value metric we defined earlier, genetic algorithms are able to converge towards the optimal value of any metric, as long as the evaluation function can consistently measure a chromosomes value with that metric.)",
                "As expected, the greedy algorithm performs very poorly because it does the worst job at balancing load: all business processes for a given service type are assigned to only one server (the one advertised to have the fastest completion time), and as more business processes arrive, the providers performance degrades linearly.",
                "The round-robin scheme is initially outperformed by the randomproportional scheme up to around 120 workflows (as shown in the magnified graph of Figure 4), but as the number of workflows increases, the round-robin scheme consistently wins over randomproportional.",
                "The reason is that although the random-proportional scheme assigns business processes to providers proportionally according to the advertised completion times (which is a measure of the power of the service provider), even the best providers will eventually reach a real-world maximum concurrency for the large -2000 -1000 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Aggregatebusinessvalueacrossallworkflows Total number of workflows Business value scores of scheduling algorithms Genetic algorithm Round robin Random proportional Greedy Figure 3: Net business value scores of different scheduling algorithms. -500 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 0 50 100 150 200Aggregatebusinessvalueacrossallworkflows Total number of workflows Business value scores of scheduling algorithms Genetic algorithm Round robin Random proportional Greedy Figure 4: Magnification of the left-most region in Figure 3. number of workflows that we are considering.",

                "Workflows comprise multiple related business processes that are <br>web service</br> consumers; here we assume that the workflows represent requested service from customers or automated systems and that the workflow has already been composed with an existing choreography toolkit.",
                "These workflows are then submitted to a portal (not shown) that acts as a scheduling agent between the <br>web service</br> consumers and the <br>web service</br> providers.",
                "In this example, a workflow could represent the actions needed to instantiate a vacation itinerary, where one business process requests booking an airline ticket, another business process requests a hotel room, and so forth.",
                "Each of these requests target a particular service type (e.g. airline reservations, hotel reservations, car reservations, etc. ), and for each service type, there are multiple instances of service providers that publish a <br>web service</br> interface.",
                "An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes, and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative business value metric for the workflow; intuitively, it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals.",
                "We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the <br>web service</br> providers and the scheduling agent such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency.",
                "The resulting problem is then to schedule and assign the business processes requests for service types to one of the service providers for that type.",
                "The scheduling must be done such that the aggregate business value across all the workflows is maximised.",
                "In Section 3 we state the scenario as a combinatorial problem and utilise a genetic search algorithm [5] to find the best assignment of <br>web service</br> requests to providers.",

                "The classic job-shop scheduling problem, shown to be NP-complete [4] [3], is similar to ours in that tasks within a job must be scheduled onto machinery (c.f. our scenario is that business processes within a workflow must be scheduled onto <br>web service</br> providers).",
                "The salient differences are that the machines can process only one job at a time (we assume servers can multi-task but with degraded performance and a maximum concurrency level), tasks within a job cannot simultaneously run on different machines (we assume business processes can be assigned to any available server), and the principal metric of performance is the makespan, which is the time for the last task among all the jobs to complete (and as we show later, optimising on the makespan is insufficient for scheduling the business processes, necessitating different metrics). 3.",
                "DESIGN In this section we describe our model and discuss how we can find scheduling assignments using a genetic search algorithm. 3.1 Model We base our model on the simplified scenario shown in Figure 1.",

                "The workflows comprise business processes, each of which makes one <br>web service</br> invocation to a service type.",
                "Further, business processes have an ordering in the workflow.",
                "The arrangement and execution of the business processes and the data flow between them are all managed by a composition or choreography tool (e.g. [1, 9]).",
                "Although composition languages can use sophisticated flow-control mechanisms such as conditional branches, for simplicity we assume the processes execute sequentially in a given order.",
                "This scenario can be naturally extended to more complex relationships that can be expressed in BPEL [7], which defines how business processes interact, messages are exchanged, activities are ordered, and exceptions are handled.",
                "Due to space constraints, we focus on the problem space presented here and will extend our model to more advanced deployment scenarios in the future.",
                "Each workflow has a QoS requirement to complete within a specified number of time units (e.g. on the order of seconds, as detailed in the Experiments section).",
                "Upon completion (or failure), the workflow is assigned a business value.",
                "We extended this approach further and considered different types of workflow completion in order to model differentiated QoS levels that can be applied by businesses (for example, to provide tiered customer service).",
                "We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement, acceptable if it completes within a constant factor κ 31 of its QoS bound (in our experiments we chose κ=3), or failing if it finishes beyond κ times its QoS bound.",
                "For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing.",
                "The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others.",
                "Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers.",
                "We assume that the providers make service level agreements (SLAs) to guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a <br>web service</br> invocation.",
                "Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load.",
                "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of <br>web service</br> requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",
                "In our experiments we vary α, β, and γ with different distributions.",
                "Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit.",
                "The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the <br>web service</br> providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.",
                "Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows, it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed.",
                "This intuitive observation suggests that traditional scheduling approaches such as round-robin or proportional assignments will not fare well, which is what we observe and discuss in Section 4.",
                "On the other hand, an exhaustive search of all the possible assignments will find the best schedule, but the computational complexity is prohibitively high.",
                "Suppose there are W workflows with an average of B business processes per workflow.",
                "Further, in the worst case each business process requests one service type, for which there are P providers.",
                "There are thus W · PB combinations to explore to find the optimal assignments of business processes to providers.",
                "Even for small configurations (e.g.",
                "W =10, B=5, P=10), the computational time for exhaustive search is significant, and in our work we look to scale these parameters.",
                "In the next subsection, discuss how a genetic search algorithm can be used to converge toward the optimum scheduling assignments. 3.2 Genetic algorithm Given an exponential search space of business process assignments to <br>web service</br> providers, the problem is to find the optimal assignment that produces the overall highest aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "To explore the solution space, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) search heuristic that simulates Darwinian natural selection by having members of a population compete to survive in order to pass their genetic chromosomes onto the next generation; after successive generations, there is a tendency for the chromosomes to converge toward the best combination [5] [6].",
                "Although other search heuristics exist that can solve optimization problems (e.g. simulated annealing or steepest-ascent hillclimbing), the business process scheduling problem fits well with a GA because potential solutions can be represented in a matrix form and allows us to use prior research in effective GA chromosome recombination to form new members of the population (e.g. [2]). 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 1 Figure 2: An example chromosome representing a scheduling assignment of (workflow,service type) → service provider.",

(We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former schemes results are shown here.) • A strawman greedy algorithm that always assigns business processes to the service provider that has the fastest guaranteed completion time.",

                "As expected, the greedy algorithm performs very poorly because it does the worst job at balancing load: all business processes for a given service type are assigned to only one server (the one advertised to have the fastest completion time), and as more business processes arrive, the providers performance degrades linearly.",

                "Although industry standards and recent research have sought to define best practices and to improve end-to-end workflow composition, one area that has not fully been explored is the scheduling of a workflows web service requests to actual service provisioning in a multi-tiered, multi-organisation environment.",

                "Because these business processes are web service consumers, service requests must be mapped and scheduled across multiple web service providers, each with its own negotiated service level agreement.",
                "In this paper we provide heuristics for scheduling service requests from multiple business process workflows to web service providers such that a business value metric across all workflows is maximised.",
                "We show that a genetic search algorithm is appropriate to perform this scheduling, and through experimentation we show that our algorithm scales well up to a thousand workflows and produces better mappings than traditional approaches.",

                "INTRODUCTION Web services can be composed into workflows to provide streamlined end-to-end functionality for human users or other systems.",
                "Although previous research efforts have looked at ways to intelligently automate the composition of web services into workflows (e.g. [1, 9]), an important remaining problem is the assignment of web service requests to the underlying web service providers in a multi-tiered runtime scenario within constraints.",
                "In this paper we address this scheduling problem and examine means to manage a large number of business process workflows in a scalable manner.",
                "The problem of scheduling web service requests to providers is relevant to modern business domains that depend on multi-tiered service provisioning.",
                "Consider the example shown in Figure 1 that illustrates our problem space.",
                "Workflows comprise multiple related business processes that are web service consumers; here we assume that the workflows represent requested service from customers or automated systems and that the workflow has already been composed with an existing choreography toolkit.",
                "These workflows are then submitted to a portal (not shown) that acts as a scheduling agent between the web service consumers and the web service providers.",
                "In this example, a workflow could represent the actions needed to instantiate a vacation itinerary, where one business process requests booking an airline ticket, another business process requests a hotel room, and so forth.",
                "Each of these requests target a particular service type (e.g. airline reservations, hotel reservations, car reservations, etc. ), and for each service type, there are multiple instances of service providers that publish a web service interface.",
                "An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes, and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative business value metric for the workflow; intuitively, it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals.",
                "We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the web service providers and the scheduling agent such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency.",
                "The resulting problem is then to schedule and assign the business processes requests for service types to one of the service providers for that type.",
                "The scheduling must be done such that the aggregate business value across all the workflows is maximised.",
                "In Section 3 we state the scenario as a combinatorial problem and utilise a genetic search algorithm [5] to find the best assignment of web service requests to providers.",
                "This approach converges towards an assignment that maximises the overall business value for all the workflows.",
                "In Section 4 we show through experimentation that this search heuristic finds better assignments than other algorithms (greedy, round-robin, and proportional).",

                "However, the provisioning techniques do not consider the challenges faced when there are alternative query execution plans and replicated data sources. [8] presents a feedback-based scheduling mechanism for multi-tiered systems with back-end databases, but unlike our work, it assumes a tighter coupling between the various components of the system.",
                "Our work also builds upon prior scheduling research.",
                "The classic job-shop scheduling problem, shown to be NP-complete [4] [3], is similar to ours in that tasks within a job must be scheduled onto machinery (c.f. our scenario is that business processes within a workflow must be scheduled onto web service providers).",
                "The salient differences are that the machines can process only one job at a time (we assume servers can multi-task but with degraded performance and a maximum concurrency level), tasks within a job cannot simultaneously run on different machines (we assume business processes can be assigned to any available server), and the principal metric of performance is the makespan, which is the time for the last task among all the jobs to complete (and as we show later, optimising on the makespan is insufficient for scheduling the business processes, necessitating different metrics). 3.",
                "DESIGN In this section we describe our model and discuss how we can find scheduling assignments using a genetic search algorithm. 3.1 Model We base our model on the simplified scenario shown in Figure 1.",
                "Specifically, we assume that users or automated systems request the execution of a workflow.",
                "The workflows comprise business processes, each of which makes one web service invocation to a service type.",
                "Further, business processes have an ordering in the workflow.",
                "The arrangement and execution of the business processes and the data flow between them are all managed by a composition or choreography tool (e.g. [1, 9]).",
                "Although composition languages can use sophisticated flow-control mechanisms such as conditional branches, for simplicity we assume the processes execute sequentially in a given order.",
                "This scenario can be naturally extended to more complex relationships that can be expressed in BPEL [7], which defines how business processes interact, messages are exchanged, activities are ordered, and exceptions are handled.",
                "Due to space constraints, we focus on the problem space presented here and will extend our model to more advanced deployment scenarios in the future.",
                "Each workflow has a QoS requirement to complete within a specified number of time units (e.g. on the order of seconds, as detailed in the Experiments section).",
                "Upon completion (or failure), the workflow is assigned a business value.",
                "We extended this approach further and considered different types of workflow completion in order to model differentiated QoS levels that can be applied by businesses (for example, to provide tiered customer service).",
                "We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement, acceptable if it completes within a constant factor κ 31 of its QoS bound (in our experiments we chose κ=3), or failing if it finishes beyond κ times its QoS bound.",
                "For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing.",
                "The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others.",
                "Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers.",
                "We assume that the providers make service level agreements (SLAs) to guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a web service invocation.",
                "Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load.",
                "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",
                "In our experiments we vary α, β, and γ with different distributions.",
                "Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit.",
                "The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.",
                "Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows, it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed.",
                "This intuitive observation suggests that traditional scheduling approaches such as round-robin or proportional assignments will not fare well, which is what we observe and discuss in Section 4.",
                "On the other hand, an exhaustive search of all the possible assignments will find the best schedule, but the computational complexity is prohibitively high.",
                "Suppose there are W workflows with an average of B business processes per workflow.",
                "Further, in the worst case each business process requests one service type, for which there are P providers.",
                "There are thus W · PB combinations to explore to find the optimal assignments of business processes to providers.",
                "Even for small configurations (e.g.",
                "W =10, B=5, P=10), the computational time for exhaustive search is significant, and in our work we look to scale these parameters.",
                "In the next subsection, discuss how a genetic search algorithm can be used to converge toward the optimum scheduling assignments. 3.2 Genetic algorithm Given an exponential search space of business process assignments to web service providers, the problem is to find the optimal assignment that produces the overall highest aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "To explore the solution space, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) search heuristic that simulates Darwinian natural selection by having members of a population compete to survive in order to pass their genetic chromosomes onto the next generation; after successive generations, there is a tendency for the chromosomes to converge toward the best combination [5] [6].",
                "Although other search heuristics exist that can solve optimization problems (e.g. simulated annealing or steepest-ascent hillclimbing), the business process scheduling problem fits well with a GA because potential solutions can be represented in a matrix form and allows us to use prior research in effective GA chromosome recombination to form new members of the population (e.g. [2]). 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 1 Figure 2: An example chromosome representing a scheduling assignment of (workflow,service type) → service provider.",

(We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former schemes results are shown here.) • A strawman greedy algorithm that always assigns business processes to the service provider that has the fastest guaranteed completion time.",
                "This algorithm represents a naive approach based on greedy, local observations of each workflow without taking into consideration all workflows.",

                "Although previous research efforts have looked at ways to intelligently automate the composition of web services into workflows (e.g. [1, 9]), an important remaining problem is the assignment of web service requests to the underlying web service providers in a multi-tiered runtime scenario within constraints.",

                "Workflows comprise multiple related business processes that are web service consumers; here we assume that the workflows represent requested service from customers or automated systems and that the workflow has already been composed with an existing choreography toolkit.",
                "These workflows are then submitted to a portal (not shown) that acts as a scheduling agent between the web service consumers and the web service providers.",
                "In this example, a workflow could represent the actions needed to instantiate a vacation itinerary, where one business process requests booking an airline ticket, another business process requests a hotel room, and so forth.",
                "Each of these requests target a particular service type (e.g. airline reservations, hotel reservations, car reservations, etc. ), and for each service type, there are multiple instances of service providers that publish a web service interface.",
                "An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes, and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative business value metric for the workflow; intuitively, it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals.",
                "We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the web service providers and the scheduling agent such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency.",
                "The resulting problem is then to schedule and assign the business processes requests for service types to one of the service providers for that type.",

                "The workflows comprise business processes, each of which makes one web service invocation to a service type.",

                "The arrangement and execution of the business processes and the data flow between them are all managed by a composition or choreography tool (e.g. [1, 9]).",
                "Although composition languages can use sophisticated flow-control mechanisms such as conditional branches, for simplicity we assume the processes execute sequentially in a given order.",
                "This scenario can be naturally extended to more complex relationships that can be expressed in BPEL [7], which defines how business processes interact, messages are exchanged, activities are ordered, and exceptions are handled.",
                "Due to space constraints, we focus on the problem space presented here and will extend our model to more advanced deployment scenarios in the future.",
                "Each workflow has a QoS requirement to complete within a specified number of time units (e.g. on the order of seconds, as detailed in the Experiments section).",
                "Upon completion (or failure), the workflow is assigned a business value.",
                "We extended this approach further and considered different types of workflow completion in order to model differentiated QoS levels that can be applied by businesses (for example, to provide tiered customer service).",
                "We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement, acceptable if it completes within a constant factor κ 31 of its QoS bound (in our experiments we chose κ=3), or failing if it finishes beyond κ times its QoS bound.",
                "For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing.",
                "The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others.",
                "Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers.",
                "We assume that the providers make service level agreements (SLAs) to guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a web service invocation.",
                "Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load.",
                "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",
                "In our experiments we vary α, β, and γ with different distributions.",
                "Ideally, all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows.",
                "However, because we model service providers with degrading performance under load, not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit: it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and cannot complete within the respective workflows QoS limit.",
                "The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.",
                "Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows, it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed.",
                "This intuitive observation suggests that traditional scheduling approaches such as round-robin or proportional assignments will not fare well, which is what we observe and discuss in Section 4.",
                "On the other hand, an exhaustive search of all the possible assignments will find the best schedule, but the computational complexity is prohibitively high.",
                "Suppose there are W workflows with an average of B business processes per workflow.",
                "Further, in the worst case each business process requests one service type, for which there are P providers.",

                "Even for small configurations (e.g.",
                "W =10, B=5, P=10), the computational time for exhaustive search is significant, and in our work we look to scale these parameters.",
                "In the next subsection, discuss how a genetic search algorithm can be used to converge toward the optimum scheduling assignments. 3.2 Genetic algorithm Given an exponential search space of business process assignments to web service providers, the problem is to find the optimal assignment that produces the overall highest aggregate business value across all workflows.",

                "Although other search heuristics exist that can solve optimization problems (e.g. simulated annealing or steepest-ascent hillclimbing), the business process scheduling problem fits well with a GA because potential solutions can be represented in a matrix form and allows us to use prior research in effective GA chromosome recombination to form new members of the population (e.g. [2]). 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 0 1 Figure 2: An example chromosome representing a scheduling assignment of (workflow,service type) → service provider.",

                "An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes, and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative business value metric for the workflow; intuitively, it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals.",
                "We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the web service providers and the scheduling agent such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency.",

                "We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement, acceptable if it completes within a constant factor κ 31 of its QoS bound (in our experiments we chose κ=3), or failing if it finishes beyond κ times its QoS bound.",
                "For each category, a business value score is assigned to the workflow, with the successful category assigned the highest positive score, followed by acceptable and then failing.",
                "The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows, further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others.",
                "Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers.",
                "We assume that the providers make service level agreements (SLAs) to guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a web service invocation.",
                "Although SLAs can be complex, in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load.",
                "This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.",
                "In our experiments we vary α, β, and γ with different distributions.",

(We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former schemes results are shown here.) • A strawman greedy algorithm that always assigns business processes to the service provider that has the fastest guaranteed completion time.",
