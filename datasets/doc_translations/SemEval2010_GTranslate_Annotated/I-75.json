Paris-Dauphine, France {bourgne,hette,maudet,pinson}@lamsade.dauphine.fr ABSTRACT We investigate the properties of a multiagent system where each (distributed) agent locally perceives its environment. Upon perception of an unexpected event, each agent locally computes its favoured hypothesis and tries to propagate it to other agents, by exchanging hypotheses and supporting arguments (observations). However, we further assume that communication opportunities are severely constrained and change dynamically. In this paper, we mostly investigate the convergence of such systems towards global consistency. We first show that (for a wide class of protocols that we shall define), the communication constraints induced by the topology will not prevent the convergence of the system, at the condition that the system dynamics guarantees that no agent will ever be isolated forever, and that agents have unlimited time for computation and arguments exchange. As this assumption cannot be made in most situations though, we then set up an experimental framework aiming at comparing the relative efficiency and effectiveness of different interaction protocols for hypotheses exchange. We study a critical situation involving a number of agents aiming at escaping from a burning building. The results reported here provide some insights regarding the design of optimal protocol for hypotheses refinement in this context. Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Multiagent systems General Terms Theory, Experimentation 1. INTRODUCTION We consider a multiagent system where each (distributed) agent locally perceives its environment, and we assume that some unexpected event occurs in that system. If each agent computes only locally its favoured hypothesis, it is only natural to assume that agents will seek to coordinate and refine their hypotheses by confronting their observations with other agents. If, in addition, the communication opportunities are severely constrained (for instance, agents can only communicate when they are close enough to some other agent), and dynamically changing (for instance, agents may change their locations), it becomes crucial to carefully design protocols that will allow agents to converge to some desired state of global consistency. In this paper we exhibit some sufficient conditions on the system dynamics and on the protocol/strategy structures that allow to guarantee that property, and we experimentally study some contexts where (some of) these assumptions are relaxed. While problems of diagnosis are among the venerable classics in the AI tradition, their multiagent counterparts have much more recently attracted some attention. Roos and colleagues [8, 9] in particular study a situation where a number of distributed entities try to come up with a satisfying global diagnosis of the whole system. They show in particular that the number of messages required to establish this global diagnosis is bound to be prohibitive, unless the communication is enhanced with some suitable protocol. However, they do not put any restrictions on agents communication options, and do not assume either that the system is dynamic. The benefits of enhancing communication with supporting information to make convergence to a desired global state of a system more efficient has often been put forward in the literature. This is for instance one of the main idea underlying the argumentation-based negotiation approach [7], where the desired state is a compromise between agents with conflicting preferences. Many of these works however make the assumption that this approach is beneficial to start with, and study the technical facets of the problem (or instead emphasize other advantages of using argumentation). Notable exceptions are the works of [3, 4, 2, 5], which studied in contexts different from ours the efficiency of argumentation. The rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 specifies the basic elements of our model, and Section 3 goes on to presenting the different protocols and strategies used by the agents to exchange hypotheses and observations. We put special attention at clearly emphasizing the conditions on the system dynamics and protocols/strategies that will be exploited in the rest of the paper. Section 4 details one of 998 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS the main results of the paper, namely the fact that under the aforementioned conditions, the constraints that we put on the topology will not prevent the convergence of the system towards global consistency, at the condition that no agent ever gets completely lost forever in the system, and that unlimited time is allowed for computation and argument exchange. While the conditions on protocols and strategies are fairly mild, it is also clear that these system requirements look much more problematic, even frankly unrealistic in critical situations where distributed approaches are precisely advocated. To get a clearer picture of the situation induced when time is a critical factor, we have set up an experimental framework that we introduce and discuss in Section 5. The critical situation involves a number of agents aiming at escaping from a burning building. The results reported here show that the effectiveness of argument exchange crucially depends upon the nature of the building, and provide some insights regarding the design of optimal protocol for hypotheses refinement in this context. 2. BASIC NOTIONS We start by defining the basic elements of our system. Environment Let O be the (potentially infinite) set of possible observations. We assume the sensors of our agents to be perfect, hence the observations to be certain. Let H be the set of hypotheses, uncertain and revisable. Let Cons(h, O) be the consistency relation, a binary relation between a hypothesis h ∈ H and a set of observations O ⊆ O. In most cases, Cons will refer to classical consistency relation, however, we may overload its meaning and add some additional properties to that relation (in which case we will mention it). The environment may include some dynamics, and change over the course of time. We define below sequences of time points to deal with it: Definition 1 (Sequence of time points). A sequence of time points t1, t2, . . . , tn from t is an ordered set of time points t1, t2, . . . , tn such that t1 ≥ t and ∀i ∈ [1, n − 1], ti+1 ≥ ti. Agent We take a system populated by n agents a1, . . . , an. Each agent is defined as a tuple F, Oi, hi , where: • F, the set of facts, common knowledge to all agents. • Oi ∈ 2O , the set of observations made by the agent so far. We assume a perfect memory, hence this set grows monotonically. • hi ∈ H, the favourite hypothesis of the agent. A key notion governing the formation of hypotheses is that of consistency, defined below: Definition 2 (Consistency). We say that: • An agent is consistent (Cons(ai)) iff Cons(hi, Oi) (that is, its hypothesis is consistent with its observation set). • An agent ai consistent with a partner agent aj iff Cons(ai) and Cons(hi, Oj) (that is, this agent is consistent and its hypothesis can explain the observation set of the other agent). • Two agents ai and aj are mutually consistent (MCons(ai, aj)) iff Cons(ai, aj) and Cons(aj, ai). • A system is consistent iff ∀(i, j)∈[1, n]2 it is the case that MCons(ai, aj). To ensure its consistency, each agent is equipped with an abstract reasoning machinery that we shall call the explanation function Eh. This (deterministic) function takes a set of observation and returns a single prefered hypothesis (2O → H). We assume h = Eh(O) to be consistent with O by definition of Eh, so using this function on its observation set to determine its favourite hypothesis is a sure way for the agent to achieve consistency. Note however that an hypothesis does not need to be generated by Eh to be consistent with an observation set. As a concrete example of such a function, and one of the main inspiration of this work, one can cite the Theorist reasoning system [6] -as long as it is coupled with a filter selecting a single prefered theory among the ones initially selected by Theorist. Note also that hi may only be modified as a consequence of the application Eh. We refer to this as the autonomy of the agent: no other agent can directly impose a given hypothesis to an agent. As a consequence, only a new observation (being it a new perception, or an observation communicated by a fellow agent) can result in a modification of its prefered hypothesis hi (but not necessarily of course). We finally define a property of the system that we shall use in the rest of the paper: Definition 3 (Bounded Perceptions). A system involves a bounded perception for agents iff ∃n0 s.t. ∀t| ∪N i=1 Oi| ≤ n0. (That is, the number of observations to be made by the agents in the system is not infinite.) Agent Cycle Now we need to see how these agents will evolve and interact in their environment. In our context, agents evolve in a dynamic environment, and we classicaly assume the following system cycle: 1. Environment dynamics: the environment evolves according to the defined rules of the system dynamics. 2. Perception step : agents get perceptions from the environment. These perceptions are typically partial (e.g. the agent can only see a portion of a map). 3. Reasoning step: agents compare perception with predictions, seek explanations for (potential) difference(s), refine their hypothesis, draw new conclusions. 4. Communication step: agents can communicate hypotheses and observations with other agents through a defined protocol. Any agent can only be involved in one communication with another agent by step. 5. Action step: agents do some practical reasoning using the models obtained from the previous steps and select an action. They can then modify the environment by executing it. The communication of the agents will be further constrained by topological consideration. At a given time, an agent will only be able to communicate with a number of neighbours. Its connexions with these others agents may The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 999 evolve with its situation in the environment. Typically, an agent can only communicate with agents that it can sense, but one could imagine evolving topological constraints on communication based on a network of communications between agents where the links are not always active. Communication In our system, agents will be able to communicate with each other. However, due to the aforementionned topological constraints, they will not be able to communicate with any agents at anytime. Who an agent can communicate with will be defined dynamically (for instance, this can be a consequence of the agents being close enough to get in touch). We will abstractly denote by C(ai, aj, t) the communication property, in other words, the fact that agents ai and aj can communicate at time t (note that this relation is assumed to be symetric, but of course not transitive). We are now in a position to define two essential properties of our system. Definition 4 (Temporal Path). There exists a temporal communication path at horizon tf (noted Ltf (aI , aJ )) between ai and aj iff there exists a sequence of time points t1, t2, . . . , tn from tf and a sequence of agents k1, k2, . . . , kn s.t. (i) C(aI , ak1 , t1), (ii) C(akn , aJ , tn+1), (iii) ∀i ∈ [1, n], C(aki , aki+1 , ti) Intuitively, what this property says is that it is possible to find a temporal path in the future that would allow to link agent ai and aj via a sequence of intermediary agents. Note that the time points are not necessarily successive, and that the sequence of agents may involve the same agents several times. Definition 5 (Temporal Connexity). A system is temporaly connex iff ∀t ∀(i, j)∈[1, n]2 Lt(ai, aj) In short, a temporaly connex system guarantees that any agent will be able to communicate with any other agents, no matter how long it might take to do so, at any time. To put it another way, it is never the case that an agent will be isolated for ever from another agent of the system. We will next discuss the detail of how communication concretely takes place in our system. Remember that in this paper, we only consider the case of bilateral exchanges (an agent can only speak to a single other agent), and that we also assume that any agent can only engage in a single exchange in a given round. 3. PROTOCOLS AND STRATEGIES In this section, we discuss the requirements of the interaction protocols that govern the exchange of messages between agents, and provide some example instantiation of such protocols. To clarify the presentation, we distinguish two levels: the local level, which is concerned with the regulation of bilateral exchanges; and the global level,which essentially regulates the way agents can actually engage into a conversation. At each level, we separate what is specified by the protocol, and what is left to agents strategies. Local Protocol and Strategies We start by inspecting local protocols and strategies that will regulate the communication between the agents of the system. As we limit ourselves to bilateral communication, these protocols will simply involve two agents. Such protocol will have to meet one basic requirement to be satisfying. • consistency (CONS)- a local protocol has to guarantee the mutual consistency of agents upon termination (which implies termination of course). Figure 1: A Hypotheses Exchange Protocol [1] One example such protocol is the protocol described in [1] that is pictured in Fig. 1. To further illustrate how such protocol can be used by agents, we give some details on a possible strategy: upon receiving a hypothesis h1 (propose(h1) or counterpropose(h1)) from a1, agent a2 is in state 2 and has the following possible replies: counterexample (if the agent knows an example contradicting the hypothesis, or not explained by this hypothesis), challenge (if the agents lacks evidence to accept this hypothesis), counterpropose (if the agent agrees with the hypothesis but prefers another one), or accept (if it is indeed as good as its favourite hypothesis). This strategy guarantees, among other properties, the eventual mutual logical consistency of the involved agents [1]. Global Protocol The global protocol regulates the way bilateral exchanges will be initiated between agents. At each turn, agents will concurrently send one weighted request to communicate to other agents. This weight is a value measuring the agents willingness to converse with the targeted agent (in practice, this can be based on different heuristics, but we shall make some assumptions on agents strategies, see below). Sending such a request is a kind of conditional commitment for the agent. An agent sending a weighted request commits to engage in conversation with the target if he does not receive and accept himself another request. Once all request have been received, each agent replies with either an acccept or a reject. By answering with an accept, an agent makes a full commitment to engage in conversation with the sender. Therefore, it can only send one accept in a given round, as an agent can only participate in one conversation per time step. When all response have been received, each agent receiving an accept can either initiate a conversation using the local protocol or send a cancel if it has accepted another request. At the end of all the bilateral exchanges, the agents engaged in conversation are discarded from the protocol. Then each of the remaining agents resends a request and the process iterates until no more requests are sent. Global Strategy We now define four requirements for the strategies used by agents, depending on their role in the protocol: two are concerned with the requestee role (how to decide who the 1000 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) agent wishes to communicate with?), the other two with the responder role (how to decide which communication request to accept or not?). • Willingness to solve inconsistancies (SOLVE)-agents want to communicate with any other agents unless they know they are mutually consistent. • Focus on solving inconsistencies (FOCUS)-agents do not request communication with an agent with whom they know they are mutually consistent. • Willingness to communicate (COMM)-agents cannot refuse a weighted communication request, unless they have just received or send a request with a greater weight. • Commitment to communication request (REQU)agents cannot accept a weighted communication request if they have themselves sent a communication request with a greater weight. Therefore, they will not cancel their request unless they have received a communicational request with greater weight. Now the protocol structure, together with the properties COMM+REQU, ensure that a request can only be rejected if its target agent engages in communication with another agent. Suppose indeed that agent ai wants to communicate with aj by sending a request with weight w. COMM guarantees that an agent receiving a weighted request will either accept this communication, accept a communication with a greater weight or wait for the answer to a request with a greater weight. This ensures that the request with maximal weight will be accepted and not cancelled (as REQU ensures that an agent sending a request can only cancel it if he accepts another request with greater weight). Therefore at least two agents will engage in conversation per round of the global protocol. As the protocol ensures that ai can resend its request while aj is not engaged in a conversation, there will be a turn in which aj must engage in a conversation, either with ai or another agent. These requirements concern request sending and acceptation, but agents also need some strategy of weight attribution. We describe below an altruist strategy, used in our experiments. Being cooperative, an agent may want to know more of the communication wishes of other agents in order to improve the overall allocation of exchanges to agents. A context request step is then added to the global protocol. Before sending their chosen weighted request, agents attribute a weight to all agents they are prepared to communicate with, according to some internal factors. In the simplest case, this weight will be 1 for all agent with whom the agent is not sure of being mutually consistent (ensuring SOLVE), other agent being not considered for communication (ensuring FOCUS). The agent then sends a context request to all agents with whom communication is considered. This request also provides information about the sender (list of considered communications along with their weight). After reception of all the context requests, agents will either reply with a deny, iff they are already engaged in a conversation (in which case, the requesting agent will not consider communication with them anymore in this turn), or an inform giving the requester information about the requests it has sent and received. When all replies have been received, each agent can calculate the weight of all requests concerning it. It does so by substracting from the weight of its request the weight of all requests concerning either it or its target (that is, the final weight of the request from ai to aj is Wi,j = wi,j +wj,i − ( P k∈R(i)−{j} wi,k + P k∈S(i)−{j} wk,i + P k∈R(j)−{i} wj,k + P k∈S(j)−{i} wk,j) where wi,j is the weight of the request of ai to aj, R(i) is the set of indice of agents having received a request from ai and S(i) is the set of indice of agents having send a request to ai). It then finally sends a weighted request to the agents who maximise this weight (or wait for a request) as described in the global protocol. 4. (CONDITIONAL) CONVERGENCE TO GLOBAL CONSISTENCY In this section we will show that the requirements regarding protocols and strategies just discussed will be sufficient to ensure that the system will eventually converge towards global consistency, under some conditions. We first show that, if two agents are not mutually consistent at some time, then there will be necessarily a time in the future such that an agent will learn a new observation, being it because it is new for the system, or by learning it from another agent. Lemma 1. Let S be a system populated by n agents a1, a2, ..., an, temporaly connex, and involving bounded perceptions for these agents. Let n1 be the sum of cardinalities of the intersection of pairwise observation sets. (n1 = P (i,j)∈[1,n]2 |Oi ∩ Oj|) Let n2 be the cardinality of the union of all agents observations sets. (n2 = | ∪N i=1 Oi|). If ¬MCons(ai, aj) at time t0, there is necessarily a time t > t0 s.t. either n1 or n2 will increase. Proof. Suppose that there exist a time t0 and indices (i, j) s.t. ¬MCons(ai, aj). We will use mt0 = P (k,l)∈[1,n]2 εComm(ak, al, t0) where εComm(ak, al, t0) = 1 if ak and al have communicated at least once since t0, and 0 otherwise. Temporal connexity guarantees that there exist t1, ..., tm+1 and k1, ..., km s.t. C(ai, ak1 , t1), C(akm , aj, tm+1), and ∀p ∈ [1, m], C(akp , akp+1 , tp). Clearly, if MCons(ai, ak1 ), MCons(akm , aj) and ∀p, MCons(akp , akp+1 ), we have MCons(ai, aj) which contradicts our hypothesis (MCons being transitive, MCons(ai, ak1 )∧MCons(ak1 , ak2 ) implies that MCons(ai, ak2 ) and so on till MCons(ai, akm )∧ MCons(akm , aj) which implies MCons(ai, aj) ). At least two agents are then necessarily inconsistent (¬MCons(ai, ak1 ), or ¬MCons(akm , aj), or ∃p0 t.q. ¬MCons(akp0 , akp0+1 )). Let ak and al be these two neighbours at a time t > t0 1 . The SOLVE property ensures that either ak or al will send a communication request to the other agent at time t . As shown before, this in turn ensures that at least one of these agents will be involved in a communication. Then there are two possibilities: (case i) ak and al communicate at time t . In this case, we know that ¬MCons(ak, al). This and the CONS property ensures that at least one of the agents must change its 1 Strictly speaking, the transitivity of MCons only ensure that ak and al are inconsistent at a time t ≥ t0 that can be different from the time t at which they can communicate. But if they become consistent between t and t (or inconsistent between t and t ), it means that at least one of them have changed its hypothesis between t and t , that is, after t0. We can then apply the reasoning of case iib. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1001 hypothesis, which in turn, since agents are autonomous, implies at least one exchange of observation. But then |Ok ∩Ol| is bound to increase: n1(t ) > n1(t0). (case ii) ak communicates with ap at time t . We then have again two possibilities: (case iia) ak and ap did not communicate since t0. But then εComm(ak, ap, t0) had value 0 and takes value 1. Hence mt0 increases. (case iib) ak and ap did communicate at some time t0 > t0. The CONS property of the protocol ensures that MCons(ak, ap) at that time. Now the fact that they communicate and FOCUS implies that at least one of them did change its hypothesis in the meantime. The fact that agents are autonomous implies in turn that a new observation (perceived or received from another agent) necessarily provoked this change. The latter case would ensure the existence of a time t > t0 and an agent aq s.t. either |Op ∩Oq| or |Ok ∩Oq| increases of 1 at that time (implying n1(t ) > n1(t0)). The former case means that the agent gets a new perception o at time t . If that observation was unknown in the system before, then n2(t ) > n2(t0). If some agent aq already knew this observation before, then either Op ∩ Oq or Ok ∩ Oq increases of 1 at time t (which implies that n1(t ) > n1(t0)). Hence, ¬MCons(ai, aj) at time t0 guarantees that, either: −∃t > t0 t.q. n1(t ) > n1(t0); or −∃t > t0 t.q. n2(t ) > n2(t0); or −∃t > t0 t.q. mt0 increases of 1 at time t . By iterating the reasoning with t (but keeping t0 as the time reference for mt0 ), we can eliminate the third case (mt0 is integer and bounded by n2 , which means that after a maximum of n2 iterations, we necessarily will be in one of two other cases.) As a result, we have proven that if ¬MCons(ai, aj) at time t0, there is necessarily a time t s.t. either n1 or n2 will increase. Theorem 1 (Global consistency). Let S be a system populated by n agents a1, a2, ..., an, temporaly connex, and involving bounded perceptions for these agents. Let Cons(ai, aj) be a transitive consistency property. Then any protocol and strategies satisfying properties CONS, SOLVE, FOCUS, COMM and REQU guarantees that the system will converge towards global consistency. Proof. For the sake of contradiction, let us assume ∃I, J ∈ [1, N] s.t. ∀t, ∃t0 > t, t.q. ¬Cons(aI , aJ , t0). Using the lemma, this implies that ∃t > t0 s.t. either n1(t ) > n1(t0) or n2(t ) > n2(t0). But we can apply the same reasoning taking t = t , which would give us t1 > t > t0 s.t. ¬Cons(aI , aJ , t1), which gives us t > t1 s.t. either n1(t ) > n1(t1) or n2(t ) > n2(t1). By successive iterations we can then construct a sequence t0, t1, ..., tn, which can be divided in two sub-sequences t0, t1, ...tn and t0 , t1 , ..., tn s.t. n1(t0) < n1(t1) < ... < n1(tn) and n2(t0 ) < n2(t1 ) < ... < n2(tn). One of these sub-sequences has to be infinite. However, n1(ti) and n2(ti ) are strictly growing, integer, and bounded, which implies that both are finite. Contradiction. What the previous result essentially shows is that, in a system where no agent will be isolated from the rest of the agents for ever, only very mild assumptions on the protocols and strategies used by agents suffice to guarantee convergence towards system consistency in a finite amount of time (although it might take very long). Unfortunately, in many critical situations, it will not be possible to assume this temporal connexity. As distributed approaches as the one advocated in this paper are precisely often presented as a good way to tackle problems of reliability or problems of dependence to a center that are of utmost importance in these critical applications, it is certainly interesting to further explore how such a system would behave when we relax this assumption. 5. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY This experiment involves agents trying to escape from a burning building. The environment is described as a spatial grid with a set of walls and (thankfully) some exits. Time and space are considered discrete. Time is divided in rounds. Agents are localised by their position on the spatial grid. These agents can move and communicate with other agents. In a round, an agent can move of one cell in any of the four cardinal directions, provided it is not blocked by a wall. In this application, agents communicate with any other agent (but, recall, a single one) given that this agent is in view, and that they have not yet exchanged their current favoured hypothesis. Suddenly, a fire erupts in these premises. From this moment, the fire propagates. Each round, for each cases where there is fire, the fire propagates in the four directions. However, the fire cannot propagate through a wall. If the fire propagates in a case where an agent is positioned, that agent burns and is considered dead. It can of course no longer move nor communicate. If an agent gets to an exit, it is considered saved, and can no longer be burned. Agents know the environment and the rules governing the dynamics of this environment, that is, they know the map as well as the rules of fire propagation previously described. They also locally perceive this environment, but cannot see further than 3 cases away, in any direction. Walls also block the line of view, preventing agents from seeing behind them. Within their sight, they can see other agents and whether or not the cases they see are on fire. All these perceptions are memorised. We now show how this instantiates the abstract framework presented the paper. • O = {Fire(x, y, t), NoFire(x, y, t), Agent(ai, x, y, t)} Observations can then be positive (o ∈ P(O) iff ∃h ∈ H s.t. h |= o) or negative (o ∈ N(O) iff ∃h ∈ H s.t. h |= ¬o). • H={FireOrigin(x1, y1, t1)∧...∧FireOrigin(xl, yl, tl)} Hypotheses are conjunctions of FireOrigins. • Cons(h, O) consistency relation satisfies: - coherence : ∀o ∈ N(O), h |= ¬o. - completeness : ∀o ∈ P(O), h |= o. - minimality : For all h ∈ H, if h is coherent and complete for O, then h is prefered to h according to the preference relation (h ≤p h ).2 2 Selects first the minimal number of origins, then the most recent (least preemptive strategy [6]), then uses some arbitrary fixed ranking to discriminate ex-aequo. The resulting relation is a total order, hence minimality implies that there will be a single h s.t.Cons(O, h) for a given O. This in turn means that MCons(ai, aj) iff Cons(ai), Cons(aj), and hi = hj. This relation is then transitive and symmetric. 1002 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) • Eh takes O as argument and returns min≤p of the coherent and complete hypothesis for O 5.1 Experimental Evaluation We will classically (see e.g. [3, 4]) assess the effectiveness and efficiency of different interaction protocols. Effectiveness of a protocol The proportion of agents surviving the fire over the initial number of agents involved in the experiment will determine the effectiveness of a given protocol. If this value is high, the protocol has been effective to propagate the information and/or for the agents to refine their hypotheses and determine the best way to the exit. Efficiency of a protocol Typically, the use of supporting information will involve a communication overhead. We will assume here that the efficiency of a given protocol is characterised by the data flow induced by this protocol. In this paper we will only discuss this aspect wrt. local protocols. The main measure that we shall then use here is the mean total size of messages that are exchanged by agents per exchange (hence taking into account both the number of messages and the actual size of the messages, because it could be that messages happen to be very big, containing e.g. a large number of observations, which could counter-balance a low number of messages). 5.2 Experimental Settings The chosen experimental settings are the following: • Environmental topology- Performances of information propagation are highly constrained by the environment topology. The perception skills of the agents depend on the openness of the environment. With a large number of walls the perceptions of agents are limited, and also the number of possible inter-agent communications, whereas an open environment will provide optimal possibilities of perception and information propagation. Thus, we propose a topological index (see below) as a common basis to charaterize the environments (maps) used during experimentations. The topological index (TI) is the ratio of the number of cells that can be perceived by agents summed up from all possible positions, divided by the number of cells that would be perceived from the same positions but without any walls. (The closer to 1, the more open the environment). We shall also use two additional, more classical [10], measures: the characteristic path length3 (CPL) and the clustering coefficient4 (CC). • Number of agents- The propagation of information also depends on the initial number of agents involved during an experimentation. For instance, the more agents, the more potential communications there is. This means that there will be more potential for propagation, but also that the bilateral exchange restriction will be more crucial. 3 The CPL is the median of the means of the shortest path lengths connecting each node to all other nodes. 4 characterising the isolation degree of a region of an environment in terms of acessibility (number of roads still usable to reach this region).

Figure 2: Two maps (left: TI=69%, right TI=38%) We designed three different maps for each index (Fig. 2 shows two of them), containing the same maximum number of agents (36 agents max.) with a maximum density of one agent per cell, the same number of exits and a similar fire origin (e.g. starting time and position). The three differents maps of a given index are designed as follows. The first map is a model of an existing building floor. The second map has the same enclosure, exits and fire origin as the first one, but the number and location of walls are different (wall locations are designed by an heuristic which randomly creates walls on the spatial grid such that no fully closed rooms are created and that no exit is closed). The third map is characterised by geometrical enclosure in wich walls location is also designed with the aforementioned heuristic. Table 1 summarizes the different topological measures characterizing these different maps. It is worth pointing out that the values confirm the relevance of TI (maps with a high TI have a low CPL and a high CC. However the CPL and CC allows to further refine the difference between the maps, e.g. between 53-1 and 53-2). 5.4 Experimental Results For each triple of maps defined as above we conduct the same experiments. In each experiment, the society differs in terms of its initial proportion of involved agents, from 1% to 100%. This initial proportion represents the percentage of involved agents with regards to the possible maximum number of agents. For each map and each initial proportion, The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1003 we select randomly 100 different initial agents locations. For each of those different locations we execute the system one time for each different interaction protocol. Effectiveness of Communication and Argumentation The first experiment that we set up aims at testing how effective is hypotheses exchange (HE), and in particular how the topological aspects will affect this effectiveness. In order to do so, we have computed the ratio of improvement offered by that protocol over a situation where agents could simply not communicate (no comm). To get further insights as to what extent the hypotheses exchange was really crucial, we also tested a much less elaborated protocol consisting of mere observation exchanges (OE). More precisely, this protocol requires that each agent stores any unexpected observation that it perceives, and agents simply exchange their respective lists of observations when they discuss. In this case, the local protocol is different (note in particular that it does not guarantee mutual consistency), but the global protocol remains the same (at the only exception that agents motivation to communicate is to synchronise their list of observations, not their hypothesis). If this protocol is at best as effective as HE, it has the advantage of being more efficient (this is obvious wrt the number of messages which will be limited to 2, less straightforward as far as the size of messages is concerned, but the rough observation that the exchange of observations can be viewed as a flat version of the challenge is helpful to see this). The results of these experiments are reported in Fig. 3. Figure 3: Comparative effectiveness ratio gain of protocols when the proportion of agents augments The first observation that needs to be made is that communication improves the effectiveness of the process, and this ratio increases as the number of agents grows in the system. The second lesson that we learn here is that closeness relatively makes communication more effective over non communication. Maps exhibiting a T.I. of 38% are constantly above the two others, and 53% are still slightly but significantly better than 69%. However, these curves also suggest, perhaps surprisingly, that HE outperforms OE in precisely those situations where the ratio gain is less important (the only noticeable difference occurs for rather open maps where T.I. is 69%). This may be explained as follows: when a map is open, agents have many potential explanation candidates, and argumentation becomes useful to discriminate between those. When a map is labyrinth-like, there are fewer possible explanations to an unexpected event. Importance of the Global Protocol The second set of experiments seeks to evaluate the importance of the design of the global protocol. We tested our protocol against a local broadcast (LB) protocol. Local broadcast means that all the neighbours agents perceived by an agent will be involved in a communication with that agent in a given round -we alleviate the constraint of a single communication by agent. This gives us a rough upper bound upon the possible ratio gain in the system (for a given local protocol). Again, we evaluated the ratio gain induced by that LB over our classical HE, for the three different classes of maps. The results are reported in Fig. 4. Figure 4: Ratio gain of local broadcast over hypotheses exchange Note to begin with that the ratio gain is 0 when the proportion of agents is 5%, which is easily explained by the fact that it corresponds to situations involving only two agents. We first observe that all classes of maps witness a ratio gain increasing when the proportion of agents augments: the gain reaches 10 to 20%, depending on the class of maps considered. If one compares this with the improvement reported in the previous experiment, it appears to be of the same magnitude. This illustrates that the design of the global protocol cannot be ignored, especially when the proportion of agents is high. However, we also note that the effectiveness ratio gain curves have very different shapes in both cases: the gain induced by the accuracy of the local protocol increases very quickly with the proportion of agents, while the curve is really smooth for the global one. Now let us observe more carefully the results reported here: the curve corresponding to a TI of 53% is above that corresponding to 38%. This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast). However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%. This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3). A simple rule of thumb could be that when the number of agents is small, special attention should be put on the local 1004 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) protocol, whereas when that number is large, one should carefully design the global one (unless the map is so open that the protocol is already almost optimally efficient). Efficiency of the Protocols The final experiment reported here is concerned with the analysis of the efficiency of the protocols. We analysis here the mean size of the totality of the messages that are exchanged by agents (mean size of exchanges, for short) using the following protocols: HE, OE, and two variant protocols. The first one is an intermediary restricted hypotheses exchange protocol (RHE). RHE is as follows: it does not involve any challenge nor counter-propose, which means that agents cannot switch their role during the protocol (this differs from RE in that respect). In short, RHE allows an agent to exhaust its partners criticism, and eventually this partner will come to adopt the agents hypothesis. Note that this means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here (as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness. The second variant protocol is a complete observation exchange protocol (COE). COE uses the same principles as OE, but includes in addition all critical negative examples (nofire) in the exchange (thus giving all examples used as arguments by the hypotheses exchanges protocol), hence improving effectiveness. Results for map 69-1 are shown on Fig. 5. Figure 5: Mean size of exchanges First we can observe the fact that the ordering of the protocols, from the least efficient to the most efficient, is COE, HE, RHE and then OE. HE being more efficient than COE proves that the argumentation process gains efficiency by selecting when it is needed to provide negative example, which have less impact that positive ones in our specific testbed. However, by communicating hypotheses before eventually giving observation to support it (HE) instead of directly giving the most crucial observations (OE), the argumentation process doubles the size of data exchanges. It is the cost for ensuring consistency at the end of the exchange (a property that OE does not support). Also significant is the fact the the mean size of exchanges is slightly higher when the number of agents is small. This is explained by the fact that in these cases only a very few agents have relevant informations in their possession, and that they will need to communicate a lot in order to come up with a common view of the situation. When the number of agents increases, this knowledge is distributed over more agents which need shorter discussions to get to mutual consistency. As a consequence, the relative gain in efficiency of using RHE appears to be better when the number of agents is small: when it is high, they will hardly argue anyway. Finally, it is worth noticing that the standard deviation for these experiments is rather high, which means that the conversation do not converge to any stereotypic pattern. 6. CONCLUSION This paper has investigated the properties of a multiagent system where each (distributed) agent locally perceives its environment, and tries to reach consistency with other agents despite severe communication restrictions. In particular we have exhibited conditions allowing convergence, and experimentally investigated a typical situation where those conditions cannot hold. There are many possible extensions to this work, the first being to further investigate the properties of different global protocols belonging to the class we identified, and their influence on the outcome. There are in particular many heuristics, highly dependent on the context of the study, that could intuitively yield interesting results (in our study, selecting the recipient on the basis of what can be inferred from his observed actions could be such a heuristic). One obvious candidate for longer term issues concern the relaxation of the assumption of perfect sensing. 7. REFERENCES [1] G. Bourgne, N. Maudet, and S. Pinson.

Introducción Consideramos un sistema multiagente donde cada agente (distribuido) local percibe localmente su entorno, y suponemos que se produce algún evento inesperado en ese sistema. Si cada agente calcula solo localmente su hipótesis favorecida, es natural suponer que los agentes buscarán coordinar y refinar sus hipótesis enfrentando sus observaciones con otros agentes. Si, además, las oportunidades de comunicación están severamente limitadas (por ejemplo, los agentes solo pueden comunicarse cuando están lo suficientemente cerca de algún otro agente), y cambian dinámicamente (por ejemplo, los agentes pueden cambiar sus ubicaciones), se vuelve crucial diseñar cuidadosamenteProtocolos que permitirán a los agentes converger a algún estado deseado de consistencia global. En este documento, exhibimos algunas condiciones suficientes en la dinámica del sistema y en las estructuras de protocolo/estrategia que permiten garantizar esa propiedad, y estudiamos experimentalmente algunos contextos en los que (algunas de) estos supuestos son relajados. Si bien los problemas de diagnóstico se encuentran entre los venerables clásicos en la tradición de la IA, sus contrapartes multiagentes han atraído mucho más atención. Roos y sus colegas [8, 9] en particular estudian una situación en la que varias entidades distribuidas intentan encontrar un diagnóstico global satisfactorio de todo el sistema. Muestran en particular que el número de mensajes requeridos para establecer este diagnóstico global seguramente será prohibitivo, a menos que la comunicación mejore con algún protocolo adecuado. Sin embargo, no ponen ninguna restricción a las opciones de comunicación de los agentes, y no asumen que el sistema sea dinámico. Los beneficios de mejorar la comunicación con la información de apoyo para hacer convergencia a un estado global deseado de un sistema más eficiente a menudo se han presentado en la literatura. Esta es, por ejemplo, una de las ideas principales que subyace al enfoque de negociación basado en la argumentación [7], donde el estado deseado es un compromiso entre agentes con preferencias conflictivas. Sin embargo, muchos de estos trabajos suponen que este enfoque es beneficioso para comenzar y estudia las facetas técnicas del problema (o enfatizan otras ventajas de usar la argumentación). Las excepciones notables son las obras de [3, 4, 2, 5], que estudiaron en contextos diferentes de los nuestros la eficiencia de la argumentación. El resto del trabajo es la siguiente. La Sección 2 especifica los elementos básicos de nuestro modelo, y la Sección 3 continúa presentando los diferentes protocolos y estrategias utilizadas por los agentes para intercambiar hipótesis y observaciones. Pusimos especial atención al enfatizar claramente las condiciones en la dinámica del sistema y los protocolos/estrategias que serán explotadas en el resto del documento. Sección 4 Detalles uno de 998 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 Ifaamas Los principales resultados del documento, a saber, el hecho de que bajo las condiciones mencionadas anteriormente, las limitaciones que ponemos en la topología no evitarán la convergenciadel sistema hacia la consistencia global, con la condición de que ningún agente se pierda por completo para siempre en el sistema, y que el tiempo ilimitado está permitido para el intercambio y el intercambio de argumentos. Si bien las condiciones en protocolos y estrategias son bastante suaves, también está claro que estos requisitos del sistema se ven mucho más problemáticos, incluso francamente poco realistas en situaciones críticas donde los enfoques distribuidos se defienden con precisión. Para obtener una imagen más clara de la situación inducida cuando el tiempo es un factor crítico, hemos establecido un marco experimental que presentamos y discutimos en la Sección 5. La situación crítica involucra a una serie de agentes que apuntan a escapar de un edificio en llamas. Los resultados informados aquí muestran que la efectividad del intercambio de argumentos depende de manera crucial de la naturaleza del edificio y proporciona algunas ideas sobre el diseño de un protocolo óptimo para el refinamiento de hipótesis en este contexto.2. Nociones básicas comenzamos definiendo los elementos básicos de nuestro sistema. El medio ambiente es el conjunto (potencialmente infinito) de posibles observaciones. Asumimos que los sensores de nuestros agentes son perfectos, de ahí las observaciones para estar seguras. Sea h el conjunto de hipótesis, inciertas y revisables. Sea los contras (h, o) la relación de consistencia, una relación binaria entre una hipótesis h ∈ H y un conjunto de observaciones O ⊆ O. En la mayoría de los casos, los contras se referirán a la relación de consistencia clásica, sin embargo, podemos sobrecargar su significado y agregar algunas propiedades adicionales a esa relación (en cuyo caso lo mencionaremos). El entorno puede incluir algunas dinámicas y cambiar a lo largo del tiempo. Definimos a continuación secuencias de puntos de tiempo para tratarlo: Definición 1 (secuencia de puntos de tiempo). Una secuencia de puntos de tiempo T1, T2 ,..., TN de T es un conjunto ordenado de puntos de tiempo T1, T2 ,..., tn tal que t1 ≥ t y ∀i ∈ [1, n - 1], ti+1 ≥ ti. Agente tomamos un sistema poblado por N Agents A1 ,..., un. Cada agente se define como una tupla f, oi, hola, donde: • f, el conjunto de hechos, conocimiento común para todos los agentes.• Oi ∈ 2o, el conjunto de observaciones hechas por el agente hasta ahora. Asumimos un recuerdo perfecto, por lo tanto, este conjunto crece monotónicamente.• Hola ∈ H, la hipótesis favorita del agente. Una noción clave que rige la formación de hipótesis es la de consistencia, definida a continuación: Definición 2 (consistencia). Decimos que: • Un agente es consistente (contras (AI)) Iff Cons (HI, OI) (es decir, su hipótesis es consistente con su conjunto de observación).• Un agente AI consistente con un agente asociado AJ IFF Contras (AI) y contras (HI, OJ) (es decir, este agente es consistente y su hipótesis puede explicar el conjunto de observación del otro agente).• Dos agentes AI y AJ son mutuamente consistentes (McONS (AI, AJ)) IFF Contras (AI, AJ) y contras (AJ, AI).• Un sistema es consistente IFF ∀ (i, j) ∈ [1, n] 2 Es el caso que McONS (AI, AJ). Para garantizar su consistencia, cada agente está equipado con una maquinaria de razonamiento abstracta que llamaremos la función de explicación eh. Esta función (determinista) toma un conjunto de observación y devuelve una única hipótesis preferida (2o → h). Suponemos que H = Eh (O) es consistente con O por definición de EH, por lo que usar esta función en su conjunto de observación para determinar su hipótesis favorita es una forma segura para que el agente alcance la consistencia. Sin embargo, tenga en cuenta que EH no necesita generar una hipótesis para ser consistente con un conjunto de observación. Como ejemplo concreto de dicha función, y una de las principales inspiración de este trabajo, se puede citar el sistema de razonamiento teórico [6], siempre que se combine con un filtro que selecciona una sola teoría preferida entre los seleccionados inicialmente porTeórico. Tenga en cuenta también que HI solo puede modificarse como consecuencia de la aplicación EH. Nos referimos a esto como la autonomía del agente: ningún otro agente puede imponer directamente una hipótesis dada a un agente. Como consecuencia, solo una nueva observación (ya que es una nueva percepción, o una observación comunicada por un compañero agente) puede resultar en una modificación de su hipótesis preferida HI (pero no necesariamente, por supuesto). Finalmente definimos una propiedad del sistema que usaremos en el resto del documento: Definición 3 (percepciones limitadas). Un sistema involucra una percepción limitada para los agentes IFF ∃n0 S.T.∀T |∪n i = 1 oi |≤ n0.(Es decir, el número de observaciones que deben hacer los agentes en el sistema no es infinito). Ciclo del agente Ahora necesitamos ver cómo estos agentes evolucionarán e interactuarán en su entorno. En nuestro contexto, los agentes evolucionan en un entorno dinámico, y clásicos asumimos el siguiente ciclo del sistema: 1. Dinámica del entorno: el entorno evoluciona de acuerdo con las reglas definidas de la dinámica del sistema.2. Paso de percepción: los agentes obtienen percepciones del medio ambiente. Estas percepciones son típicamente parciales (por ejemplo, el agente solo puede ver una parte de un mapa).3. Paso de razonamiento: los agentes comparan la percepción con las predicciones, buscan explicaciones sobre la (s) diferencia (s) (s) (s) potencial), refinan su hipótesis, saca nuevas conclusiones.4. Paso de comunicación: los agentes pueden comunicar hipótesis y observaciones con otros agentes a través de un protocolo definido. Cualquier agente solo puede participar en una comunicación con otro agente por paso.5. Paso de acción: los agentes hacen algún razonamiento práctico utilizando los modelos obtenidos de los pasos anteriores y seleccionan una acción. Luego pueden modificar el entorno ejecutándolo. La comunicación de los agentes se verá más limitada por la consideración topológica. En un momento dado, un agente solo podrá comunicarse con varios vecinos. Sus conexiones con estos otros agentes pueden el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 999 evolucionan con su situación en el medio ambiente. Por lo general, un agente solo puede comunicarse con los agentes que puede sentir, pero uno podría imaginar las restricciones topológicas evolucionadas en la comunicación basada en una red de comunicaciones entre agentes donde los enlaces no siempre están activos. Comunicación En nuestro sistema, los agentes podrán comunicarse entre sí. Sin embargo, debido a las restricciones topológicas antes mencionadas, no podrán comunicarse con ningún agente en ningún momento. Con quién puede comunicarse un agente se definirá dinámicamente (por ejemplo, esto puede ser una consecuencia de que los agentes estén lo suficientemente cerca como para ponerse en contacto). Denotaremos abstractamente por C (AI, AJ, T) la propiedad de comunicación, en otras palabras, el hecho de que los agentes AI y AJ pueden comunicarse en el tiempo T (tenga en cuenta que se supone que esta relación es simétrica, pero por supuesto que no es transitiva). Ahora estamos en condiciones de definir dos propiedades esenciales de nuestro sistema. Definición 4 (ruta temporal). Existe una ruta de comunicación temporal en Horizon TF (notada LTF (AI, AJ)) entre AI y AJ si existe una secuencia de puntos de tiempo T1, T2 ,..., TN de TF y una secuencia de agentes K1, K2 ,..., KN S.T.(i) c (ai, ak1, t1), (ii) c (akn, aj, tn+1), (iii) ∀i ∈ [1, n], c (aki, aki+1, ti) intuitivamente,Lo que dice esta propiedad es que es posible encontrar una ruta temporal en el futuro que permita vincular a Agent AI y AJ a través de una secuencia de agentes intermediarios. Tenga en cuenta que los puntos de tiempo no son necesariamente sucesivos, y que la secuencia de agentes puede involucrar a los mismos agentes varias veces. Definición 5 (Connexidad temporal). Un sistema es temporal Connex Iff ∀t ∀ (i, j) ∈ [1, n] 2 lt (ai, aj) En resumen, un sistema de conexión temporal garantiza que cualquier agente podrá comunicarse con cualquier otro agente, sin importarCuánto tiempo podría tardar en hacerlo, en cualquier momento. Para decirlo de otra manera, nunca es el caso que un agente se aislará para siempre de otro agente del sistema. Luego discutiremos los detalles de cómo la comunicación tiene lugar concretamente en nuestro sistema. Recuerde que en este artículo, solo consideramos el caso de los intercambios bilaterales (un agente solo puede hablar con un solo otro agente), y que también suponemos que cualquier agente solo puede participar en un solo intercambio en una ronda determinada.3. Protocolos y estrategias En esta sección, discutimos los requisitos de los protocolos de interacción que rigen el intercambio de mensajes entre los agentes y proporcionamos una instanciación de ejemplo de dichos protocolos. Para aclarar la presentación, distinguimos dos niveles: el nivel local, que se refiere a la regulación de los intercambios bilaterales;y el nivel global, que esencialmente regula la forma en que los agentes pueden participar en una conversación. En cada nivel, separamos lo que especifica el protocolo y lo que queda a las estrategias de los agentes. Protocolo y estrategias locales, comenzamos inspeccionando protocolos y estrategias locales que regularán la comunicación entre los agentes del sistema. A medida que nos limitamos a la comunicación bilateral, estos protocolos simplemente involucrarán a dos agentes. Dicho protocolo tendrá que cumplir con un requisito básico para ser satisfactorio.• Consistencia (contras): un protocolo local debe garantizar la consistencia mutua de los agentes tras la terminación (lo que implica la terminación del curso). Figura 1: Un protocolo de intercambio de hipótesis [1] Un ejemplo, tal protocolo es el protocolo descrito en [1] que se muestra en la figura 1. Para ilustrar aún más cómo los agentes pueden utilizar dicho protocolo, damos algunos detalles sobre una posible estrategia: al recibir una hipótesis H1 (proponer (H1) o contrapropuesta (H1)) de A1, el agente A2 está en el estado 2 y tiene la siguientePosibles respuestas: Contratale (si el agente conoce un ejemplo que contradice la hipótesis, o no explicada por esta hipótesis), desafíe (si los agentes carecen de evidencia para aceptar esta hipótesis), contrapropuesta (si el agente está de acuerdo con la hipótesis pero prefiere otro), o aceptar (si es tan bueno como su hipótesis favorita). Esta estrategia garantiza, entre otras propiedades, la eventual consistencia lógica mutua de los agentes involucrados [1]. Protocolo global El protocolo global regula la forma en que se iniciarán los intercambios bilaterales entre los agentes. En cada turno, los agentes enviarán simultáneamente una solicitud ponderada para comunicarse a otros agentes. Este peso es un valor que mide los agentes voluntad de conversar con el agente objetivo (en la práctica, esto puede basarse en diferentes heurísticas, pero haremos algunas suposiciones sobre las estrategias de los agentes, ver más abajo). Enviar dicha solicitud es un tipo de compromiso condicional para el agente. Un agente que envía una solicitud ponderada se compromete a entablar una conversación con el objetivo si no recibe y se acepta otra solicitud. Una vez que se ha recibido toda la solicitud, cada agente responde con un accesorio o un rechazo. Al responder con una aceptación, un agente se compromete completo a entablar una conversación con el remitente. Por lo tanto, solo puede enviar una aceptación en una ronda dada, ya que un agente solo puede participar en una conversación por paso de tiempo. Cuando se ha recibido toda la respuesta, cada agente que recibe una aceptación puede iniciar una conversación utilizando el protocolo local o enviar una cancelación si ha aceptado otra solicitud. Al final de todos los intercambios bilaterales, los agentes que participan en la conversación se descartan del protocolo. Luego, cada uno de los agentes restantes se reúne una solicitud y el proceso itera hasta que no se envían más solicitudes. Estrategia global ahora definimos cuatro requisitos para las estrategias utilizadas por los agentes, dependiendo de su papel en el protocolo: dos están preocupados por el rol de solicitante (cómo decidir a quién es el 1000 el sexto intl. Conf.¿Sobre agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) el agente desea comunicarse?), los otros dos con el rol de respondedor (¿cómo decidir qué solicitud de comunicación aceptar o no?).• La voluntad de resolver inconsistiaciones (resolver): los agentes quieren comunicarse con cualquier otro agente a menos que sepan que son mutuamente consistentes.• Concéntrese en resolver inconsistencias (enfoque): los agentes no solicitan comunicación con un agente con el que saben que son mutuamente consistentes.• La voluntad de comunicar (Comm) -gents no puede rechazar una solicitud de comunicación ponderada, a menos que acaban de recibir o enviar una solicitud con un peso mayor.• Los agentes de solicitud de compromiso con la solicitud de comunicación (REQU) no pueden aceptar una solicitud de comunicación ponderada si han enviado una solicitud de comunicación con un mayor peso. Por lo tanto, no cancelarán su solicitud a menos que hayan recibido una solicitud de comunicación con mayor peso. Ahora, la estructura del protocolo, junto con las propiedades Comm+Requ, asegura que una solicitud solo pueda ser rechazada si su agente objetivo se involucra en comunicación con otro agente. Supongamos que el Agente AI quiere comunicarse con AJ enviando una solicitud con peso w.Comm garantiza que un agente que reciba una solicitud ponderada aceptará esta comunicación, aceptará una comunicación con un peso mayor o esperará la respuesta a una solicitud con un peso mayor. Esto asegura que la solicitud con un peso máximo sea aceptada y no cancelada (según lo requerirá que un agente que envíe una solicitud solo puede cancelarla si acepta otra solicitud con mayor peso). Por lo tanto, al menos dos agentes entablarán una conversación por ronda del protocolo global. Como el protocolo asegura que AI pueda reenviar su solicitud mientras que AJ no se dedica a una conversación, habrá un giro en el que AJ debe participar en una conversación, ya sea con AI u otro agente. Estos requisitos se refieren a la solicitud y la aceptación de la solicitud, pero los agentes también necesitan alguna estrategia de atribución de peso. Describimos a continuación una estrategia altruista, utilizada en nuestros experimentos. Al cooperar, un agente puede querer saber más de los deseos de comunicación de otros agentes para mejorar la asignación general de intercambios a los agentes. Luego se agrega un paso de solicitud de contexto al protocolo global. Antes de enviar su solicitud ponderada elegida, los agentes atribuyen un peso a todos los agentes con los que están preparados para comunicarse, de acuerdo con algunos factores internos. En el caso más simple, este peso será 1 para todos los agentes con el que el agente no está seguro de ser mutuamente consistente (garantizar la resolución), no se considera otro agente para la comunicación (garantizar el enfoque). Luego, el agente envía una solicitud de contexto a todos los agentes con los que se considera la comunicación. Esta solicitud también proporciona información sobre el remitente (lista de comunicaciones consideradas junto con su peso). Después de la recepción de todas las solicitudes de contexto, los agentes responderán con un Deny, si ya están involucrados en una conversación (en cuyo caso, el agente solicitante ya no considerará la comunicación con ellos a este momento), o una información informativa al solicitanteinformación sobre las solicitudes que ha enviado y recibido. Cuando se han recibido todas las respuestas, cada agente puede calcular el peso de todas las solicitudes sobre ella. Lo hace restando del peso de su solicitud el peso de todas las solicitudes sobre él o su objetivo (es decir, el peso final de la solicitud de AI a AJ es Wi, J = Wi, J +Wj, I - ((P k∈R (i) - {j} wi, k + p k∈S (i) - {j} wk, i + p k∈R (j) - {i} wj, k + p k∈S (j) - {i} wk, j) donde wi, j es el peso de la solicitud de ai a AJ, r (i) es el conjunto de índices de agentes que recibieron una solicitud de AI y S (i) es el conjuntode índice de agentes que han enviado una solicitud a AI). Luego finalmente envía una solicitud ponderada a los agentes que maximizan este peso (o esperan una solicitud) como se describe en el protocolo global.4. Convergencia (condicional) a la consistencia global en esta sección Mostraremos que los requisitos con respecto a los protocolos y estrategias que recién discutido serán suficientes para garantizar que el sistema eventualmente convergerá hacia la consistencia global, en algunas condiciones. Primero mostramos que, si dos agentes no son mutuamente consistentes en algún momento, entonces habrá necesariamente un momento en el futuro de tal manera que un agente aprenda una nueva observación, ya que es nueva para el sistema o al aprenderlo.de otro agente. Lema 1. Sea s un sistema poblado por los agentes n A1, A2, ..., An, temporal Connex e involucrando percepciones limitadas para estos agentes. Sea N1 la suma de las cardinalidades de la intersección de los conjuntos de observación por pares.(n1 = p (i, j) ∈ [1, n] 2 | oi ∩ oj |) Sea n2 la cardinalidad de la unión de los conjuntos de observaciones de todos los agentes.(n2 = | ∪n i = 1 oi |). Si ¬mcons (ai, aj) en el momento t0, necesariamente hay un tiempo t> t0 s.t.N1 o N2 aumentarán. Prueba. Supongamos que existe un tiempo T0 e índices (I, J) S.T.¬Mcons (ai, aj). Usaremos mt0 = p (k, l) ∈ [1, n] 2 εcomm (ak, al, t0) donde εcomm (ak, al, t0) = 1 si ak y al se han comunicado al menos una vez desde t0 y0 de lo contrario. Connexity temporal garantiza que existen T1, ..., TM+1 y K1, ..., KM S.T. C (AI, AK1, T1), C (AKM, AJ, TM+1) y ∀P ∈ [1, M], C (Akp, Akp+1, TP). Claramente, si McONS (AI, AK1), McONS (AKM, AJ) y ∀P, McONS (AKP, AKP+1), tenemos MCONS (AI, AJ) que contradice nuestra hipótesis (Mcons es transitivo, Mcons (AI,, AI,Ak1) ∧mcons (Ak1, Ak2) implica que McONS (AI, AK2) y así sucesivamente hasta McONS (AI, AKM) ∧ McONS (AKM, AJ) que implica McONS (AI, AJ)). Al menos dos agentes son necesariamente inconsistentes (¬mcons (AI, AK1), o ¬Mcons (AKM, AJ) o ∃P0 T.Q. ¬Mcons (Akp0, Akp0+1)). Deje que Ak y Al sean estos dos vecinos a la vez t> t0 1. La propiedad Resolver garantiza que AK o Al enviarán una solicitud de comunicación al otro agente en el momento t. Como se muestra anteriormente, esto a su vez asegura que al menos uno de estos agentes participará en una comunicación. Luego hay dos posibilidades: (Caso I) AK y Al se comunican en el momento t. En este caso, sabemos que ¬mcons (AK, AL). Esta y la propiedad de los contras asegura que al menos uno de los agentes debe cambiar su 1 estrictamente hablando, la transitividad de McONS solo garantiza que AK y Al sean inconsistentes en un momento t ≥ t0 que puede ser diferente del momento en que puedencomunicar. Pero si se vuelven consistentes entre T y T (o inconsistentes entre T y T), significa que al menos uno de ellos ha cambiado su hipótesis entre T y T, es decir, después de T0. Luego podemos aplicar el razonamiento del caso IIB. El sexto intl.

Luego tenemos nuevamente dos posibilidades: (Caso IIA) AK y AP no se comunicaron desde T0. Pero luego εcomm (AK, AP, T0) tuvo valor 0 y toma el valor 1. Por lo tanto, MT0 aumenta.(Caso IIB) AK y AP se comunicaron en algún momento T0> T0. La propiedad de contras del protocolo asegura que McONS (AK, AP) en ese momento. Ahora, el hecho de que se comuniquen y se centran implica que al menos uno de ellos cambió su hipótesis mientras tanto. El hecho de que los agentes sean autónomos a su vez que una nueva observación (percibida o recibida de otro agente) necesariamente provocó este cambio. El último caso aseguraría la existencia de un tiempo t> t0 y un agente aq s.t.O | OP ∩OQ |o | OK ∩OQ |aumentos de 1 en ese momento (implicando N1 (t)> N1 (T0)). El primer caso significa que el agente obtiene una nueva percepción o en el tiempo t. Si esa observación era desconocida en el sistema antes, entonces n2 (t)> n2 (t0). Si algún agente AQ ya conocía esta observación antes, entonces OP ∩ OQ o OK ∩ OQ aumenta de 1 en el tiempo t (lo que implica que N1 (t)> n1 (t0)). Por lo tanto, ¬mcons (Ai, AJ) en el momento t0 garantiza que, ya sea: −∃t> t0 t.q.n1 (t)> n1 (t0);o −∃t> t0 t.q.n2 (t)> n2 (t0);o −∃t> t0 t.q.MT0 aumenta de 1 en el tiempo t. Al iterando el razonamiento con t (pero manteniendo T0 como referencia de tiempo para MT0), podemos eliminar el tercer caso (MT0 es entero y está limitado por N2, lo que significa que después de un máximo de iteraciones N2, necesariamente estaremos en uno deotros dos casos.) Como resultado, hemos demostrado que si ¬mcons (ai, aj) en el momento t0, necesariamente hay un tiempo t s.t.N1 o N2 aumentarán. Teorema 1 (consistencia global). Sea s un sistema poblado por los agentes n A1, A2, ..., An, temporal Connex e involucrando percepciones limitadas para estos agentes. Deje que los contras (AI, AJ) sean una propiedad de consistencia transitiva. Luego, cualquier protocolo y estrategias que satisfagan las propiedades, resuelven, enfoque, comunicación y requisitos que el sistema convergerá hacia la consistencia global. Prueba. En aras de la contradicción, supongamos ∃i, j ∈ [1, n] s.t.∀t, ∃t0> t, T.Q.¬Cons (Ai, AJ, T0). Usando el lema, esto implica que ∃t> t0 s.t.O N1 (T)> N1 (T0) o N2 (T)> N2 (T0). Pero podemos aplicar el mismo razonamiento tomando t = t, lo que nos daría t1> t> t0 s.t.¬Cons (ai, aj, t1), que nos da t> t1 s.t.O N1 (T)> N1 (T1) o N2 (T)> N2 (T1). Por iteraciones sucesivas podemos construir una secuencia T0, T1, ..., TN, que se puede dividir en dos subsecientes T0, T1, ... Tn y T0, T1, ..., TN S.T.N1 (T0) <N1 (T1) <... <N1 (TN) y N2 (T0) <N2 (T1) <... <N2 (TN). Una de estas subsecuencias tiene que ser infinita. Sin embargo, N1 (Ti) y N2 (Ti) están creciendo estrictamente, enteros y limitados, lo que implica que ambos son finitos. Contradicción. Lo que muestra esencialmente el resultado anterior es que, en un sistema en el que ningún agente se aislará del resto de los agentes para siempre, solo supuestos muy leves en los protocolos y estrategias utilizadas por los agentes es suficiente para garantizar la convergencia hacia la consistencia del sistema en una cantidad finita.de tiempo (aunque puede llevar mucho tiempo). Desafortunadamente, en muchas situaciones críticas, no será posible asumir esta Connexidad temporal. Como los enfoques distribuidos como el que defiende en este documento se presentan con precisión como una buena manera de abordar los problemas de confiabilidad o problemas de dependencia para un centro que sea de suma importancia en estas aplicaciones críticas, es ciertamente interesante explorar más a fondo cómo talEl sistema se comportaría cuando relajamos esta suposición.5. Estudio experimental Este experimento involucra a los agentes que intentan escapar de un edificio en llamas. El entorno se describe como una cuadrícula espacial con un conjunto de paredes y (afortunadamente) algunas salidas. El tiempo y el espacio se consideran discretos. El tiempo se divide en rondas. Los agentes se localizan por su posición en la red espacial. Estos agentes pueden moverse y comunicarse con otros agentes. En una ronda, un agente puede moverse de una celda en cualquiera de las cuatro direcciones cardinales, siempre que no esté bloqueado por una pared. En esta aplicación, los agentes se comunican con cualquier otro agente (pero, recuerdan una sola) dado que este agente está a la vista, y que aún no han intercambiado su hipótesis favorita actual. De repente, un incendio estalla en estas instalaciones. De este momento, el fuego se propaga. Cada ronda, para cada casos donde hay fuego, el fuego se propaga en las cuatro direcciones. Sin embargo, el fuego no puede propagarse a través de una pared. Si el incendio se propaga en un caso en el que se coloca un agente, ese agente arde y se considera muerto. Por supuesto, ya no puede moverse ni comunicarse. Si un agente llega a una salida, se considera guardado y ya no se puede quemar. Los agentes conocen el entorno y las reglas que rigen la dinámica de este entorno, es decir, conocen el mapa, así como las reglas de propagación de incendios descritas anteriormente. También perciben localmente este entorno, pero no pueden ver más de 3 casos de distancia, en cualquier dirección. Las paredes también bloquean la línea de vista, evitando que los agentes vean detrás de ellas. A su vista, pueden ver a otros agentes y si los casos que ven están en llamas. Todas estas percepciones se memorizan. Ahora mostramos cómo esto instancia el marco abstracto que presenta el documento.• O = {Fire (x, y, t), nofire (x, y, t), agente (ai, x, y, t)} Las observaciones pueden ser positivas (o ∈ P (o) iff ∃h ∈ Hs.t. h | = o) o negativo (o ∈ N (o) iff ∃h ∈ H s.t. h | = ¬O).• H = {FireOrigin (X1, Y1, T1) ∧ ... ∧ Fireorigin (xl, yl, tl)} Las hipótesis son conjunciones de fireoriginas.• Contras (H, O) La relación de consistencia satisface: - Coherencia: ∀o ∈ N (O), H | = ¬O.- Completa: ∀o ∈ P (O), H | = o.- Minimalidad: para todas las h ∈ H, si H es coherente y completa para O, entonces H se prefiere a H de acuerdo con la relación de preferencia (H ≤p H) .2 2 selecciona primero el número mínimo de orígenes, entonces el más reciente ((Estrategia menos preventiva [6]), luego utiliza una clasificación fija arbitraria para discriminar a ex-auquo. La relación resultante es un orden total, por lo tanto, la minimalidad implica que habrá un solo H s.t.cons (o, h) para una O. Esto a su vez significa que McONS (AI, AJ) IFF Confes (AI), Contras (AJ) y HI = HJ. Esta relación es entonces transitiva y simétrica.1002 El sexto intl.

Efectividad de un protocolo La proporción de agentes que sobreviven al fuego sobre el número inicial de agentes involucrados en el experimento determinará la efectividad de un protocolo dado. Si este valor es alto, el protocolo ha sido efectivo para propagar la información y/o para que los agentes refinen sus hipótesis y determinen la mejor manera de salir. Eficiencia de un protocolo típicamente, el uso de información de apoyo implicará una sobrecarga de comunicación. Asumiremos aquí que la eficiencia de un protocolo dado se caracteriza por el flujo de datos inducido por este protocolo. En este artículo solo discutiremos este aspecto WRT.Protocolos locales. La medida principal que luego usaremos aquí es el tamaño total medio de los mensajes que se intercambian por agentes por intercambio (por lo tanto, teniendo en cuenta tanto el número de mensajes como el tamaño real de los mensajes, porque podría ser que los mensajes sonMuy grande, que contiene, por ejemplo, una gran cantidad de observaciones, que podrían contrarrestar un bajo número de mensajes).5.2 Configuración experimental Las configuraciones experimentales elegidas son las siguientes: • Topología ambiental: las actuaciones de propagación de información están altamente limitadas por la topología del medio ambiente. Las habilidades de percepción de los agentes dependen de la apertura del medio ambiente. Con una gran cantidad de paredes, las percepciones de los agentes son limitadas, y también el número de posibles comunicaciones entre agentes, mientras que un entorno abierto proporcionará posibilidades óptimas de percepción y propagación de información. Por lo tanto, proponemos un índice topológico (ver más abajo) como una base común para carterizar los entornos (MAP) utilizados durante las experimentos. El índice topológico (Ti) es la relación del número de células que pueden ser percibidas por agentes resumidos de todas las posiciones posibles, dividida por el número de células que se percibirían desde las mismas posiciones pero sin paredes.(Cuanto más cerca de 1, más abierto es el entorno). También utilizaremos dos medidas adicionales, más clásicas [10]: la longitud de la ruta característica 3 (CPL) y el coeficiente de agrupación4 (CC).• Número de agentes: la propagación de la información también depende del número inicial de agentes involucrados durante una experimentación. Por ejemplo, cuantos más agentes, más potenciales comunicaciones hay. Esto significa que habrá más potencial de propagación, pero también que la restricción de intercambio bilateral será más crucial.3 La CPL es la mediana de los medios de las longitudes de ruta más cortas que conectan cada nodo a todos los demás nodos.4 Caracterización del grado de aislamiento de una región de un entorno en términos de accesibilidad (número de carreteras que aún se utilizan para llegar a esta región).

Figura 2: Dos mapas (izquierda: Ti = 69%, Ti derecho = 38%) diseñamos tres mapas diferentes para cada índice (la Fig. 2 muestra dos de ellos), que contiene el mismo número máximo de agentes (36 agentes máx.)Con una densidad máxima de un agente por celda, el mismo número de salidas y un origen de fuego similar (por ejemplo, tiempo de inicio y posición). Los tres mapas diferentes de un índice dado están diseñados de la siguiente manera. El primer mapa es un modelo de un piso de construcción existente. El segundo mapa tiene el mismo recinto, salidas y origen de fuego que el primero, pero el número y la ubicación de las paredes son diferentes (las ubicaciones de las paredes están diseñadas por una heurística que crea paredes al azar en la red espacial de modo que no se creen habitaciones completamente cerradas.y que no se cierra la salida). El tercer mapa se caracteriza por el recinto geométrico en la ubicación de las paredes de las paredes, también está diseñada con la heurística antes mencionada. La Tabla 1 resume las diferentes medidas topológicas que caracterizan estos diferentes mapas. Vale la pena señalar que los valores confirman la relevancia de Ti (los mapas con un TI alto tienen un CPL bajo y un CC alto. Sin embargo, el CPL y CC permiten refinar aún más la diferencia entre los mapas, p.entre 53-1 y 53-2).5.4 Resultados experimentales para cada triple de mapas definidos como anteriormente realizamos los mismos experimentos. En cada experimento, la sociedad difiere en términos de su proporción inicial de agentes involucrados, del 1% al 100%. Esta proporción inicial representa el porcentaje de agentes involucrados con respecto al posible número máximo de agentes. Para cada mapa y cada proporción inicial, el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de agentes múltiples (AAMAS 07) 1003 seleccionamos al azar 100 ubicaciones de agentes iniciales diferentes. Para cada una de esas diferentes ubicaciones ejecutamos el sistema una vez para cada protocolo de interacción diferente. Efectividad de la comunicación y la argumentación El primer experimento que establecimos tiene como objetivo probar cuán efectivo es el intercambio de hipótesis (HE), y en particular cómo los aspectos topológicos afectarán esta efectividad. Para hacerlo, hemos calculado la relación de mejora ofrecida por ese protocolo sobre una situación en la que los agentes simplemente no podían comunicarse (sin comunicaciones). Para obtener más información sobre en qué medida el intercambio de hipótesis era realmente crucial, también probamos un protocolo mucho menos elaborado que consiste en simples intercambios de observación (OE). Más precisamente, este protocolo requiere que cada agente almacene cualquier observación inesperada que perciba, y los agentes simplemente intercambian sus respectivas listas de observaciones cuando discuten. En este caso, el protocolo local es diferente (tenga en cuenta que no garantiza la consistencia mutua), pero el protocolo global sigue siendo el mismo (a la única excepción que la motivación de los agentes para comunicarse es sincronizar su lista de observaciones, no su hipótesis.). Si este protocolo es, en el mejor de los casos, tan efectivo como él, tiene la ventaja de ser más eficiente (esto es obvio WRT la cantidad de mensajes que se limitarán a 2, menos sencillos en lo que respecta al tamaño de los mensajes, pero el rudoLa observación de que el intercambio de observaciones puede verse como una versión plana del desafío es útil para ver esto). Los resultados de estos experimentos se informan en la figura 3. Figura 3: Ganancia de la relación de efectividad comparativa de los protocolos cuando la proporción de agentes aumenta la primera observación que debe hacerse es que la comunicación mejora la efectividad del proceso, y esta relación aumenta a medida que el número de agentes crece en el sistema. La segunda lección que aprendemos aquí es que la cercanía hace que la comunicación sea más efectiva sobre la no comunicación. Mapas que exhiben un T.I.del 38% están constantemente por encima de los otros dos, y el 53% sigue siendo ligeramente pero significativamente mejor que el 69%. Sin embargo, estas curvas también sugieren, quizás sorprendentemente, que supera precisamente a las situaciones en las que la ganancia de la relación es menos importante (la única diferencia notable ocurre para mapas bastante abiertos donde T.I. es del 69%). Esto puede explicarse de la siguiente manera: cuando un mapa está abierto, los agentes tienen muchos candidatos de explicación potenciales, y la argumentación se vuelve útil para discriminar entre ellos. Cuando un mapa es como laberinto, hay menos explicaciones posibles para un evento inesperado. Importancia del protocolo global El segundo conjunto de experimentos busca evaluar la importancia del diseño del protocolo global. Probamos nuestro protocolo contra un protocolo de transmisión local (LB). La transmisión local significa que todos los agentes vecinos percibidos por un agente estarán involucrados en una comunicación con ese agente en una ronda dada, aliviamos la restricción de una sola comunicación por parte del agente. Esto nos da un límite superior rugoso sobre la posible ganancia de relación en el sistema (para un protocolo local dado). Nuevamente, evaluamos la ganancia de relación inducida por esa LB sobre nuestro HE clásico, para las tres clases diferentes de mapas. Los resultados se informan en la figura 4. Figura 4: ganancia de relación de transmisión local sobre hipótesis de intercambio de notas para comenzar con que la ganancia de relación es 0 cuando la proporción de agentes es del 5%, lo que se explica fácilmente por el hecho de que corresponde a situaciones que involucran solo dos agentes. Primero observamos que todas las clases de mapas son testigos de una ganancia de la relación aumentando cuando aumenta la proporción de agentes: la ganancia alcanza del 10 al 20%, dependiendo de la clase de mapas considerados. Si uno compara esto con la mejora informada en el experimento anterior, parece ser de la misma magnitud. Esto ilustra que el diseño del protocolo global no se puede ignorar, especialmente cuando la proporción de agentes es alta. Sin embargo, también notamos que las curvas de ganancia de la relación de efectividad tienen formas muy diferentes en ambos casos: la ganancia inducida por la precisión del protocolo local aumenta muy rápidamente con la proporción de agentes, mientras que la curva es realmente suave para la global. Ahora observemos más cuidadosamente los resultados informados aquí: la curva correspondiente a un TI del 53% está por encima de la correspondiente al 38%. Esto es así porque cuanto más abierto es un mapa, más oportunidades para comunicarse con más de un agente (y, por lo tanto, los beneficios de la transmisión). Sin embargo, también observamos que la curva para el 69% está por debajo del 53%. Esto se explica de la siguiente manera: en el caso del 69%, la ganancia potencial a obtener en términos de agentes sobrevivientes es mucho menor, porque nuestros protocolos ya dan resultados bastante eficientes de todos modos (alcanzando rápidamente el 90%, ver Fig. 3). Una regla general simple podría ser que cuando el número de agentes es pequeño, se debe poner atención especial en el 1004 local el sexto intl. Conf.En los agentes autónomos y el protocolo de sistemas múltiples (AAMAS 07), mientras que cuando ese número es grande, uno debe diseñar cuidadosamente el global (a menos que el mapa esté tan abierto que el protocolo ya es casi óptimo eficiente). Eficiencia de los protocolos El experimento final informado aquí se refiere al análisis de la eficiencia de los protocolos. Análisis aquí el tamaño medio de la totalidad de los mensajes que se intercambian por agentes (tamaño medio de intercambios, para corto) utilizando los siguientes protocolos: He, OE y dos protocolos variantes. El primero es un protocolo de intercambio de hipótesis restringido intermediario (RHE). RHE es el siguiente: no implica ningún desafío ni contraposte, lo que significa que los agentes no pueden cambiar su papel durante el protocolo (esto difiere de RE en ese sentido). En resumen, RHE permite que un agente agite las críticas de sus socios, y eventualmente este socio vendrá a adoptar la hipótesis de los agentes. Tenga en cuenta que esto significa que la autonomía del agente no se conserva aquí (ya que un agente esencialmente aceptará cualquier hipótesis que no pueda socavar), con la esperanza de que la ganancia en la eficiencia sea lo suficientemente significativa como para compensar una pérdida en efectividad. El segundo protocolo de variante es un protocolo completo de intercambio de observación (COE). COE utiliza los mismos principios que OE, pero incluye además todos los ejemplos negativos críticos (nofire) en el intercambio (por lo tanto, dan todos los ejemplos utilizados como argumentos del protocolo de intercambios de hipótesis), mejorando la efectividad. Los resultados para el MAP 69-1 se muestran en la Fig. 5. Figura 5: Tamaño medio de los intercambios Primero podemos observar el hecho de que el orden de los protocolos, de lo menos eficiente a los más eficientes, es Coe, He, Rhe y luego OE. Ser más eficiente que el COE demuestra que el proceso de argumentación gana eficiencia al seleccionar cuándo es necesario proporcionar un ejemplo negativo, que tiene menos impacto que positivos en nuestra prueba de prueba específica. Sin embargo, al comunicar hipótesis antes de dar la observación para apoyarlo (HE) en lugar de dar directamente las observaciones más cruciales (OE), el proceso de argumentación duplica el tamaño de los intercambios de datos. Es el costo de garantizar la consistencia al final del intercambio (una propiedad que OE no admite). También es significativo el hecho de que el tamaño medio de los intercambios es ligeramente mayor cuando el número de agentes es pequeño. Esto se explica por el hecho de que en estos casos solo unos pocos agentes tienen información relevante en su poder, y que deberán comunicarse mucho para obtener una visión común de la situación. Cuando aumenta el número de agentes, este conocimiento se distribuye sobre más agentes que necesitan discusiones más cortas para llegar a la consistencia mutua. Como consecuencia, la ganancia relativa en la eficiencia del uso de RHE parece ser mejor cuando el número de agentes es pequeño: cuando sea alto, difícilmente argumentarán de todos modos. Finalmente, vale la pena notar que la desviación estándar para estos experimentos es bastante alta, lo que significa que la conversación no converge a ningún patrón estereotípico.6. Conclusión Este documento ha investigado las propiedades de un sistema multiagente donde cada agente (distribuido) percibe localmente su entorno e intenta alcanzar la consistencia con otros agentes a pesar de las severas restricciones de comunicación. En particular, hemos exhibido condiciones que permiten la convergencia, e investigamos experimentalmente una situación típica en la que esas condiciones no pueden mantenerse. Hay muchas extensiones posibles en este trabajo, la primera es investigar más a fondo las propiedades de diferentes protocolos globales que pertenecen a la clase que identificamos y su influencia en el resultado. En particular, hay muchas heurísticas, altamente dependientes del contexto del estudio, que podría producir intuitivamente resultados interesantes (en nuestro estudio, seleccionar al destinatario sobre la base de lo que se puede inferir de sus acciones observadas podría ser una heurística). Un candidato obvio para problemas a más largo plazo se refiere a la relajación de la suposición de la detección perfecta.7. Referencias [1] G. Bourgne, N. Maudet y S. Pinson.

        "Communication In our system, agents will be able to communicate with each other.",
        "However, due to the aforementionned topological constraints, they will not be able to communicate with any agents at anytime.",
        "Who an agent can communicate with will be defined dynamically (for instance, this can be a consequence of the agents being close enough to get in touch).",
        "We will abstractly denote by C(ai, aj, t) the communication property, in other words, the fact that agents ai and aj can communicate at time t (note that this relation is assumed to be symetric, but of course not transitive).",
        "We are now in a position to define two essential properties of our system.",
        "Definition 4 (Temporal Path).",
        "There exists a temporal communication path at horizon tf (noted Ltf (aI , aJ )) between ai and aj iff there exists a sequence of time points t1, t2, . . . , tn from tf and a sequence of agents k1, k2, . . . , kn s.t. (i) C(aI , ak1 , t1), (ii) C(akn , aJ , tn+1), (iii) ∀i ∈ [1, n], C(aki , aki+1 , ti) Intuitively, what this property says is that it is possible to find a temporal path in the future that would allow to link agent ai and aj via a sequence of intermediary agents.",

        "To put it another way, it is never the case that an agent will be isolated for ever from another agent of the system.",
        "We will next discuss the detail of how communication concretely takes place in our system.",
        "Remember that in this paper, we only consider the case of bilateral exchanges (an agent can only speak to a single other agent), and that we also assume that any agent can only engage in a single exchange in a given round. 3.",
        "PROTOCOLS AND STRATEGIES In this section, we discuss the requirements of the interaction protocols that govern the exchange of messages between agents, and provide some example instantiation of such protocols.",
        "To clarify the presentation, we distinguish two levels: the local level, which is concerned with the regulation of bilateral exchanges; and the global level,which essentially regulates the way agents can actually engage into a conversation.",
        "At each level, we separate what is specified by the protocol, and what is left to agents strategies.",
        "Local Protocol and Strategies We start by inspecting local protocols and strategies that will regulate the communication between the agents of the system.",
        "As we limit ourselves to bilateral communication, these protocols will simply involve two agents.",
        "Such protocol will have to meet one basic requirement to be satisfying. • consistency (CONS)- a local protocol has to guarantee the mutual consistency of agents upon termination (which implies termination of course).",
        "Figure 1: A Hypotheses Exchange Protocol [1] One example such protocol is the protocol described in [1] that is pictured in Fig. 1.",
        "To further illustrate how such protocol can be used by agents, we give some details on a possible strategy: upon receiving a hypothesis h1 (propose(h1) or counterpropose(h1)) from a1, agent a2 is in state 2 and has the following possible replies: counterexample (if the agent knows an example contradicting the hypothesis, or not explained by this hypothesis), challenge (if the agents lacks evidence to accept this hypothesis), counterpropose (if the agent agrees with the hypothesis but prefers another one), or accept (if it is indeed as good as its favourite hypothesis).",
        "This strategy guarantees, among other properties, the eventual mutual logical consistency of the involved agents [1].",
        "Global Protocol The global protocol regulates the way bilateral exchanges will be initiated between agents.",
        "At each turn, agents will concurrently send one weighted request to communicate to other agents.",
        "This weight is a value measuring the agents willingness to converse with the targeted agent (in practice, this can be based on different heuristics, but we shall make some assumptions on agents strategies, see below).",
        "Sending such a request is a kind of conditional commitment for the agent.",
        "An agent sending a weighted request commits to engage in conversation with the target if he does not receive and accept himself another request.",
        "Once all request have been received, each agent replies with either an acccept or a reject.",
        "By answering with an accept, an agent makes a full commitment to engage in conversation with the sender.",
        "Therefore, it can only send one accept in a given round, as an agent can only participate in one conversation per time step.",
        "When all response have been received, each agent receiving an accept can either initiate a conversation using the local protocol or send a cancel if it has accepted another request.",
        "At the end of all the bilateral exchanges, the agents engaged in conversation are discarded from the protocol.",
        "Then each of the remaining agents resends a request and the process iterates until no more requests are sent.",
        "Global Strategy We now define four requirements for the strategies used by agents, depending on their role in the protocol: two are concerned with the requestee role (how to decide who the 1000 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) agent wishes to communicate with? ), the other two with the responder role (how to decide which communication request to accept or not?). • Willingness to solve inconsistancies (SOLVE)-agents want to communicate with any other agents unless they know they are mutually consistent. • Focus on solving inconsistencies (FOCUS)-agents do not request communication with an agent with whom they know they are mutually consistent. • Willingness to communicate (COMM)-agents cannot refuse a weighted communication request, unless they have just received or send a request with a greater weight. • Commitment to communication request (REQU)agents cannot accept a weighted communication request if they have themselves sent a communication request with a greater weight.",
        "Therefore, they will not cancel their request unless they have received a communicational request with greater weight.",
        "Now the protocol structure, together with the properties COMM+REQU, ensure that a request can only be rejected if its target agent engages in communication with another agent.",
        "Suppose indeed that agent ai wants to communicate with aj by sending a request with weight w. COMM guarantees that an agent receiving a weighted request will either accept this communication, accept a communication with a greater weight or wait for the answer to a request with a greater weight.",
        "This ensures that the request with maximal weight will be accepted and not cancelled (as REQU ensures that an agent sending a request can only cancel it if he accepts another request with greater weight).",
        "Therefore at least two agents will engage in conversation per round of the global protocol.",
        "As the protocol ensures that ai can resend its request while aj is not engaged in a conversation, there will be a turn in which aj must engage in a conversation, either with ai or another agent.",
        "These requirements concern request sending and acceptation, but agents also need some strategy of weight attribution.",
        "We describe below an altruist strategy, used in our experiments.",
        "Being cooperative, an agent may want to know more of the communication wishes of other agents in order to improve the overall allocation of exchanges to agents.",
        "A context request step is then added to the global protocol.",
        "Before sending their chosen weighted request, agents attribute a weight to all agents they are prepared to communicate with, according to some internal factors.",
        "In the simplest case, this weight will be 1 for all agent with whom the agent is not sure of being mutually consistent (ensuring SOLVE), other agent being not considered for communication (ensuring FOCUS).",
        "The agent then sends a context request to all agents with whom communication is considered.",
        "This request also provides information about the sender (list of considered communications along with their weight).",
        "After reception of all the context requests, agents will either reply with a deny, iff they are already engaged in a conversation (in which case, the requesting agent will not consider communication with them anymore in this turn), or an inform giving the requester information about the requests it has sent and received.",
        "When all replies have been received, each agent can calculate the weight of all requests concerning it.",
        "It does so by substracting from the weight of its request the weight of all requests concerning either it or its target (that is, the final weight of the request from ai to aj is Wi,j = wi,j +wj,i − ( P k∈R(i)−{j} wi,k + P k∈S(i)−{j} wk,i + P k∈R(j)−{i} wj,k + P k∈S(j)−{i} wk,j) where wi,j is the weight of the request of ai to aj, R(i) is the set of indice of agents having received a request from ai and S(i) is the set of indice of agents having send a request to ai).",
        "It then finally sends a weighted request to the agents who maximise this weight (or wait for a request) as described in the global protocol. 4. (CONDITIONAL) CONVERGENCE TO GLOBAL CONSISTENCY In this section we will show that the requirements regarding protocols and strategies just discussed will be sufficient to ensure that the system will eventually converge towards global consistency, under some conditions.",
        "We first show that, if two agents are not mutually consistent at some time, then there will be necessarily a time in the future such that an agent will learn a new observation, being it because it is new for the system, or by learning it from another agent.",

        "If this protocol is at best as effective as HE, it has the advantage of being more efficient (this is obvious wrt the number of messages which will be limited to 2, less straightforward as far as the size of messages is concerned, but the rough observation that the exchange of observations can be viewed as a flat version of the challenge is helpful to see this).",
        "The results of these experiments are reported in Fig. 3.",
        "Figure 3: Comparative effectiveness ratio gain of protocols when the proportion of agents augments The first observation that needs to be made is that communication improves the effectiveness of the process, and this ratio increases as the number of agents grows in the system.",
        "The second lesson that we learn here is that closeness relatively makes communication more effective over non communication.",
        "Maps exhibiting a T.I. of 38% are constantly above the two others, and 53% are still slightly but significantly better than 69%.",
        "However, these curves also suggest, perhaps surprisingly, that HE outperforms OE in precisely those situations where the ratio gain is less important (the only noticeable difference occurs for rather open maps where T.I. is 69%).",
        "This may be explained as follows: when a map is open, agents have many potential explanation candidates, and argumentation becomes useful to discriminate between those.",
        "When a map is labyrinth-like, there are fewer possible explanations to an unexpected event.",
        "Importance of the Global Protocol The second set of experiments seeks to evaluate the importance of the design of the global protocol.",
        "We tested our protocol against a local broadcast (LB) protocol.",
        "Local broadcast means that all the neighbours agents perceived by an agent will be involved in a communication with that agent in a given round -we alleviate the constraint of a single communication by agent.",
        "This gives us a rough upper bound upon the possible ratio gain in the system (for a given local protocol).",
        "Again, we evaluated the ratio gain induced by that LB over our classical HE, for the three different classes of maps.",
        "The results are reported in Fig. 4.",
        "Figure 4: Ratio gain of local broadcast over hypotheses exchange Note to begin with that the ratio gain is 0 when the proportion of agents is 5%, which is easily explained by the fact that it corresponds to situations involving only two agents.",
        "We first observe that all classes of maps witness a ratio gain increasing when the proportion of agents augments: the gain reaches 10 to 20%, depending on the class of maps considered.",
        "If one compares this with the improvement reported in the previous experiment, it appears to be of the same magnitude.",
        "This illustrates that the design of the global protocol cannot be ignored, especially when the proportion of agents is high.",
        "However, we also note that the effectiveness ratio gain curves have very different shapes in both cases: the gain induced by the accuracy of the local protocol increases very quickly with the proportion of agents, while the curve is really smooth for the global one.",
        "Now let us observe more carefully the results reported here: the curve corresponding to a TI of 53% is above that corresponding to 38%.",
        "This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast).",
        "However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%.",
        "This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).",
        "A simple rule of thumb could be that when the number of agents is small, special attention should be put on the local 1004 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) protocol, whereas when that number is large, one should carefully design the global one (unless the map is so open that the protocol is already almost optimally efficient).",
        "Efficiency of the Protocols The final experiment reported here is concerned with the analysis of the efficiency of the protocols.",
        "We analysis here the mean size of the totality of the messages that are exchanged by agents (mean size of exchanges, for short) using the following protocols: HE, OE, and two variant protocols.",
        "The first one is an intermediary restricted hypotheses exchange protocol (RHE).",
        "RHE is as follows: it does not involve any challenge nor counter-propose, which means that agents cannot switch their role during the protocol (this differs from RE in that respect).",
        "In short, RHE allows an agent to exhaust its partners criticism, and eventually this partner will come to adopt the agents hypothesis.",
        "Note that this means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here (as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness.",
        "The second variant protocol is a complete observation exchange protocol (COE).",
        "COE uses the same principles as OE, but includes in addition all critical negative examples (nofire) in the exchange (thus giving all examples used as arguments by the hypotheses exchanges protocol), hence improving effectiveness.",
        "Results for map 69-1 are shown on Fig. 5.",
        "Figure 5: Mean size of exchanges First we can observe the fact that the ordering of the protocols, from the least efficient to the most efficient, is COE, HE, RHE and then OE.",
        "HE being more efficient than COE proves that the argumentation process gains efficiency by selecting when it is needed to provide negative example, which have less impact that positive ones in our specific testbed.",
        "However, by communicating hypotheses before eventually giving observation to support it (HE) instead of directly giving the most crucial observations (OE), the argumentation process doubles the size of data exchanges.",
        "It is the cost for ensuring consistency at the end of the exchange (a property that OE does not support).",
        "Also significant is the fact the the mean size of exchanges is slightly higher when the number of agents is small.",
        "This is explained by the fact that in these cases only a very few agents have relevant informations in their possession, and that they will need to communicate a lot in order to come up with a common view of the situation.",
        "When the number of agents increases, this knowledge is distributed over more agents which need shorter discussions to get to mutual consistency.",
        "As a consequence, the relative gain in efficiency of using RHE appears to be better when the number of agents is small: when it is high, they will hardly argue anyway.",
        "Finally, it is worth noticing that the standard deviation for these experiments is rather high, which means that the conversation do not converge to any stereotypic pattern. 6.",
        "CONCLUSION This paper has investigated the properties of a multiagent system where each (distributed) agent locally perceives its environment, and tries to reach consistency with other agents despite severe communication restrictions.",
        "In particular we have exhibited conditions allowing convergence, and experimentally investigated a typical situation where those conditions cannot hold.",
        "There are many possible extensions to this work, the first being to further investigate the properties of different global protocols belonging to the class we identified, and their influence on the outcome.",
        "There are in particular many heuristics, highly dependent on the context of the study, that could intuitively yield interesting results (in our study, selecting the recipient on the basis of what can be inferred from his observed actions could be such a heuristic).",

                "This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast).",
                "However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%.",
                "This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).",

                "RHE is as follows: it does not involve any challenge nor counter-propose, which means that agents cannot switch their role during the protocol (this differs from RE in that respect).",
                "In short, RHE allows an agent to exhaust its partners criticism, and eventually this partner will come to adopt the agents hypothesis.",
                "Note that this means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here (as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness.",
                "The second variant protocol is a complete observation exchange protocol (COE).",
                "COE uses the same principles as OE, but includes in addition all critical negative examples (nofire) in the exchange (thus giving all examples used as arguments by the hypotheses exchanges protocol), hence improving effectiveness.",
                "Results for map 69-1 are shown on Fig. 5.",
                "Figure 5: Mean size of exchanges First we can observe the fact that the ordering of the protocols, from the least efficient to the most efficient, is COE, HE, RHE and then OE.",
                "HE being more efficient than COE proves that the argumentation process gains efficiency by selecting when it is needed to provide negative example, which have less impact that positive ones in our specific testbed.",
                "However, by communicating hypotheses before eventually giving observation to support it (HE) instead of directly giving the most crucial observations (OE), the argumentation process doubles the size of data exchanges.",
                "It is the cost for ensuring consistency at the end of the exchange (a property that OE does not support).",
                "Also significant is the fact the the mean size of exchanges is slightly higher when the number of agents is small.",
                "This is explained by the fact that in these cases only a very few agents have relevant informations in their possession, and that they will need to communicate a lot in order to come up with a common view of the situation.",
                "When the number of agents increases, this knowledge is distributed over more agents which need shorter discussions to get to mutual consistency.",
                "As a consequence, the relative gain in efficiency of using RHE appears to be better when the number of agents is small: when it is high, they will hardly argue anyway.",

                "This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast).",
                "However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%.",
                "This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).",

                "RHE is as follows: it does not involve any challenge nor counter-propose, which means that agents cannot switch their role during the protocol (this differs from RE in that respect).",
                "In short, RHE allows an agent to exhaust its partners criticism, and eventually this partner will come to adopt the agents hypothesis.",
                "Note that this means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here (as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness.",
                "The second variant protocol is a complete observation exchange protocol (COE).",
                "COE uses the same principles as OE, but includes in addition all critical negative examples (nofire) in the exchange (thus giving all examples used as arguments by the hypotheses exchanges protocol), hence improving effectiveness.",

                "Figure 5: Mean size of exchanges First we can observe the fact that the ordering of the protocols, from the least efficient to the most efficient, is COE, HE, RHE and then OE.",
                "HE being more efficient than COE proves that the argumentation process gains efficiency by selecting when it is needed to provide negative example, which have less impact that positive ones in our specific testbed.",
                "However, by communicating hypotheses before eventually giving observation to support it (HE) instead of directly giving the most crucial observations (OE), the argumentation process doubles the size of data exchanges.",
                "It is the cost for ensuring consistency at the end of the exchange (a property that OE does not support).",
                "Also significant is the fact the the mean size of exchanges is slightly higher when the number of agents is small.",
                "This is explained by the fact that in these cases only a very few agents have relevant informations in their possession, and that they will need to communicate a lot in order to come up with a common view of the situation.",
                "When the number of agents increases, this knowledge is distributed over more agents which need shorter discussions to get to mutual consistency.",
                "As a consequence, the relative gain in efficiency of using RHE appears to be better when the number of agents is small: when it is high, they will hardly argue anyway.",

                "This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast).",
                "However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%.",
                "This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).",

                "RHE is as follows: it does not involve any challenge nor counter-propose, which means that agents cannot switch their role during the protocol (this differs from RE in that respect).",
                "In short, RHE allows an agent to exhaust its partners criticism, and eventually this partner will come to adopt the agents hypothesis.",
                "Note that this means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here (as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness.",
                "The second variant protocol is a complete observation exchange protocol (COE).",
                "COE uses the same principles as OE, but includes in addition all critical negative examples (nofire) in the exchange (thus giving all examples used as arguments by the hypotheses exchanges protocol), hence improving effectiveness.",

                "Figure 5: Mean size of exchanges First we can observe the fact that the ordering of the protocols, from the least efficient to the most efficient, is COE, HE, RHE and then OE.",
                "HE being more efficient than COE proves that the argumentation process gains efficiency by selecting when it is needed to provide negative example, which have less impact that positive ones in our specific testbed.",
                "However, by communicating hypotheses before eventually giving observation to support it (HE) instead of directly giving the most crucial observations (OE), the argumentation process doubles the size of data exchanges.",
                "It is the cost for ensuring consistency at the end of the exchange (a property that OE does not support).",
                "Also significant is the fact the the mean size of exchanges is slightly higher when the number of agents is small.",
                "This is explained by the fact that in these cases only a very few agents have relevant informations in their possession, and that they will need to communicate a lot in order to come up with a common view of the situation.",
                "When the number of agents increases, this knowledge is distributed over more agents which need shorter discussions to get to mutual consistency.",
                "As a consequence, the relative gain in efficiency of using RHE appears to be better when the number of agents is small: when it is high, they will hardly argue anyway.",

                "More precisely, this protocol requires that each agent stores any unexpected observation that it perceives, and agents simply exchange their respective lists of observations when they discuss.",
                "In this case, the local protocol is different (note in particular that it does not guarantee mutual consistency), but the global protocol remains the same (at the only exception that agents motivation to communicate is to synchronise their list of observations, not their hypothesis).",
                "If this protocol is at best as effective as HE, it has the advantage of being more efficient (this is obvious wrt the number of messages which will be limited to 2, less straightforward as far as the size of messages is concerned, but the rough observation that the exchange of observations can be viewed as a flat version of the challenge is helpful to see this).",

                "Figure 3: Comparative effectiveness ratio gain of protocols when the proportion of agents augments The first observation that needs to be made is that communication improves the effectiveness of the process, and this ratio increases as the number of agents grows in the system.",

                "If one compares this with the improvement reported in the previous experiment, it appears to be of the same magnitude.",
                "This illustrates that the design of the global protocol cannot be ignored, especially when the proportion of agents is high.",
                "However, we also note that the effectiveness ratio gain curves have very different shapes in both cases: the gain induced by the accuracy of the local protocol increases very quickly with the proportion of agents, while the curve is really smooth for the global one.",
                "Now let us observe more carefully the results reported here: the curve corresponding to a TI of 53% is above that corresponding to 38%.",
                "This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast).",
                "However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%.",
                "This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).",

                "Note that this means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here (as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness.",
                "The second variant protocol is a complete observation exchange protocol (COE).",
                "COE uses the same principles as OE, but includes in addition all critical negative examples (nofire) in the exchange (thus giving all examples used as arguments by the hypotheses exchanges protocol), hence improving effectiveness.",

                "Figure 5: Mean size of exchanges First we can observe the fact that the ordering of the protocols, from the least efficient to the most efficient, is COE, HE, RHE and then OE.",

                "Also significant is the fact the the mean size of exchanges is slightly higher when the number of agents is small.",
                "This is explained by the fact that in these cases only a very few agents have relevant informations in their possession, and that they will need to communicate a lot in order to come up with a common view of the situation.",
                "When the number of agents increases, this knowledge is distributed over more agents which need shorter discussions to get to mutual consistency.",
                "As a consequence, the relative gain in efficiency of using RHE appears to be better when the number of agents is small: when it is high, they will hardly argue anyway.",

                "More precisely, this protocol requires that each agent stores any unexpected observation that it perceives, and agents simply exchange their respective lists of observations when they discuss.",
                "In this case, the local protocol is different (note in particular that it does not guarantee mutual consistency), but the global protocol remains the same (at the only exception that agents motivation to communicate is to synchronise their list of observations, not their hypothesis).",
                "If this protocol is at best as effective as HE, it has the advantage of being more efficient (this is obvious wrt the number of messages which will be limited to 2, less straightforward as far as the size of messages is concerned, but the rough observation that the exchange of observations can be viewed as a flat version of the challenge is helpful to see this).",

                "If one compares this with the improvement reported in the previous experiment, it appears to be of the same magnitude.",
                "This illustrates that the design of the global protocol cannot be ignored, especially when the proportion of agents is high.",
                "However, we also note that the effectiveness ratio gain curves have very different shapes in both cases: the gain induced by the accuracy of the local protocol increases very quickly with the proportion of agents, while the curve is really smooth for the global one.",
                "Now let us observe more carefully the results reported here: the curve corresponding to a TI of 53% is above that corresponding to 38%.",
                "This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast).",
                "However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%.",
                "This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).",

                "Note that this means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here (as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness.",
                "The second variant protocol is a complete observation exchange protocol (COE).",
                "COE uses the same principles as OE, but includes in addition all critical negative examples (nofire) in the exchange (thus giving all examples used as arguments by the hypotheses exchanges protocol), hence improving effectiveness.",

                "Figure 5: Mean size of exchanges First we can observe the fact that the ordering of the protocols, from the least efficient to the most efficient, is COE, HE, RHE and then OE.",

                "However, by communicating hypotheses before eventually giving observation to support it (HE) instead of directly giving the most crucial observations (OE), the argumentation process doubles the size of data exchanges.",
                "It is the cost for ensuring consistency at the end of the exchange (a property that OE does not support).",
                "Also significant is the fact the the mean size of exchanges is slightly higher when the number of agents is small.",
                "This is explained by the fact that in these cases only a very few agents have relevant informations in their possession, and that they will need to communicate a lot in order to come up with a common view of the situation.",
                "When the number of agents increases, this knowledge is distributed over more agents which need shorter discussions to get to mutual consistency.",

                "In this case, the local protocol is different (note in particular that it does not guarantee mutual consistency), but the global protocol remains the same (at the only exception that agents motivation to communicate is to synchronise their list of observations, not their hypothesis).",

                "At each level, we separate what is specified by the protocol, and what is left to agents strategies.",
                "Local Protocol and Strategies We start by inspecting local protocols and strategies that will regulate the communication between the agents of the system.",
                "As we limit ourselves to bilateral communication, these protocols will simply involve two agents.",
                "Such protocol will have to meet one basic requirement to be satisfying. • consistency (CONS)- a local protocol has to guarantee the mutual consistency of agents upon termination (which implies termination of course).",
                "Figure 1: A Hypotheses Exchange Protocol [1] One example such protocol is the protocol described in [1] that is pictured in Fig. 1.",
                "To further illustrate how such protocol can be used by agents, we give some details on a possible strategy: upon receiving a hypothesis h1 (propose(h1) or counterpropose(h1)) from a1, agent a2 is in state 2 and has the following possible replies: counterexample (if the agent knows an example contradicting the hypothesis, or not explained by this hypothesis), challenge (if the agents lacks evidence to accept this hypothesis), counterpropose (if the agent agrees with the hypothesis but prefers another one), or accept (if it is indeed as good as its favourite hypothesis).",
                "This strategy guarantees, among other properties, the eventual mutual logical consistency of the involved agents [1].",
                "Global Protocol The global protocol regulates the way bilateral exchanges will be initiated between agents.",
                "At each turn, agents will concurrently send one weighted request to communicate to other agents.",
                "This weight is a value measuring the agents willingness to converse with the targeted agent (in practice, this can be based on different heuristics, but we shall make some assumptions on agents strategies, see below).",
                "Sending such a request is a kind of conditional commitment for the agent.",
                "An agent sending a weighted request commits to engage in conversation with the target if he does not receive and accept himself another request.",
                "Once all request have been received, each agent replies with either an acccept or a reject.",
                "By answering with an accept, an agent makes a full commitment to engage in conversation with the sender.",
                "Therefore, it can only send one accept in a given round, as an agent can only participate in one conversation per time step.",
                "When all response have been received, each agent receiving an accept can either initiate a conversation using the local protocol or send a cancel if it has accepted another request.",
                "At the end of all the bilateral exchanges, the agents engaged in conversation are discarded from the protocol.",
                "Then each of the remaining agents resends a request and the process iterates until no more requests are sent.",
                "Global Strategy We now define four requirements for the strategies used by agents, depending on their role in the protocol: two are concerned with the requestee role (how to decide who the 1000 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Therefore, they will not cancel their request unless they have received a communicational request with greater weight.",
                "Now the protocol structure, together with the properties COMM+REQU, ensure that a request can only be rejected if its target agent engages in communication with another agent.",
                "Suppose indeed that agent ai wants to communicate with aj by sending a request with weight w. COMM guarantees that an agent receiving a weighted request will either accept this communication, accept a communication with a greater weight or wait for the answer to a request with a greater weight.",
                "This ensures that the request with maximal weight will be accepted and not cancelled (as REQU ensures that an agent sending a request can only cancel it if he accepts another request with greater weight).",
                "Therefore at least two agents will engage in conversation per round of the global protocol.",
                "As the protocol ensures that ai can resend its request while aj is not engaged in a conversation, there will be a turn in which aj must engage in a conversation, either with ai or another agent.",
                "These requirements concern request sending and acceptation, but agents also need some strategy of weight attribution.",
                "We describe below an altruist strategy, used in our experiments.",
                "Being cooperative, an agent may want to know more of the communication wishes of other agents in order to improve the overall allocation of exchanges to agents.",
                "A context request step is then added to the global protocol.",
                "Before sending their chosen weighted request, agents attribute a weight to all agents they are prepared to communicate with, according to some internal factors.",
                "In the simplest case, this weight will be 1 for all agent with whom the agent is not sure of being mutually consistent (ensuring SOLVE), other agent being not considered for communication (ensuring FOCUS).",
                "The agent then sends a context request to all agents with whom communication is considered.",
                "This request also provides information about the sender (list of considered communications along with their weight).",
                "After reception of all the context requests, agents will either reply with a deny, iff they are already engaged in a conversation (in which case, the requesting agent will not consider communication with them anymore in this turn), or an inform giving the requester information about the requests it has sent and received.",
                "When all replies have been received, each agent can calculate the weight of all requests concerning it.",
                "It does so by substracting from the weight of its request the weight of all requests concerning either it or its target (that is, the final weight of the request from ai to aj is Wi,j = wi,j +wj,i − ( P k∈R(i)−{j} wi,k + P k∈S(i)−{j} wk,i + P k∈R(j)−{i} wj,k + P k∈S(j)−{i} wk,j) where wi,j is the weight of the request of ai to aj, R(i) is the set of indice of agents having received a request from ai and S(i) is the set of indice of agents having send a request to ai).",
                "It then finally sends a weighted request to the agents who maximise this weight (or wait for a request) as described in the global protocol. 4. (CONDITIONAL) CONVERGENCE TO GLOBAL CONSISTENCY In this section we will show that the requirements regarding protocols and strategies just discussed will be sufficient to ensure that the system will eventually converge towards global consistency, under some conditions.",

                "If this protocol is at best as effective as HE, it has the advantage of being more efficient (this is obvious wrt the number of messages which will be limited to 2, less straightforward as far as the size of messages is concerned, but the rough observation that the exchange of observations can be viewed as a flat version of the challenge is helpful to see this).",

                "Figure 3: Comparative effectiveness ratio gain of protocols when the proportion of agents augments The first observation that needs to be made is that communication improves the effectiveness of the process, and this ratio increases as the number of agents grows in the system.",

                "Maps exhibiting a T.I. of 38% are constantly above the two others, and 53% are still slightly but significantly better than 69%.",
                "However, these curves also suggest, perhaps surprisingly, that HE outperforms OE in precisely those situations where the ratio gain is less important (the only noticeable difference occurs for rather open maps where T.I. is 69%).",
                "This may be explained as follows: when a map is open, agents have many potential explanation candidates, and argumentation becomes useful to discriminate between those.",

                "This gives us a rough upper bound upon the possible ratio gain in the system (for a given local protocol).",
                "Again, we evaluated the ratio gain induced by that LB over our classical HE, for the three different classes of maps.",
                "The results are reported in Fig. 4.",
                "Figure 4: Ratio gain of local broadcast over hypotheses exchange Note to begin with that the ratio gain is 0 when the proportion of agents is 5%, which is easily explained by the fact that it corresponds to situations involving only two agents.",
                "We first observe that all classes of maps witness a ratio gain increasing when the proportion of agents augments: the gain reaches 10 to 20%, depending on the class of maps considered.",
                "If one compares this with the improvement reported in the previous experiment, it appears to be of the same magnitude.",
                "This illustrates that the design of the global protocol cannot be ignored, especially when the proportion of agents is high.",
                "However, we also note that the effectiveness ratio gain curves have very different shapes in both cases: the gain induced by the accuracy of the local protocol increases very quickly with the proportion of agents, while the curve is really smooth for the global one.",
                "Now let us observe more carefully the results reported here: the curve corresponding to a TI of 53% is above that corresponding to 38%.",
                "This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast).",
                "However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%.",
                "This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).",

                "In short, RHE allows an agent to exhaust its partners criticism, and eventually this partner will come to adopt the agents hypothesis.",
                "Note that this means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here (as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness.",
                "The second variant protocol is a complete observation exchange protocol (COE).",
                "COE uses the same principles as OE, but includes in addition all critical negative examples (nofire) in the exchange (thus giving all examples used as arguments by the hypotheses exchanges protocol), hence improving effectiveness.",

                "Figure 5: Mean size of exchanges First we can observe the fact that the ordering of the protocols, from the least efficient to the most efficient, is COE, HE, RHE and then OE.",
                "HE being more efficient than COE proves that the argumentation process gains efficiency by selecting when it is needed to provide negative example, which have less impact that positive ones in our specific testbed.",
                "However, by communicating hypotheses before eventually giving observation to support it (HE) instead of directly giving the most crucial observations (OE), the argumentation process doubles the size of data exchanges.",
                "It is the cost for ensuring consistency at the end of the exchange (a property that OE does not support).",
                "Also significant is the fact the the mean size of exchanges is slightly higher when the number of agents is small.",
                "This is explained by the fact that in these cases only a very few agents have relevant informations in their possession, and that they will need to communicate a lot in order to come up with a common view of the situation.",
                "When the number of agents increases, this knowledge is distributed over more agents which need shorter discussions to get to mutual consistency.",
                "As a consequence, the relative gain in efficiency of using RHE appears to be better when the number of agents is small: when it is high, they will hardly argue anyway.",

                "This may be explained as follows: when a map is open, agents have many potential explanation candidates, and argumentation becomes useful to discriminate between those.",

                "Figure 4: Ratio gain of local broadcast over hypotheses exchange Note to begin with that the ratio gain is 0 when the proportion of agents is 5%, which is easily explained by the fact that it corresponds to situations involving only two agents.",
                "We first observe that all classes of maps witness a ratio gain increasing when the proportion of agents augments: the gain reaches 10 to 20%, depending on the class of maps considered.",

                "However, we also note that the effectiveness ratio gain curves have very different shapes in both cases: the gain induced by the accuracy of the local protocol increases very quickly with the proportion of agents, while the curve is really smooth for the global one.",
                "Now let us observe more carefully the results reported here: the curve corresponding to a TI of 53% is above that corresponding to 38%.",
                "This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast).",
                "However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%.",
                "This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).",

                "Note that this means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here (as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness.",
                "The second variant protocol is a complete observation exchange protocol (COE).",
                "COE uses the same principles as OE, but includes in addition all critical negative examples (nofire) in the exchange (thus giving all examples used as arguments by the hypotheses exchanges protocol), hence improving effectiveness.",

                "However, by communicating hypotheses before eventually giving observation to support it (HE) instead of directly giving the most crucial observations (OE), the argumentation process doubles the size of data exchanges.",

                "This is explained by the fact that in these cases only a very few agents have relevant informations in their possession, and that they will need to communicate a lot in order to come up with a common view of the situation.",
                "When the number of agents increases, this knowledge is distributed over more agents which need shorter discussions to get to mutual consistency.",

                "Figure 4: Ratio gain of local broadcast over hypotheses exchange Note to begin with that the ratio gain is 0 when the proportion of agents is 5%, which is easily explained by the fact that it corresponds to situations involving only two agents.",
                "We first observe that all classes of maps witness a ratio gain increasing when the proportion of agents augments: the gain reaches 10 to 20%, depending on the class of maps considered.",
                "If one compares this with the improvement reported in the previous experiment, it appears to be of the same magnitude.",
                "This illustrates that the design of the global protocol cannot be ignored, especially when the proportion of agents is high.",
                "However, we also note that the effectiveness ratio gain curves have very different shapes in both cases: the gain induced by the accuracy of the local protocol increases very quickly with the proportion of agents, while the curve is really smooth for the global one.",
                "Now let us observe more carefully the results reported here: the curve corresponding to a TI of 53% is above that corresponding to 38%.",
                "This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast).",
                "However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%.",
                "This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).",

                "In short, RHE allows an agent to exhaust its partners criticism, and eventually this partner will come to adopt the agents hypothesis.",
                "Note that this means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here (as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness.",
                "The second variant protocol is a complete observation exchange protocol (COE).",
                "COE uses the same principles as OE, but includes in addition all critical negative examples (nofire) in the exchange (thus giving all examples used as arguments by the hypotheses exchanges protocol), hence improving effectiveness.",

                "Figure 5: Mean size of exchanges First we can observe the fact that the ordering of the protocols, from the least efficient to the most efficient, is COE, HE, RHE and then OE.",
                "HE being more efficient than COE proves that the argumentation process gains efficiency by selecting when it is needed to provide negative example, which have less impact that positive ones in our specific testbed.",
                "However, by communicating hypotheses before eventually giving observation to support it (HE) instead of directly giving the most crucial observations (OE), the argumentation process doubles the size of data exchanges.",
                "It is the cost for ensuring consistency at the end of the exchange (a property that OE does not support).",
                "Also significant is the fact the the mean size of exchanges is slightly higher when the number of agents is small.",
                "This is explained by the fact that in these cases only a very few agents have relevant informations in their possession, and that they will need to communicate a lot in order to come up with a common view of the situation.",
                "When the number of agents increases, this knowledge is distributed over more agents which need shorter discussions to get to mutual consistency.",

                "Figure 4: Ratio gain of local broadcast over hypotheses exchange Note to begin with that the ratio gain is 0 when the proportion of agents is 5%, which is easily explained by the fact that it corresponds to situations involving only two agents.",
                "We first observe that all classes of maps witness a ratio gain increasing when the proportion of agents augments: the gain reaches 10 to 20%, depending on the class of maps considered.",
                "If one compares this with the improvement reported in the previous experiment, it appears to be of the same magnitude.",
                "This illustrates that the design of the global protocol cannot be ignored, especially when the proportion of agents is high.",
                "However, we also note that the effectiveness ratio gain curves have very different shapes in both cases: the gain induced by the accuracy of the local protocol increases very quickly with the proportion of agents, while the curve is really smooth for the global one.",
                "Now let us observe more carefully the results reported here: the curve corresponding to a TI of 53% is above that corresponding to 38%.",
                "This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast).",
                "However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%.",
                "This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).",

                "We analysis here the mean size of the totality of the messages that are exchanged by agents (mean size of exchanges, for short) using the following protocols: HE, OE, and two variant protocols.",
                "The first one is an intermediary restricted hypotheses exchange protocol (RHE).",
                "RHE is as follows: it does not involve any challenge nor counter-propose, which means that agents cannot switch their role during the protocol (this differs from RE in that respect).",
                "In short, RHE allows an agent to exhaust its partners criticism, and eventually this partner will come to adopt the agents hypothesis.",
                "Note that this means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here (as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness.",
                "The second variant protocol is a complete observation exchange protocol (COE).",
                "COE uses the same principles as OE, but includes in addition all critical negative examples (nofire) in the exchange (thus giving all examples used as arguments by the hypotheses exchanges protocol), hence improving effectiveness.",
                "Results for map 69-1 are shown on Fig. 5.",
                "Figure 5: Mean size of exchanges First we can observe the fact that the ordering of the protocols, from the least efficient to the most efficient, is COE, HE, RHE and then OE.",
                "HE being more efficient than COE proves that the argumentation process gains efficiency by selecting when it is needed to provide negative example, which have less impact that positive ones in our specific testbed.",
                "However, by communicating hypotheses before eventually giving observation to support it (HE) instead of directly giving the most crucial observations (OE), the argumentation process doubles the size of data exchanges.",
                "It is the cost for ensuring consistency at the end of the exchange (a property that OE does not support).",
                "Also significant is the fact the the mean size of exchanges is slightly higher when the number of agents is small.",
                "This is explained by the fact that in these cases only a very few agents have relevant informations in their possession, and that they will need to communicate a lot in order to come up with a common view of the situation.",
                "When the number of agents increases, this knowledge is distributed over more agents which need shorter discussions to get to mutual consistency.",
                "As a consequence, the relative gain in efficiency of using RHE appears to be better when the number of agents is small: when it is high, they will hardly argue anyway.",

                "This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast).",
                "However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%.",
                "This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).",

                "RHE is as follows: it does not involve any challenge nor counter-propose, which means that agents cannot switch their role during the protocol (this differs from RE in that respect).",
                "In short, RHE allows an agent to exhaust its partners criticism, and eventually this partner will come to adopt the agents hypothesis.",
                "Note that this means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here (as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness.",
                "The second variant protocol is a complete observation exchange protocol (COE).",
                "COE uses the same principles as OE, but includes in addition all critical negative examples (nofire) in the exchange (thus giving all examples used as arguments by the hypotheses exchanges protocol), hence improving effectiveness.",

                "Figure 5: Mean size of exchanges First we can observe the fact that the ordering of the protocols, from the least efficient to the most efficient, is COE, HE, RHE and then OE.",
                "HE being more efficient than COE proves that the argumentation process gains efficiency by selecting when it is needed to provide negative example, which have less impact that positive ones in our specific testbed.",
                "However, by communicating hypotheses before eventually giving observation to support it (HE) instead of directly giving the most crucial observations (OE), the argumentation process doubles the size of data exchanges.",
                "It is the cost for ensuring consistency at the end of the exchange (a property that OE does not support).",
                "Also significant is the fact the the mean size of exchanges is slightly higher when the number of agents is small.",
                "This is explained by the fact that in these cases only a very few agents have relevant informations in their possession, and that they will need to communicate a lot in order to come up with a common view of the situation.",
                "When the number of agents increases, this knowledge is distributed over more agents which need shorter discussions to get to mutual consistency.",
                "As a consequence, the relative gain in efficiency of using RHE appears to be better when the number of agents is small: when it is high, they will hardly argue anyway.",

                "This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast).",
                "However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%.",
                "This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).",

                "RHE is as follows: it does not involve any challenge nor counter-propose, which means that agents cannot switch their role during the protocol (this differs from RE in that respect).",
                "In short, RHE allows an agent to exhaust its partners criticism, and eventually this partner will come to adopt the agents hypothesis.",
                "Note that this means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here (as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness.",
                "The second variant protocol is a complete observation exchange protocol (COE).",
                "COE uses the same principles as OE, but includes in addition all critical negative examples (nofire) in the exchange (thus giving all examples used as arguments by the hypotheses exchanges protocol), hence improving effectiveness.",

                "This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast).",
                "However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%.",
                "This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).",

                "Now let us observe more carefully the results reported here: the curve corresponding to a TI of 53% is above that corresponding to 38%.",
                "This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast).",
                "However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%.",
                "This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).",

                "Note that this means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here (as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness.",

                "Figure 3: Comparative effectiveness ratio gain of protocols when the proportion of agents augments The first observation that needs to be made is that communication improves the effectiveness of the process, and this ratio increases as the number of agents grows in the system.",

                "Now let us observe more carefully the results reported here: the curve corresponding to a TI of 53% is above that corresponding to 38%.",
                "This is so because the more open a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast).",
                "However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for 53%.",
                "This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is much lower, because our protocols already give rather efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).",

                "Note that this means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here (as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness.",
