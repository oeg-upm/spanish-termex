We show that we can significantly outperform PageRank using features that are independent of the link structure of the Web. We gain a further boost in accuracy by using data on the frequency at which users visit Web pages. We use RankNet, a ranking machine learning algorithm, to combine these and other static features based on anchor text and domain characteristics. The resulting model achieves a static ranking pairwise accuracy of 67.3% (vs. 56.7% for PageRank or 50% for random). Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.6 [Artificial Intelligence]: Learning.

INTRODUCTION Over the past decade, the Web has grown exponentially in size. Unfortunately, this growth has not been isolated to good-quality pages. The number of incorrect, spamming, and malicious (e.g., phishing) sites has also grown rapidly. The sheer number of both good and bad pages on the Web has led to an increasing reliance on search engines for the discovery of useful information. Users rely on search engines not only to return pages related to their search query, but also to separate the good from the bad, and order results so that the best pages are suggested first. To date, most work on Web page ranking has focused on improving the ordering of the results returned to the user (querydependent ranking, or dynamic ranking). However, having a good query-independent ranking (static ranking) is also crucially important for a search engine. A good static ranking algorithm provides numerous benefits: • Relevance: The static rank of a page provides a general indicator to the overall quality of the page. This is a useful input to the dynamic ranking algorithm. • Efficiency: Typically, the search engines index is ordered by static rank. By traversing the index from highquality to low-quality pages, the dynamic ranker may abort the search when it determines that no later page will have as high of a dynamic rank as those already found. The more accurate the static rank, the better this early-stopping ability, and hence the quicker the search engine may respond to queries. • Crawl Priority: The Web grows and changes as quickly as search engines can crawl it. Search engines need a way to prioritize their crawl-to determine which pages to recrawl, how frequently, and how often to seek out new pages. Among other factors, the static rank of a page is used to determine this prioritization. A better static rank thus provides the engine with a higher quality, more upto-date index. Google is often regarded as the first commercially successful search engine. Their ranking was originally based on the PageRank algorithm [5][27]. Due to this (and possibly due to Googles promotion of PageRank to the public), PageRank is widely regarded as the best method for the static ranking of Web pages. Though PageRank has historically been thought to perform quite well, there has yet been little academic evidence to support this claim. Even worse, there has recently been work showing that PageRank may not perform any better than other simple measures on certain tasks. Upstill et al. have found that for the task of finding home pages, the number of pages linking to a page and the type of URL were as, or more, effective than PageRank [32]. They found similar results for the task of finding high quality companies [31]. PageRank has also been used in systems for TRECs very large collection and Web track competitions, but with much less success than had been expected [17]. Finally, Amento et al. [1] found that simple features, such as the number of pages on a site, performed as well as PageRank. Despite these, the general belief remains among many, both academic and in the public, that PageRank is an essential factor for a good static rank. Failing this, it is still assumed that using the link structure is crucial, in the form of the number of inlinks or the amount of anchor text. In this paper, we show there are a number of simple url- or pagebased features that significantly outperform PageRank (for the purposes of statically ranking Web pages) despite ignoring the structure of the Web. We combine these and other static features using machine learning to achieve a ranking system that is significantly better than PageRank (in pairwise agreement with human labels). A machine learning approach for static ranking has other advantages besides the quality of the ranking. Because the measure consists of many features, it is harder for malicious users to manipulate it (i.e., to raise their pages static rank to an undeserved level through questionable techniques, also known as Web spamming). This is particularly true if the feature set is not known. In contrast, a single measure like PageRank can be easier to manipulate because spammers need only concentrate on one goal: how to cause more pages to point to their page. With an algorithm that learns, a feature that becomes unusable due to spammer manipulation will simply be reduced or removed from the final computation of rank. This flexibility allows a ranking system to rapidly react to new spamming techniques. A machine learning approach to static ranking is also able to take advantage of any advances in the machine learning field. For example, recent work on adversarial classification [12] suggests that it may be possible to explicitly model the Web page spammers (the adversary) actions, adjusting the ranking model in advance of the spammers attempts to circumvent it. Another example is the elimination of outliers in constructing the model, which helps reduce the effect that unique sites may have on the overall quality of the static rank. By moving static ranking to a machine learning framework, we not only gain in accuracy, but also gain in the ability to react to spammers actions, to rapidly add new features to the ranking algorithm, and to leverage advances in the rapidly growing field of machine learning. Finally, we believe there will be significant advantages to using this technique for other domains, such as searching a local hard drive or a corporations intranet. These are domains where the link structure is particularly weak (or non-existent), but there are other domain-specific features that could be just as powerful. For example, the author of an intranet page and his/her position in the organization (e.g., CEO, manager, or developer) could provide significant clues as to the importance of that page. A machine learning approach thus allows rapid development of a good static algorithm in new domains. This papers contribution is a systematic study of static features, including PageRank, for the purposes of (statically) ranking Web pages. Previous studies on PageRank typically used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g., the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages). Also, the performance of PageRank and other static features has typically been evaluated in the context of a complete system for dynamic ranking, or for other tasks such as question answering. In contrast, we explore the use of PageRank and other features for the direct task of statically ranking Web pages. We first briefly describe the PageRank algorithm. In Section 3 we introduce RankNet, the machine learning technique used to combine static features into a final ranking. Section 4 describes the static features. The heart of the paper is in Section 5, which presents our experiments and results. We conclude with a discussion of related and future work. 2. PAGERANK The basic idea behind PageRank is simple: a link from a Web page to another can be seen as an endorsement of that page. In general, links are made by people. As such, they are indicative of the quality of the pages to which they point - when creating a page, an author presumably chooses to link to pages deemed to be of good quality. We can take advantage of this linkage information to order Web pages according to their perceived quality. Imagine a Web surfer who jumps from Web page to Web page, choosing with uniform probability which link to follow at each step. In order to reduce the effect of dead-ends or endless cycles the surfer will occasionally jump to a random page with some small probability α, or when on a page with no out-links. If averaged over a sufficient number of steps, the probability the surfer is on page j at some point in time is given by the formula: ∑∈ + − = ji i iP N jP B F )()1( )( α α (1) Where Fi is the set of pages that page i links to, and Bj is the set of pages that link to page j. The PageRank score for node j is defined as this probability: PR(j)=P(j). Because equation (1) is recursive, it must be iteratively evaluated until P(j) converges (typically, the initial distribution for P(j) is uniform). The intuition is, because a random surfer would end up at the page more frequently, it is likely a better page. An alternative view for equation (1) is that each page is assigned a quality, P(j). A page gives an equal share of its quality to each page it points to. PageRank is computationally expensive. Our collection of 5 billion pages contains approximately 370 billion links. Computing PageRank requires iterating over these billions of links multiple times (until convergence). It requires large amounts of memory (or very smart caching schemes that slow the computation down even further), and if spread across multiple machines, requires significant communication between them. Though much work has been done on optimizing the PageRank computation (see e.g., [25] and [6]), it remains a relatively slow, computationally expensive property to compute. 3. RANKNET Much work in machine learning has been done on the problems of classification and regression. Let X={xi} be a collection of feature vectors (typically, a feature is any real valued number), and Y={yi} be a collection of associated classes, where yi is the class of the object described by feature vector xi. The classification problem is to learn a function f that maps yi=f(xi), for all i. When yi is real-valued as well, this is called regression. Static ranking can be seen as a regression problem. If we let xi represent features of page i, and yi be a value (say, the rank) for each page, we could learn a regression function that mapped each pages features to their rank. However, this over-constrains the problem we wish to solve. All we really care about is the order of the pages, not the actual value assigned to them. Recent work on this ranking problem [7][13][18] directly attempts to optimize the ordering of the objects, rather than the value assigned to them. For these, let Z={<i,j>} be a collection of pairs of items, where item i should be assigned a higher value than item j. The goal of the ranking problem, then, is to learn a function f such that, )()(,, ji ffji xxZ >∈∀ 708 Note that, as with learning a regression function, the result of this process is a function (f) that maps feature vectors to real values. This function can still be applied anywhere that a regressionlearned function could be applied. The only difference is the technique used to learn the function. By directly optimizing the ordering of objects, these methods are able to learn a function that does a better job of ranking than do regression techniques. We used RankNet [7], one of the aforementioned techniques for learning ranking functions, to learn our static rank function. RankNet is a straightforward modification to the standard neural network back-prop algorithm. As with back-prop, RankNet attempts to minimize the value of a cost function by adjusting each weight in the network according to the gradient of the cost function with respect to that weight. The difference is that, while a typical neural network cost function is based on the difference between the network output and the desired output, the RankNet cost function is based on the difference between a pair of network outputs. That is, for each pair of feature vectors <i,j> in the training set, RankNet computes the network outputs oi and oj. Since vector i is supposed to be ranked higher than vector j, the larger is oj-oi, the larger the cost. RankNet also allows the pairs in Z to be weighted with a confidence (posed as the probability that the pair satisfies the ordering induced by the ranking function). In this paper, we used a probability of one for all pairs. In the next section, we will discuss the features used in our feature vectors, xi. 4. FEATURES To apply RankNet (or other machine learning techniques) to the ranking problem, we needed to extract a set of features from each page. We divided our feature set into four, mutually exclusive, categories: page-level (Page), domain-level (Domain), anchor text and inlinks (Anchor), and popularity (Popularity). We also optionally used the PageRank of a page as a feature. Below, we describe each of these feature categories in more detail. PageRank We computed PageRank on a Web graph of 5 billion crawled pages (and 20 billion known URLs linked to by these pages). This represents a significant portion of the Web, and is approximately the same number of pages as are used by Google, Yahoo, and MSN for their search engines. Because PageRank is a graph-based algorithm, it is important that it be run on as large a subset of the Web as possible. Most previous studies on PageRank used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g. the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages) We computed PageRank using the standard value of 0.85 for α. Popularity Another feature we used is the actual popularity of a Web page, measured as the number of times that it has been visited by users over some period of time. We have access to such data from users who have installed the MSN toolbar and have opted to provide it to MSN. The data is aggregated into a count, for each Web page, of the number of users who viewed that page. Though popularity data is generally unavailable, there are two other sources for it. The first is from proxy logs. For example, a university that requires its students to use a proxy has a record of all the pages they have visited while on campus. Unfortunately, proxy data is quite biased and relatively small. Another source, internal to search engines, are records of which results their users clicked on. Such data was used by the search engine Direct Hit, and has recently been explored for dynamic ranking purposes [20]. An advantage of the toolbar data over this is that it contains information about URL visits that are not just the result of a search. The raw popularity is processed into a number of features such as the number of times a page was viewed and the number of times any page in the domain was viewed. More details are provided in section 5.5. Anchor text and inlinks These features are based on the information associated with links to the page in question. It includes features such as the total amount of text in links pointing to the page (anchor text), the number of unique words in that text, etc. Page This category consists of features which may be determined by looking at the page (and its URL) alone. We used only eight, simple features such as the number of words in the body, the frequency of the most common term, etc. Domain This category contains features that are computed as averages across all pages in the domain. For example, the average number of outlinks on any page and the average PageRank. Many of these features have been used by others for ranking Web pages, particularly the anchor and page features. As mentioned, the evaluation is typically for dynamic ranking, and we wish to evaluate the use of them for static ranking. Also, to our knowledge, this is the first study on the use of actual page visitation popularity for static ranking. The closest similar work is on using click-through behavior (that is, which search engine results the users click on) to affect dynamic ranking (see e.g., [20]). Because we use a wide variety of features to come up with a static ranking, we refer to this as fRank (for feature-based ranking). fRank uses RankNet and the set of features described in this section to learn a ranking function for Web pages. Unless otherwise specified, fRank was trained with all of the features. 5. EXPERIMENTS In this section, we will demonstrate that we can out perform PageRank by applying machine learning to a straightforward set of features. Before the results, we first discuss the data, the performance metric, and the training method. 5.1 Data In order to evaluate the quality of a static ranking, we needed a gold standard defining the correct ordering for a set of pages. For this, we employed a dataset which contains human judgments for 28000 queries. For each query, a number of results are manually assigned a rating, from 0 to 4, by human judges. The rating is meant to be a measure of how relevant the result is for the query, where 0 means poor and 4 means excellent. There are approximately 500k judgments in all, or an average of 18 ratings per query. The queries are selected by randomly choosing queries from among those issued to the MSN search engine. The probability that a query is selected is proportional to its frequency among all 709 of the queries. As a result, common queries are more likely to be judged than uncommon queries. As an example of how diverse the queries are, the first four queries in the training set are chef schools, chicagoland speedway, eagles fan club, and Turkish culture. The documents selected for judging are those that we expected would, on average, be reasonably relevant (for example, the top ten documents returned by MSNs search engine). This provides significantly more information than randomly selecting documents on the Web, the vast majority of which would be irrelevant to a given query. Because of this process, the judged pages tend to be of higher quality than the average page on the Web, and tend to be pages that will be returned for common search queries. This bias is good when evaluating the quality of static ranking for the purposes of index ordering and returning relevant documents. This is because the most important portion of the index to be well-ordered and relevant is the portion that is frequently returned for search queries. Because of this bias, however, the results in this paper are not applicable to crawl prioritization. In order to obtain experimental results on crawl prioritization, we would need ratings on a random sample of Web pages. To convert the data from query-dependent to query-independent, we simply removed the query, taking the maximum over judgments for a URL that appears in more than one query. The reasoning behind this is that a page that is relevant for some query and irrelevant for another is probably a decent page and should have a high static rank. Because we evaluated the pages on queries that occur frequently, our data indicates the correct index ordering, and assigns high value to pages that are likely to be relevant to a common query. We randomly assigned queries to a training, validation, or test set, such that they contained 84%, 8%, and 8% of the queries, respectively. Each set contains all of the ratings for a given query, and no query appears in more than one set. The training set was used to train fRank. The validation set was used to select the model that had the highest performance. The test set was used for the final results. This data gives us a query-independent ordering of pages. The goal for a static ranking algorithm will be to reproduce this ordering as closely as possible. In the next section, we describe the measure we used to evaluate this. 5.2 Measure We chose to use pairwise accuracy to evaluate the quality of a static ranking. The pairwise accuracy is the fraction of time that the ranking algorithm and human judges agree on the ordering of a pair of Web pages. If S(x) is the static ranking assigned to page x, and H(x) is the human judgment of relevance for x, then consider the following sets: )}()(:,{ yHxHyx >=pH and )}()(:,{ ySxSyx >=pS The pairwise accuracy is the portion of Hp that is also contained in Sp: p pp H SH ∩ =accuracypairwise This measure was chosen for two reasons. First, the discrete human judgments provide only a partial ordering over Web pages, making it difficult to apply a measure such as the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (in the pairwise accuracy measure, a pair of documents with the same human judgment does not affect the score). Second, the pairwise accuracy has an intuitive meaning: it is the fraction of pairs of documents that, when the humans claim one is better than the other, the static rank algorithm orders them correctly. 5.3 Method We trained fRank (a RankNet based neural network) using the following parameters. We used a fully connected 2 layer network. The hidden layer had 10 hidden nodes. The input weights to this layer were all initialized to be zero. The output layer (just a single node) weights were initialized using a uniform random distribution in the range [-0.1, 0.1]. We used tanh as the transfer function from the inputs to the hidden layer, and a linear function from the hidden layer to the output. The cost function is the pairwise cross entropy cost function as discussed in section 3. The features in the training set were normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. The same linear transformation was then applied to the features in the validation and test sets. For training, we presented the network with 5 million pairings of pages, where one page had a higher rating than the other. The pairings were chosen uniformly at random (with replacement) from all possible pairings. When forming the pairs, we ignored the magnitude of the difference between the ratings (the rating spread) for the two URLs. Hence, the weight for each pair was constant (one), and the probability of a pair being selected was independent of its rating spread. We trained the network for 30 epochs. On each epoch, the training pairs were randomly shuffled. The initial training rate was 0.001. At each epoch, we checked the error on the training set. If the error had increased, then we decreased the training rate, under the hypothesis that the network had probably overshot. The training rate at each epoch was thus set to: Training rate = 1+ε κ Where κ is the initial rate (0.001), and ε is the number of times the training set error has increased. After each epoch, we measured the performance of the neural network on the validation set, using 1 million pairs (chosen randomly with replacement). The network with the highest pairwise accuracy on the validation set was selected, and then tested on the test set. We report the pairwise accuracy on the test set, calculated using all possible pairs. These parameters were determined and fixed before the static rank experiments in this paper. In particular, the choice of initial training rate, number of epochs, and training rate decay function were taken directly from Burges et al [7]. Though we had the option of preprocessing any of the features before they were input to the neural network, we refrained from doing so on most of them. The only exception was the popularity features. As with most Web phenomenon, we found that the distribution of site popularity is Zipfian. To reduce the dynamic range, and hopefully make the feature more useful, we presented the network with both the unpreprocessed, as well as the logarithm, of the popularity features (As with the others, the logarithmic feature values were also normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation). 710 Applying fRank to a document is computationally efficient, taking time that is only linear in the number of input features; it is thus within a constant factor of other simple machine learning methods such as naïve Bayes. In our experiments, computing the fRank for all five billion Web pages was approximately 100 times faster than computing the PageRank for the same set. 5.4 Results As Table 1 shows, fRank significantly outperforms PageRank for the purposes of static ranking. With a pairwise accuracy of 67.4%, fRank more than doubles the accuracy of PageRank (relative to the baseline of 50%, which is the accuracy that would be achieved by a random ordering of Web pages). Note that one of fRanks input features is the PageRank of the page, so we would expect it to perform no worse than PageRank. The significant increase in accuracy implies that the other features (anchor, popularity, etc.) do in fact contain useful information regarding the overall quality of a page. Table 1: Basic Results Technique Accuracy (%) None (Baseline) 50.00 PageRank 56.70 fRank 67.43 There are a number of decisions that go into the computation of PageRank, such as how to deal with pages that have no outlinks, the choice of α, numeric precision, convergence threshold, etc. We were able to obtain a computation of PageRank from a completely independent implementation (provided by Marc Najork) that varied somewhat in these parameters. It achieved a pairwise accuracy of 56.52%, nearly identical to that obtained by our implementation. We thus concluded that the quality of the PageRank is not sensitive to these minor variations in algorithm, nor was PageRanks low accuracy due to problems with our implementation of it. We also wanted to find how well each feature set performed. To answer this, for each feature set, we trained and tested fRank using only that set of features. The results are shown in Table 2. As can be seen, every single feature set individually outperformed PageRank on this test. Perhaps the most interesting result is that the Page-level features had the highest performance out of all the feature sets. This is surprising because these are features that do not depend on the overall graph structure of the Web, nor even on what pages point to a given page. This is contrary to the common belief that the Web graph structure is the key to finding a good static ranking of Web pages. Table 2: Results for individual feature sets. Feature Set Accuracy (%) PageRank 56.70 Popularity 60.82 Anchor 59.09 Page 63.93 Domain 59.03 All Features 67.43 Because we are using a two-layer neural network, the features in the learned network can interact with each other in interesting, nonlinear ways. This means that a particular feature that appears to have little value in isolation could actually be very important when used in combination with other features. To measure the final contribution of a feature set, in the context of all the other features, we performed an ablation study. That is, for each set of features, we trained a network to contain all of the features except that set. We then compared the performance of the resulting network to the performance of the network with all of the features. Table 3 shows the results of this experiment, where the decrease in accuracy is the difference in pairwise accuracy between the network trained with all of the features, and the network missing the given feature set. Table 3: Ablation study. Shown is the decrease in accuracy when we train a network that has all but the given set of features. The last line is shows the effect of removing the anchor, PageRank, and domain features, hence a model containing no network or link-based information whatsoever. Feature Set Decrease in Accuracy PageRank 0.18 Popularity 0.78 Anchor 0.47 Page 5.42 Domain Anchor, PageRank & Domain 0.10 0.60 The results of the ablation study are consistent with the individual feature set study. Both show that the most important feature set is the Page-level feature set, and the second most important is the popularity feature set. Finally, we wished to see how the performance of fRank improved as we added features; we wanted to find at what point adding more feature sets became relatively useless. Beginning with no features, we greedily added the feature set that improved performance the most. The results are shown in Table 4. For example, the fourth line of the table shows that fRank using the page, popularity, and anchor features outperformed any network that used the page, popularity, and some other feature set, and that the performance of this network was 67.25%. Table 4: fRank performance as feature sets are added. At each row, the feature set that gave the greatest increase in accuracy was added to the list of features (i.e., we conducted a greedy search over feature sets). Feature Set Accuracy (%) None 50.00 +Page 63.93 +Popularity 66.83 +Anchor 67.25 +PageRank 67.31 +Domain 67.43 711 Finally, we present a qualitative comparison of PageRank vs. fRank. In Table 5 are the top ten URLs returned for PageRank and for fRank. PageRanks results are heavily weighted towards technology sites. It contains two QuickTime URLs (Apples video playback software), as well as Internet Explorer and FireFox URLs (both of which are Web browsers). fRank, on the other hand, contains more consumer-oriented sites such as American Express, Target, Dell, etc. PageRanks bias toward technology can be explained through two processes. First, there are many pages with buttons at the bottom suggesting that the site is optimized for Internet Explorer, or that the visitor needs QuickTime. These generally link back to, in these examples, the Internet Explorer and QuickTime download sites. Consequently, PageRank ranks those pages highly. Though these pages are important, they are not as important as it may seem by looking at the link structure alone. One fix for this is to add information about the link to the PageRank computation, such as the size of the text, whether it was at the bottom of the page, etc. The other bias comes from the fact that the population of Web site authors is different than the population of Web users. Web authors tend to be technologically-oriented, and thus their linking behavior reflects those interests. fRank, by knowing the actual visitation popularity of a site (the popularity feature set), is able to eliminate some of that bias. It has the ability to depend more on where actual Web users visit rather than where the Web site authors have linked. The results confirm that fRank outperforms PageRank in pairwise accuracy. The two most important feature sets are the page and popularity features. This is surprising, as the page features consisted only of a few (8) simple features. Further experiments found that, of the page features, those based on the text of the page (as opposed to the URL) performed the best. In the next section, we explore the popularity feature in more detail. 5.5 Popularity Data As mentioned in section 4, our popularity data came from MSN toolbar users. For privacy reasons, we had access only to an aggregate count of, for each URL, how many times it was visited by any toolbar user. This limited the possible features we could derive from this data. For possible extensions, see section 6.3, future work. For each URL in our train and test sets, we provided a feature to fRank which was how many times it had been visited by a toolbar user. However, this feature was quite noisy and sparse, particularly for URLs with query parameters (e.g., http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=machine+learning&form=QBHP). One solution was to provide an additional feature which was the number of times any URL at the given domain was visited by a toolbar user. Adding this feature dramatically improved the performance of fRank. We took this one step further and used the built-in hierarchical structure of URLs to construct many levels of backoff between the full URL and the domain. We did this by using the set of features shown in Table 6. Table 6: URL functions used to compute the Popularity feature set. Function Example Exact URL cnn.com/2005/tech/wikipedia.html?v=mobile No Params cnn.com/2005/tech/wikipedia.html Page wikipedia.html URL-1 cnn.com/2005/tech URL-2 cnn.com/2005 … Domain cnn.com Domain+1 cnn.com/2005 … Each URL was assigned one feature for each function shown in the table. The value of the feature was the count of the number of times a toolbar user visited a URL, where the function applied to that URL matches the function applied to the URL in question. For example, a users visit to cnn.com/2005/sports.html would increment the Domain and Domain+1 features for the URL cnn.com/2005/tech/wikipedia.html. As seen in Table 7, adding the domain counts significantly improved the quality of the popularity feature, and adding the numerous backoff functions listed in Table 6 improved the accuracy even further. Table 7: Effect of adding backoff to the popularity feature set Features Accuracy (%) URL count 58.15 URL and Domain counts 59.31 All backoff functions (Table 6) 60.82 Table 5: Top ten URLs for PageRank vs. fRank PageRank fRank google.com google.com apple.com/quicktime/download yahoo.com amazon.com americanexpress.com yahoo.com hp.com microsoft.com/windows/ie target.com apple.com/quicktime bestbuy.com mapquest.com dell.com ebay.com autotrader.com mozilla.org/products/firefox dogpile.com ftc.gov bankofamerica.com 712 Backing off to subsets of the URL is one technique for dealing with the sparsity of data. It is also informative to see how the performance of fRank depends on the amount of popularity data that we have collected. In Figure 1 we show the performance of fRank trained with only the popularity feature set vs. the amount of data we have for the popularity feature set. Each day, we receive additional popularity data, and as can be seen in the plot, this increases the performance of fRank. The relation is logarithmic: doubling the amount of popularity data provides a constant improvement in pairwise accuracy. In summary, we have found that the popularity features provide a useful boost to the overall fRank accuracy. Gathering more popularity data, as well as employing simple backoff strategies, improve this boost even further. 5.6 Summary of Results The experiments provide a number of conclusions. First, fRank performs significantly better than PageRank, even without any information about the Web graph. Second, the page level and popularity features were the most significant contributors to pairwise accuracy. Third, by collecting more popularity data, we can continue to improve fRanks performance. The popularity data provides two benefits to fRank. First, we see that qualitatively, fRanks ordering of Web pages has a more favorable bias than PageRanks. fRanks ordering seems to correspond to what Web users, rather than Web page authors, prefer. Second, the popularity data is more timely than PageRanks link information. The toolbar provides information about which Web pages people find interesting right now, whereas links are added to pages more slowly, as authors find the time and interest. 6. RELATED AND FUTURE WORK 6.1 Improvements to PageRank Since the original PageRank paper, there has been work on improving it. Much of that work centers on speeding up and parallelizing the computation [15][25]. One recognized problem with PageRank is that of topic drift: A page about dogs will have high PageRank if it is linked to by many pages that themselves have high rank, regardless of their topic. In contrast, a search engine user looking for good pages about dogs would likely prefer to find pages that are pointed to by many pages that are themselves about dogs. Hence, a link that is on topic should have higher weight than a link that is not. Richardson and Domingoss Query Dependent PageRank [29] and Haveliwalas Topic-Sensitive PageRank [16] are two approaches that tackle this problem. Other variations to PageRank include differently weighting links for inter- vs. intra-domain links, adding a backwards step to the random surfer to simulate the back button on most browsers [24] and modifying the jump probability (α) [3]. See Langville and Meyer [23] for a good survey of these, and other modifications to PageRank. 6.2 Other related work PageRank is not the only link analysis algorithm used for ranking Web pages. The most well-known other is HITS [22], which is used by the Teoma search engine [30]. HITS produces a list of hubs and authorities, where hubs are pages that point to many authority pages, and authorities are pages that are pointed to by many hubs. Previous work has shown HITS to perform comparably to PageRank [1]. One field of interest is that of static index pruning (see e.g., Carmel et al. [8]). Static index pruning methods reduce the size of the search engines index by removing documents that are unlikely to be returned by a search query. The pruning is typically done based on the frequency of query terms. Similarly, Pandey and Olston [28] suggest crawling pages frequently if they are likely to incorrectly appear (or not appear) as a result of a search. Similar methods could be incorporated into the static rank (e.g., how many frequent queries contain words found on this page). Others have investigated the effect that PageRank has on the Web at large [9]. They argue that pages with high PageRank are more likely to be found by Web users, thus more likely to be linked to, and thus more likely to maintain a higher PageRank than other pages. The same may occur for the popularity data. If we increase the ranking for popular pages, they are more likely to be clicked on, thus further increasing their popularity. Cho et al. [10] argue that a more appropriate measure of Web page quality would depend on not only the current link structure of the Web, but also on the change in that link structure. The same technique may be applicable to popularity data: the change in popularity of a page may be more informative than the absolute popularity. One interesting related work is that of Ivory and Hearst [19]. Their goal was to build a model of Web sites that are considered high quality from the perspective of content, structure and navigation, visual design, functionality, interactivity, and overall experience. They used over 100 page level features, as well as features encompassing the performance and structure of the site. This let them qualitatively describe the qualities of a page that make it appear attractive (e.g., rare use of italics, at least 9 point font, …), and (in later work) to build a system that assists novel Web page authors in creating quality pages by evaluating it according to these features. The primary differences between this work and ours are the goal (discovering what constitutes a good Web page vs. ordering Web pages for the purposes of Web search), the size of the study (they used a dataset of less than 6000 pages vs. our set of 468,000), and our comparison with PageRank. y = 0.577Ln(x) + 58.283 R 2 = 0.9822 58 58.5 59 59.5 60 60.5 61 1 10 100 Days of Toolbar Data PairwiseAccuracy Figure 1: Relation between the amount of popularity data and the performance of the popularity feature set. Note the x-axis is a logarithmic scale. 713 Nevertheless, their work provides insights to additional useful static features that we could incorporate into fRank in the future. Recent work on incorporating novel features into dynamic ranking includes that by Joachims et al. [21], who investigate the use of implicit feedback from users, in the form of which search engine results are clicked on. Craswell et al. [11] present a method for determining the best transformation to apply to query independent features (such as those used in this paper) for the purposes of improving dynamic ranking. Other work, such as Boyan et al. [4] and Bartell et al. [2] apply machine learning for the purposes of improving the overall relevance of a search engine (i.e., the dynamic ranking). They do not apply their techniques to the problem of static ranking. 6.3 Future work There are many ways in which we would like to extend this work. First, fRank uses only a small number of features. We believe we could achieve even more significant results with more features. In particular the existence, or lack thereof, of certain words could prove very significant (for instance, under construction probably signifies a low quality page). Other features could include the number of images on a page, size of those images, number of layout elements (tables, divs, and spans), use of style sheets, conforming to W3C standards (like XHTML 1.0 Strict), background color of a page, etc. Many pages are generated dynamically, the contents of which may depend on parameters in the URL, the time of day, the user visiting the site, or other variables. For such pages, it may be useful to apply the techniques found in [26] to form a static approximation for the purposes of extracting features. The resulting grammar describing the page could itself be a source of additional features describing the complexity of the page, such as how many non-terminal nodes it has, the depth of the grammar tree, etc. fRank allows one to specify a confidence in each pairing of documents. In the future, we will experiment with probabilities that depend on the difference in human judgments between the two items in the pair. For example, a pair of documents where one was rated 4 and the other 0 should have a higher confidence than a pair of documents rated 3 and 2. The experiments in this paper are biased toward pages that have higher than average quality. Also, fRank with all of the features can only be applied to pages that have already been crawled. Thus, fRank is primarily useful for index ordering and improving relevance, not for directing the crawl. We would like to investigate a machine learning approach for crawl prioritization as well. It may be that a combination of methods is best: for example, using PageRank to select the best 5 billion of the 20 billion pages on the Web, then using fRank to order the index and affect search relevancy. Another interesting direction for exploration is to incorporate fRank and page-level features directly into the PageRank computation itself. Work on biasing the PageRank jump vector [16], and transition matrix [29], have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of such an approach. There is reason to believe that a direct application of [29], using the fRank of a page for its relevance, could lead to an improved overall static rank. Finally, the popularity data can be used in other interesting ways. The general surfing and searching habits of Web users varies by time of day. Activity in the morning, daytime, and evening are often quite different (e.g., reading the news, solving problems, and accessing entertainment, respectively). We can gain insight into these differences by using the popularity data, divided into segments of the day. When a query is issued, we would then use the popularity data matching the time of query in order to do the ranking of Web pages. We also plan to explore popularity features that use more than just the counts of how often a page was visited. For example, how long users tended to dwell on a page, did they leave the page by clicking a link or by hitting the back button, etc. Fox et al. did a study that showed that features such as this can be valuable for the purposes of dynamic ranking [14]. Finally, the popularity data could be used as the label rather than as a feature. Using fRank in this way to predict the popularity of a page may useful for the tasks of relevance, efficiency, and crawl priority. There is also significantly more popularity data than human labeled data, potentially enabling more complex machine learning methods, and significantly more features. 7. CONCLUSIONS A good static ranking is an important component for todays search engines and information retrieval systems. We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank. By combining many static features, fRank achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise accuracy than PageRank alone. A qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that Web users, rather than Web authors, visit. The machine learning component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further developments in the machine learning community in areas such as adversarial classification. We have only begun to explore the options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the area of static ranking by further experimentation with additional features, other machine learning techniques, and additional sources of data. 8.

Mostramos que podemos superar significativamente a PageRank utilizando características que son independientes de la estructura de enlace de la web. Obtuvimos un aumento adicional en la precisión mediante el uso de datos sobre la frecuencia en que los usuarios visitan páginas web. Utilizamos RankNet, un algoritmo de aprendizaje automático de clasificación, para combinar estas y otras características estáticas basadas en el texto de anclaje y las características de dominio. El modelo resultante logra una precisión de clasificación estática por pares de 67.3% (frente a 56.7% para PageRank o 50% para aleatorio).

Algoritmos de términos generales, medición, rendimiento, experimentación.1. Introducción En la última década, la web ha crecido exponencialmente en tamaño. Desafortunadamente, este crecimiento no se ha aislado a páginas de buena calidad. El número de sitios incorrectos, spam y maliciosos (por ejemplo, phishing) también ha crecido rápidamente. El gran número de páginas buenas y malas en la web ha llevado a una creciente dependencia de los motores de búsqueda para el descubrimiento de información útil. Los usuarios confían en los motores de búsqueda no solo para devolver páginas relacionadas con su consulta de búsqueda, sino también para separar el bien de lo malo y los resultados de orden para que las mejores páginas se sugieran primero. Hasta la fecha, la mayoría de los trabajos en la clasificación de la página web se ha centrado en mejorar el orden de los resultados que se devuelven al usuario (clasificación de consultas o clasificación dinámica). Sin embargo, tener una buena clasificación independiente de la consulta (clasificación estática) también es de manera crucial para un motor de búsqueda. Un buen algoritmo de clasificación estática proporciona numerosos beneficios: • Relevancia: el rango estático de una página proporciona un indicador general de la calidad general de la página. Esta es una entrada útil para el algoritmo de clasificación dinámica.• Eficiencia: típicamente, el índice de motores de búsqueda está ordenado por rango estático. Al atravesar el índice de alta calidad a páginas de baja calidad, el ranker dinámico puede abortar la búsqueda cuando determina que ninguna página posterior tendrá un rango dinámico tan alto como los ya encontrados. Cuanto más preciso sea el rango estático, mejor esta habilidad de parto temprano y, por lo tanto, más rápido puede responder el motor de búsqueda a las consultas.• Prioridad de rastreo: la web crece y cambia tan rápido como los motores de búsqueda pueden rastrearla. Los motores de búsqueda necesitan una forma de priorizar su rastreo para determinar qué páginas reclazar, con qué frecuencia y con qué frecuencia buscar nuevas páginas. Entre otros factores, el rango estático de una página se utiliza para determinar esta priorización. Un mejor rango estático proporciona al motor un índice de mayor calidad y más actualizado. Google a menudo se considera el primer motor de búsqueda comercialmente exitoso. Su clasificación se basó originalmente en el algoritmo de PageRank [5] [27]. Debido a esto (y posiblemente debido a la promoción de Googles de PageRank al público), PageRank es ampliamente considerado como el mejor método para la clasificación estática de las páginas web. Aunque históricamente se ha pensado que PageRank se desempeña bastante bien, aún ha habido poca evidencia académica para respaldar esta afirmación. Peor aún, recientemente ha habido trabajo que muestra que PageRank puede no funcionar mejor que otras medidas simples en ciertas tareas. Upstill et al.han descubierto que para la tarea de encontrar páginas de inicio, el número de páginas que vinculan a una página y el tipo de URL fueron como o más efectivos que PageRank [32]. Encontraron resultados similares para la tarea de encontrar compañías de alta calidad [31]. PageRank también se ha utilizado en sistemas para TRECS muy grandes concursos de colección y pista web, pero con mucho menos éxito de lo esperado [17]. Finalmente, Amento et al.[1] encontraron que las características simples, como el número de páginas en un sitio, se realizan así como PageRank. A pesar de estos, la creencia general sigue siendo entre muchos, tanto académicos como en el público, que PageRank es un factor esencial para un buen rango estático. No se supone que no se supone que usar la estructura del enlace es crucial, en forma del número de insultos o la cantidad de texto de anclaje. En este artículo, mostramos que hay una serie de características simples a base de URL o página que superan significativamente a PageRank (a los efectos de las páginas web de clasificación estáticamente) a pesar de ignorar la estructura de la web. Combinamos estas y otras características estáticas utilizando el aprendizaje automático para lograr un sistema de clasificación que sea significativamente mejor que PageRank (en un acuerdo por pares con etiquetas humanas). Un enfoque de aprendizaje automático para la clasificación estática tiene otras ventajas además de la calidad de la clasificación. Debido a que la medida consta de muchas características, es más difícil para los usuarios maliciosos manipularla (es decir, elevar sus páginas de rango estático a un nivel inmerecido a través de técnicas cuestionables, también conocidas como spam web). Esto es particularmente cierto si no se conoce el conjunto de características. Por el contrario, una sola medida como PageRank puede ser más fácil de manipular porque los spammers solo necesitan concentrarse en un objetivo: cómo hacer que más páginas apunten a su página. Con un algoritmo que aprende, una característica que se vuelve inutilizable debido a la manipulación de spammer simplemente se reducirá o eliminará del cálculo final del rango. Esta flexibilidad permite que un sistema de clasificación reaccione rápidamente a las nuevas técnicas de spam. Un enfoque de aprendizaje automático para la clasificación estática también puede aprovechar cualquier avance en el campo de aprendizaje automático. Por ejemplo, el trabajo reciente sobre la clasificación adversa [12] sugiere que puede ser posible modelar explícitamente las acciones de spammers de la página web (el adversario), ajustando el modelo de clasificación antes de los intentos de los spammers para eludirlo. Otro ejemplo es la eliminación de los valores atípicos en la construcción del modelo, lo que ayuda a reducir el efecto que los sitios únicos pueden tener en la calidad general del rango estático. Al mover la clasificación estática a un marco de aprendizaje automático, no solo ganamos con precisión, sino también ganamos la capacidad de reaccionar ante las acciones de Spammers, para agregar rápidamente nuevas características al algoritmo de clasificación y aprovechar los avances en el campo de rápido crecimiento de la máquina.aprendiendo. Finalmente, creemos que habrá ventajas significativas en el uso de esta técnica para otros dominios, como buscar un disco duro local o una intranet de las corporaciones. Estos son dominios en los que la estructura del enlace es particularmente débil (o inexistente), pero hay otras características específicas del dominio que podrían ser igual de potentes. Por ejemplo, el autor de una página de Intranet y su posición en la organización (por ejemplo, CEO, gerente o desarrollador) podría proporcionar pistas significativas sobre la importancia de esa página. Por lo tanto, un enfoque de aprendizaje automático permite el rápido desarrollo de un buen algoritmo estático en los nuevos dominios. Esta contribución de documentos es un estudio sistemático de las características estáticas, incluida PageRank, a los efectos de las páginas web de clasificación (estáticamente). Estudios anteriores sobre PageRank típicamente usan subconjuntos de la web que son significativamente más pequeños (por ejemplo, el Corpus TREC VLC2, utilizado por muchos, contiene solo 19 millones de páginas). Además, el rendimiento de PageRank y otras características estáticas se ha evaluado típicamente en el contexto de un sistema completo para la clasificación dinámica, o para otras tareas, como la respuesta a las preguntas. Por el contrario, exploramos el uso de PageRank y otras características para la tarea directa de las páginas web de clasificación estáticamente. Primero describimos brevemente el algoritmo de PageRank. En la Sección 3 presentamos RankNet, la técnica de aprendizaje automático utilizada para combinar características estáticas en una clasificación final. La Sección 4 describe las características estáticas. El corazón del documento se encuentra en la Sección 5, que presenta nuestros experimentos y resultados. Concluimos con una discusión sobre el trabajo relacionado y futuro.2. Pagerank La idea básica detrás de PageRank es simple: un enlace de una página web a otra puede verse como un respaldo de esa página. En general, los enlaces son hechos por personas. Como tal, son indicativos de la calidad de las páginas a las que señalan: al crear una página, un autor presumiblemente elige vincular a las páginas que se consideran de buena calidad. Podemos aprovechar esta información de vinculación para ordenar páginas web de acuerdo con su calidad percibida. Imagine a un surfista web que salta de página web a página web, eligiendo con una probabilidad uniforme que enlace a seguir en cada paso. Para reducir el efecto de los ciclos sin salida o interminables, el surfista ocasionalmente saltará a una página aleatoria con una pequeña probabilidad α, o cuando está en una página sin enlaces externos. Si se promedia en un número suficiente de pasos, la probabilidad de que el surfista esté en la página J en algún momento viene dada por la fórmula: ∑∈ + - = Ji I ip n jp b f) () 1 () (α α (1) Donde Fi es el conjunto de páginas a las que la página I enlaza, y BJ es el conjunto de páginas que enlazan a la página j. La puntuación de PageRank para el nodo J se define como esta probabilidad: PR (J) = P (J). Debido a que la ecuación (1) es recursiva, debe evaluarse iterativamente hasta que p (j) converge (típicamente, la distribución inicial para p (j) es uniforme). La intuición es, porque un surfista aleatorio terminaría en la página con más frecuencia, es probable que sea una mejor página. Una vista alternativa para la ecuación (1) es que a cada página se le asigna una calidad, p (j). Una página ofrece una parte igual de su calidad a cada página a la que señala. PageRank es computacionalmente costoso. Nuestra colección de 5 mil millones de páginas contiene aproximadamente 370 mil millones de enlaces. Computing PageRank requiere iterarse sobre estos miles de millones de enlaces varias veces (hasta la convergencia). Requiere grandes cantidades de memoria (o esquemas de almacenamiento de almacenamiento muy inteligente que disminuyen aún más el cálculo), y si se extienden en múltiples máquinas, requiere una comunicación significativa entre ellas. Aunque se ha trabajado mucho para optimizar el cálculo de PageRank (ver, por ejemplo, [25] y [6]), sigue siendo una propiedad relativamente lenta y computacionalmente costosa para calcular.3. RankNet se ha realizado mucho trabajo en el aprendizaje automático sobre los problemas de clasificación y regresión. Sea x = {xi} una colección de vectores de características (por lo general, una característica es cualquier número valorado real), y y = {yi} es una colección de clases asociadas, donde yi es la clase del objeto descrito por características vector xi. El problema de clasificación es aprender una función f que mapea yi = f (xi), para todos i. Cuando Yi también tiene un valor real, esto se llama regresión. La clasificación estática puede verse como un problema de regresión. Si dejamos que Xi represente las características de la página I, y Yi sea un valor (por ejemplo, el rango) para cada página, podríamos aprender una función de regresión que mapeó cada página de las características a su rango. Sin embargo, esto limita demasiado el problema que deseamos resolver. Todo lo que realmente nos importa es el orden de las páginas, no el valor real que se les asigna. Trabajo reciente sobre este problema de clasificación [7] [13] [18] intenta optimizar directamente el orden de los objetos, en lugar del valor asignado a ellos. Para estos, deje que Z = {<i, j>} sea una colección de pares de elementos, donde el elemento me asignaran un valor más alto que el elemento j. El objetivo del problema de clasificación, entonces, es aprender una función f tal que, () () (,, ji ffji xxz> ∈∀ 708 Tenga en cuenta que, como con el aprendizaje de una función de regresión, el resultado de este proceso es una función (f) que mapas presentan vectores a valores reales. Esta función aún se puede aplicar en cualquier lugar para que se pueda aplicar una función de regresión. La única diferencia es la técnica utilizada para aprender la función. Al optimizar directamente el orden de los objetos, estos métodos pueden aprender una función que hace un mejor trabajo de clasificación que hacer técnicas de regresión. Utilizamos RankNet [7], una de las técnicas antes mencionadas para las funciones de clasificación de aprendizaje, para aprender nuestra función de rango estático. RankNET es una modificación directa al algoritmo estándar de la red neuronal posterior. Al igual que con Back-Prop, RankNet intenta minimizar el valor de una función de costo ajustando cada peso en la red de acuerdo con el gradiente de la función de costo con respecto a ese peso. La diferencia es que, si bien una función de costo de red neuronal típica se basa en la diferencia entre la salida de la red y la salida deseada, la función de costo RankNet se basa en la diferencia entre un par de salidas de red. Es decir, para cada par de vectores de características <i, j> En el conjunto de entrenamiento, RankNet calcula las salidas de red OI y OJ. Dado que se supone que el vector I se clasifica más alto que el vector j, cuanto más grande es oj-oi, mayor será el costo. RankNet también permite que los pares en Z se pondera con una confianza (planteada como la probabilidad de que el par satisfaga el orden inducido por la función de clasificación). En este artículo, utilizamos una probabilidad de uno para todos los pares. En la siguiente sección, discutiremos las características utilizadas en nuestros vectores de características, XI.4. Características Para aplicar RankNet (u otras técnicas de aprendizaje automático) al problema de clasificación, necesitábamos extraer un conjunto de características de cada página. Dividimos nuestra característica establecida en cuatro categorías mutuamente exclusivas, a nivel de página (página), nivel de dominio (dominio), texto de anclaje e inclinos (ancla) y popularidad (popularidad). También utilizamos opcionalmente el PageRank de una página como característica. A continuación, describimos cada una de estas categorías de características con más detalle. PageRank calculamos PageRank en un gráfico web de 5 mil millones de páginas rastreadas (y 20 mil millones de URL conocidas vinculadas por estas páginas). Esto representa una parte significativa de la web, y es aproximadamente el mismo número de páginas que utilizan Google, Yahoo y MSN para sus motores de búsqueda. Debido a que PageRank es un algoritmo basado en gráficos, es importante que se ejecute en un subconjunto lo más grande posible de la web. La mayoría de los estudios anteriores en PageRank utilizaron subconjuntos de la web que son significativamente más pequeños (por ejemplo, el corpus TREC VLC2, utilizado por muchos, contiene solo 19 millones de páginas) Calculamos PageRank usando el valor estándar de 0.85 para α. Popularidad Otra característica que utilizamos es la popularidad real de una página web, medida como la cantidad de veces que los usuarios lo han visitado durante algún período de tiempo. Tenemos acceso a dichos datos de usuarios que han instalado la barra de herramientas de MSN y han optado por proporcionarlos a MSN. Los datos se agregan en un recuento, para cada página web, del número de usuarios que vieron esa página. Aunque los datos de popularidad generalmente no están disponibles, hay otras dos fuentes para ello. El primero es de los registros proxy. Por ejemplo, una universidad que requiere que sus estudiantes usen un poder tienen un registro de todas las páginas que han visitado mientras están en el campus. Desafortunadamente, los datos proxy son bastante sesgados y relativamente pequeños. Otra fuente, internos para los motores de búsqueda, son los registros de los cuales los resultados de sus usuarios hicieron clic. Dichos datos fueron utilizados por el golpe directo del motor de búsqueda, y recientemente se ha explorado para fines de clasificación dinámica [20]. Una ventaja de los datos de la barra de herramientas sobre esto es que contiene información sobre visitas de URL que no son solo el resultado de una búsqueda. La popularidad en bruto se procesa en una serie de características, como la cantidad de veces que se vio una página y se vio el número de veces cualquier página en el dominio. Se proporcionan más detalles en la Sección 5.5. Texto de anclaje e insultos Estas características se basan en la información asociada con los enlaces a la página en cuestión. Incluye características como la cantidad total de texto en enlaces que apuntan a la página (texto de anclaje), el número de palabras únicas en ese texto, etc. Página Esta categoría consta de características que pueden determinarse mirando solo la página (y su URL). Utilizamos solo ocho características simples, como el número de palabras en el cuerpo, la frecuencia del término más común, etc. Dominio Esta categoría contiene características que se calculan como promedios en todas las páginas del dominio. Por ejemplo, el número promedio de ataques en cualquier página y el PageRank promedio. Muchas de estas características han sido utilizadas por otras para clasificar páginas web, particularmente las características de anclaje y página. Como se mencionó, la evaluación es típicamente para la clasificación dinámica, y deseamos evaluar el uso de ellos para la clasificación estática. Además, hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer estudio sobre el uso de la popularidad de las visitas de página real para la clasificación estática. El trabajo similar más cercano está en usar el comportamiento de clics (es decir, los resultados del motor de búsqueda en los que hacen los usuarios) para afectar la clasificación dinámica (ver, por ejemplo, [20]). Debido a que utilizamos una amplia variedad de características para encontrar una clasificación estática, nos referimos a esto como Frank (para la clasificación basada en características).Frank usa RankNet y el conjunto de características descritas en esta sección para aprender una función de clasificación para páginas web. A menos que se especifique lo contrario, Frank fue entrenado con todas las características.5. Experimentos En esta sección, demostraremos que podemos realizar PageRank aplicando el aprendizaje automático a un conjunto directo de características. Antes de los resultados, primero discutimos los datos, la métrica de rendimiento y el método de entrenamiento.5.1 Datos Para evaluar la calidad de una clasificación estática, necesitábamos un estándar de oro que define el orden correcto para un conjunto de páginas. Para esto, empleamos un conjunto de datos que contiene juicios humanos para 28000 consultas. Para cada consulta, a varios resultados se les asigna manualmente una calificación, de 0 a 4, por jueces humanos. La calificación está destinada a ser una medida de cuán relevante es el resultado para la consulta, donde 0 significa pobre y 4 significa excelente. Hay aproximadamente 500k juicios en total, o un promedio de 18 calificaciones por consulta. Las consultas se seleccionan eligiendo al azar consultas de entre las emitidas al motor de búsqueda MSN. La probabilidad de que se seleccione una consulta es proporcional a su frecuencia entre los 709 de las consultas. Como resultado, es más probable que consultas comunes sean juzgadas que consultas poco comunes. Como ejemplo de cuán diversas son las consultas, las primeras cuatro consultas en el set de entrenamiento son las escuelas de chefs, Chicagoland Speedway, Eagles Fan Club y la cultura turca. Los documentos seleccionados para juzgar son aquellos que esperábamos, en promedio, serían razonablemente relevantes (por ejemplo, los diez principales documentos devueltos por MSNS Search Engine). Esto proporciona significativamente más información que seleccionar aleatoriamente documentos en la web, la gran mayoría de los cuales sería irrelevante para una consulta dada. Debido a este proceso, las páginas juzgadas tienden a ser de mayor calidad que la página promedio en la web, y tienden a ser páginas que se devolverán para consultas de búsqueda comunes. Este sesgo es bueno al evaluar la calidad de la clasificación estática a los efectos del orden de índice y devolver documentos relevantes. Esto se debe a que la parte más importante del índice a estar bien ordenada y relevante es la parte que se devuelve con frecuencia para consultas de búsqueda. Debido a este sesgo, sin embargo, los resultados en este documento no son aplicables a la priorización de rastreo. Para obtener resultados experimentales sobre la priorización de rastreo, necesitaríamos calificaciones en una muestra aleatoria de páginas web. Para convertir los datos de la consulta dependiente de consulta independiente, simplemente eliminamos la consulta, tomando el máximo sobre los juicios para una URL que aparece en más de una consulta. El razonamiento detrás de esto es que una página que es relevante para alguna consulta e irrelevante para otra es probablemente una página decente y debería tener un alto rango estático. Debido a que evaluamos las páginas en consultas que ocurren con frecuencia, nuestros datos indican el orden de índice correcto y asigna un alto valor a las páginas que probablemente sean relevantes para una consulta común. Asignamos consultas al azar a un conjunto de capacitación, validación o prueba, de modo que contenían 84%, 8%y 8%de las consultas, respectivamente. Cada conjunto contiene todas las clasificaciones para una consulta dada, y no aparece ninguna consulta en más de un conjunto. El set de entrenamiento se utilizó para entrenar a Frank. El conjunto de validación se utilizó para seleccionar el modelo que tuviera el rendimiento más alto. El conjunto de pruebas se usó para los resultados finales. Estos datos nos proporcionan un pedido de páginas independiente de la consulta. El objetivo para un algoritmo de clasificación estática será reproducir este orden lo más cerca posible. En la siguiente sección, describimos la medida que utilizamos para evaluar esto.5.2 Medida Elegimos usar la precisión por pares para evaluar la calidad de una clasificación estática. La precisión por pares es la fracción del tiempo que el algoritmo de clasificación y los jueces humanos acuerdan el orden de un par de páginas web. Si S (x) es la clasificación estática asignada a la página X, y H (x) es el juicio humano de relevancia para x, entonces considere los siguientes conjuntos:)} () (:, {yhxhyx> = ph y)} () (:, {ysxsyx> = ps La precisión por pares es la porción de HP que también está contenida en SP: P PP H SH ∩ = AccuracyPairwise Esta medida se eligió por dos razones. Primero, los juicios humanos discretos proporcionan solo un pedido parcial en las páginas web, lo que dificulta aplicar una medida como el coeficiente de correlación de orden de rango de Spearman (en la medida de precisión por pares, un par de documentos con el mismo juicio humano no afecta elpuntaje). En segundo lugar, la precisión por pares tiene un significado intuitivo: es la fracción de pares de documentos que, cuando los humanos afirman que uno es mejor que el otro, el algoritmo de rango estático los ordena correctamente.5.3 Método Entrenamos a Frank (una red neuronal basada en RankNet) utilizando los siguientes parámetros. Utilizamos una red de 2 capas totalmente conectada. La capa oculta tenía 10 nodos ocultos. Los pesos de entrada a esta capa se inicializaron para ser cero. La capa de salida (solo un nodo solo) se inicializaron utilizando una distribución aleatoria uniforme en el rango [-0.1, 0.1]. Utilizamos Tanh como la función de transferencia de las entradas a la capa oculta, y una función lineal desde la capa oculta a la salida. La función de costo es la función de costo de entropía cruzada por pares como se discutió en la Sección 3. Las características en el conjunto de entrenamiento se normalizaron para tener media media y desviación estándar de la unidad. Luego se aplicó la misma transformación lineal a las características en los conjuntos de validación y prueba. Para el entrenamiento, presentamos a la red 5 millones de emparejamientos de páginas, donde una página tenía una calificación más alta que la otra. Los emparejamientos se eligieron uniformemente al azar (con reemplazo) de todos los emparejamientos posibles. Al formar los pares, ignoramos la magnitud de la diferencia entre las clasificaciones (la propagación de calificación) para las dos URL. Por lo tanto, el peso para cada par era constante (uno), y la probabilidad de que se seleccionara un par era independiente de su propagación de calificación. Entrenamos la red para 30 épocas. En cada época, los pares de entrenamiento se barajaban al azar. La tasa de entrenamiento inicial fue de 0.001. En cada época, verificamos el error en el conjunto de entrenamiento. Si el error había aumentado, entonces disminuimos la tasa de entrenamiento, bajo la hipótesis de que la red probablemente había superado. La tasa de entrenamiento en cada época se estableció para: tasa de entrenamiento = 1+ε κ donde κ es la tasa inicial (0.001), y ε es el número de veces que el error del conjunto de entrenamiento ha aumentado. Después de cada época, medimos el rendimiento de la red neuronal en el conjunto de validación, utilizando 1 millón de pares (elegidos al azar con reemplazo). Se seleccionó la red con la mayor precisión por pares en el conjunto de validación y luego se probó en el conjunto de pruebas. Reportamos la precisión por pares en el conjunto de pruebas, calculada utilizando todos los pares posibles. Estos parámetros se determinaron y fijaron antes de los experimentos de rango estático en este documento. En particular, la elección de la tasa de entrenamiento inicial, el número de épocas y la función de desintegración de la tasa de entrenamiento se tomaron directamente de Burges et al [7]. Aunque teníamos la opción de preprocesar cualquiera de las características antes de que fueran ingresadas a la red neuronal, nos abstuvimos de hacerlo en la mayoría de ellas. La única excepción fueron las características de popularidad. Como con la mayoría del fenómeno web, encontramos que la distribución de la popularidad del sitio es Zipfian. Para reducir el rango dinámico y, con suerte, hacer que la característica sea más útil, presentamos la red tanto sin practicos como el logaritmo de las características de popularidad (como con las demás, los valores de características logarítmicas también se normalizaron para tener cero mediay desviación estándar de la unidad).710 Aplicar Frank a un documento es computacionalmente eficiente, tomando un tiempo que solo es lineal en el número de características de entrada;Por lo tanto, se encuentra dentro de un factor constante de otros métodos simples de aprendizaje automático, como Bayes ingenuos. En nuestros experimentos, calcular el Frank para las cinco mil millones de páginas web fue aproximadamente 100 veces más rápido que calcular el PageRank para el mismo conjunto.5.4 Resultados Como muestra la Tabla 1, Frank supera significativamente a PageRank a los efectos de la clasificación estática. Con una precisión por pares de 67.4%, Frank duplica más que la precisión de PageRank (en relación con la línea de base del 50%, que es la precisión que se lograría mediante un orden aleatorio de páginas web). Tenga en cuenta que una de las características de entrada de Franks es el PageRank de la página, por lo que esperaríamos que no funcione peor que PageRank. El aumento significativo en la precisión implica que las otras características (ancla, popularidad, etc.) de hecho contienen información útil sobre la calidad general de una página. Tabla 1: Precisión de la técnica de resultados básicos (%) Ninguno (línea de base) 50.00 PageRank 56.70 Frank 67.43 Hay una serie de decisiones que van al cálculo de PageRank, como cómo lidiar con páginas que no tienen extractores, la elección de α, la elección de α,Precisión numérica, umbral de convergencia, etc. Pudimos obtener un cálculo de PageRank de una implementación completamente independiente (proporcionada por Marc Najork) que varió un poco en estos parámetros. Logró una precisión por pares de 56.52%, casi idéntica a la obtenida por nuestra implementación. Por lo tanto, concluimos que la calidad del PageRank no es sensible a estas variaciones menores en el algoritmo, ni PageRanks tenía baja precisión debido a problemas con nuestra implementación de la misma. También queríamos encontrar qué tan bien realizado cada conjunto de características. Para responder esto, para cada conjunto de características, entrenamos y probamos a Frank usando solo ese conjunto de características. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 2. Como se puede ver, cada característica establece un PageRank superado individualmente en esta prueba. Quizás el resultado más interesante es que las características de nivel de página tuvieron el rendimiento más alto de todos los conjuntos de características. Esto es sorprendente porque estas son características que no dependen de la estructura gráfica general de la web, ni siquiera de lo que las páginas apuntan a una página determinada. Esto es contrario a la creencia común de que la estructura del gráfico web es la clave para encontrar una buena clasificación estática de páginas web. Tabla 2: Resultados para conjuntos de características individuales. Precisión del conjunto de características (%) PageRank 56.70 Popularidad 60.82 Anchor 59.09 Página 63.93 Dominio 59.03 Todas las características 67.43 porque estamos utilizando una red neuronal de dos capas, las características en la red aprendida pueden interactuar entre sí de manera interesante y no lineal. Esto significa que una característica particular que parece tener poco valor de forma aislada podría ser muy importante cuando se usa en combinación con otras características. Para medir la contribución final de un conjunto de características, en el contexto de todas las otras características, realizamos un estudio de ablación. Es decir, para cada conjunto de características, entrenamos una red para contener todas las características, excepto ese conjunto. Luego comparamos el rendimiento de la red resultante con el rendimiento de la red con todas las características. La Tabla 3 muestra los resultados de este experimento, donde la disminución de la precisión es la diferencia en la precisión por pares entre la red entrenada con todas las características, y la red falta el conjunto de características dado. Tabla 3: Estudio de ablación. Se muestra la disminución de la precisión cuando entrenamos una red que tiene todas las características, excepto el conjunto dado. La última línea muestra el efecto de eliminar las características de ancla, PageRank y dominio, de ahí que un modelo no contiene información basada en red o enlace. La disminución del conjunto de características en la precisión PageRank 0.18 Popularidad 0.78 Anchor 0.47 Page 5.42 Ancla de dominio, PageRank y Domain 0.10 0.60 Los resultados del estudio de ablación son consistentes con el estudio de conjunto de características individuales. Ambos muestran que el conjunto de características más importante es el conjunto de características a nivel de página, y el segundo más importante es el conjunto de funciones de popularidad. Finalmente, deseamos ver cómo mejoró el rendimiento de Frank mientras agregamos características;Queríamos encontrar en qué punto agregar más conjuntos de características se volvió relativamente inútil. Comenzando sin características, agregamos con avidez el conjunto de características que más mejoró el rendimiento. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 4. Por ejemplo, la cuarta línea de la tabla muestra que Frank usa la página, la popularidad y las características de anclaje superaron a cualquier red que usara la página, la popularidad y algunos otros conjuntos de características, y que el rendimiento de esta red fue del 67.25%. Tabla 4: Se agregan el rendimiento de Frank como conjuntos de características. En cada fila, el conjunto de características que dio el mayor aumento en la precisión se agregó a la lista de características (es decir, realizamos una búsqueda codiciosa sobre conjuntos de características). Precisión del conjunto de características (%) Ninguno 50.00 +Página 63.93 +Popularidad 66.83 +Anchor 67.25 +PageRank 67.31 +Dominio 67.43 711 Finalmente, presentamos una comparación cualitativa de PageRank vs. Frank. En la Tabla 5 están las diez URL principales que regresaron para PageRank y para Frank. Los resultados de PageRanks están muy ponderados hacia los sitios de tecnología. Contiene dos URL rápidas (software de reproducción de video de manzanas), así como las URL de Internet Explorer y Firefox (las cuales son navegadores web).Frank, por otro lado, contiene sitios más orientados al consumidor como American Express, Target, Dell, etc. El sesgo de PageRanks hacia la tecnología puede explicarse a través de dos procesos. Primero, hay muchas páginas con botones en la parte inferior que sugieren que el sitio está optimizado para Internet Explorer, o que el visitante necesita QuickTime. Estos generalmente se vinculan con, en estos ejemplos, los sitios de descarga de Internet Explorer y QuickTime. En consecuencia, PageRank clasifica esas páginas altamente. Aunque estas páginas son importantes, no son tan importantes como pueden parecer al observar la estructura del enlace sola. Una solución para esto es agregar información sobre el enlace al cálculo de PageRank, como el tamaño del texto, ya sea en la parte inferior de la página, etc. El otro sesgo proviene del hecho de que la población de autores del sitio web es diferente a la población de usuarios web. Los autores web tienden a estar orientados tecnológicamente y, por lo tanto, su comportamiento de vinculación refleja esos intereses.Frank, al conocer la popularidad de las visitas real de un sitio (el conjunto de características de popularidad), puede eliminar parte de ese sesgo. Tiene la capacidad de depender más de dónde visiten los usuarios web reales en lugar de dónde se han vinculado los autores del sitio web. Los resultados confirman que Frank supera a PageRank con precisión por pares. Los dos conjuntos de características más importantes son la página y las características de popularidad. Esto es sorprendente, ya que las características de la página consistieron solo en algunas (8) características simples. Otros experimentos encontraron que, de las características de la página, las basadas en el texto de la página (a diferencia de la URL) tuvieron el mejor rendimiento. En la siguiente sección, exploramos la función de popularidad con más detalle.5.5 Datos de popularidad Como se menciona en la Sección 4, nuestros datos de popularidad provienen de los usuarios de la barra de herramientas de MSN. Por razones de privacidad, solo tuvimos acceso a un recuento agregado de, para cada URL, cuántas veces fue visitado por cualquier usuario de la barra de herramientas. Esto limitó las posibles características que podríamos derivar de estos datos. Para posibles extensiones, consulte la Sección 6.3, trabajo futuro. Para cada URL en nuestro tren y conjuntos de pruebas, le proporcionamos una característica a Frank, que era cuántas veces había sido visitado por un usuario de la barra de herramientas. Sin embargo, esta característica era bastante ruidosa y escasa, particularmente para las URL con parámetros de consulta (por ejemplo, http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=machine+learning&form=qbhp). Una solución fue proporcionar una característica adicional que era el número de veces que un usuario de la barra de herramientas visitó cualquier URL en el dominio dado. Agregar esta característica mejoró drásticamente el rendimiento de Frank. Llevamos este paso más y utilizamos la estructura jerárquica incorporada de las URL para construir muchos niveles de retroceso entre la URL completa y el dominio. Hicimos esto utilizando el conjunto de características que se muestran en la Tabla 6. Tabla 6: Funciones de URL utilizadas para calcular el conjunto de características de popularidad. Ejemplo de función exacto URL cnn.com/2005/tech/wikipedia.html?v=mobile Sin parámetros cnn.com/2005/tech/wikipedia.html Página wikipedia.html url-1 cnn.com/2005/tech URL-2 CNN.com/2005 ... Dominio CNN.com Dominio+1 CNN.com/2005 ... A cada URL se le asignó una característica para cada función que se muestra en la tabla. El valor de la característica fue el recuento de la cantidad de veces que un usuario de la barra de herramientas visitó una URL, donde la función aplicada a esa URL coincide con la función aplicada a la URL en cuestión. Por ejemplo, una visita a los usuarios a CNN.com/2005/sports.html incrementaría el dominio y el dominio+1 características para la URL cnn.com/2005/tech/wikipedia.html. Como se ve en la Tabla 7, agregar los recuentos de dominios mejoró significativamente la calidad de la función de popularidad, y agregar las numerosas funciones de retroceso enumeradas en la Tabla 6 mejoró aún más la precisión. Tabla 7: Efecto de agregar retroceso al conjunto de características de popularidad Precisión de precisión (%) URL Count 58.15 URL y recuento de dominio 59.31 Todas las funciones de retroceso (Tabla 6) 60.82 Tabla 5: Diez URL principales para PageRank vs. Frank Pagerank Frank Google.com Google.com Apple.com/quicktime/download yahoo.com amazon.com americanExpress.com Yahoo.com hp.com Microsoft.com/windows/ie Target.com Apple.com/quicktime bestbuy.com mapquest.com Dell.com ebay.COM AutoTrader.com mozilla.org/products/firefox dogpile.com ftc.gov bankofamerica.com 712 El respaldo a los subconjuntos de la URL es una técnica para tratar la escasez de datos. También es informativo ver cómo el rendimiento de Frank depende de la cantidad de datos de popularidad que hemos recopilado. En la Figura 1 mostramos el rendimiento de Frank entrenado con solo el conjunto de características de popularidad frente a la cantidad de datos que tenemos para el conjunto de características de popularidad. Cada día, recibimos datos de popularidad adicionales, y como se puede ver en la trama, esto aumenta el rendimiento de Frank. La relación es logarítmica: duplicar la cantidad de datos de popularidad proporciona una mejora constante en la precisión por pares. En resumen, hemos descubierto que las características de popularidad proporcionan un impulso útil para la precisión general de Frank. Recopilar más datos de popularidad, así como emplear estrategias simples de retroceso, mejorar este impulso aún más.5.6 Resumen de resultados Los experimentos proporcionan una serie de conclusiones. Primero, Frank funciona significativamente mejor que PageRank, incluso sin ninguna información sobre el gráfico web. En segundo lugar, el nivel de página y las características de popularidad fueron los contribuyentes más importantes para la precisión por pares. Tercero, al recopilar más datos de popularidad, podemos continuar mejorando el rendimiento de los francos. Los datos de popularidad proporcionan dos beneficios a Frank. Primero, vemos que cualitativamente, Franks Ordening of Web Pages tiene un sesgo más favorable que PageRanks.El pedido de Franks parece corresponder a lo que prefieren los usuarios de la web, en lugar de los autores de la página web. En segundo lugar, los datos de popularidad son más oportunos que la información del enlace de PageRanks. La barra de herramientas proporciona información sobre las páginas web que las personas encuentran interesantes en este momento, mientras que los enlaces se agregan a las páginas más lentamente, ya que los autores encuentran el tiempo y el interés.6. Trabajo relacionado y futuro 6.1 mejoras para PageRank Desde el artículo original de PageRank, ha habido trabajo para mejorarlo. Gran parte de ese trabajo se centra en acelerar y paralelarse el cálculo [15] [25]. Un problema reconocido con PageRank es el de la deriva del tema: una página sobre perros tendrá un alto PageRank si está vinculada por muchas páginas que tienen alto rango, independientemente de su tema. Por el contrario, un usuario de un motor de búsqueda que busca buenas páginas sobre perros probablemente preferiría encontrar páginas que sean apuntadas por muchas páginas que sean sobre perros. Por lo tanto, un enlace que está en el tema debería tener un mayor peso que un enlace que no lo es. Richardson y Domingoss Consulta PageRank [29] y el PageRank sensible al tema de Haveliwalas [16] son dos enfoques que abordan este problema. Otras variaciones para PageRank incluyen enlaces de ponderación de manera diferente para enlaces intervs. intra dominio, agregar un paso hacia atrás al surfista aleatorio para simular el botón de retroceso en la mayoría de los navegadores [24] y modificar la probabilidad de salto (α) [3]. Vea Langville y Meyer [23] para una buena encuesta de estos y otras modificaciones a PageRank.6.2 Otro trabajo relacionado PageRank no es el único algoritmo de análisis de enlaces utilizado para clasificar las páginas web. El otro más conocido son los éxitos [22], que utilizan el motor de búsqueda de Teoma [30]. Hits produce una lista de centros y autoridades, donde los centros son páginas que apuntan a muchas páginas de autoridad, y las autoridades son páginas que muchos centros apuntan. El trabajo anterior ha mostrado éxitos para realizar comparablemente a PageRank [1]. Un campo de interés es el de la poda del índice estático (ver, por ejemplo, Carmel et al. [8]). Los métodos de poda del índice estático reducen el tamaño del índice de motores de búsqueda mediante la eliminación de documentos que es poco probable que se devuelvan por una consulta de búsqueda. La poda generalmente se realiza en función de la frecuencia de los términos de consulta. Del mismo modo, Pandey y Olston [28] sugieren páginas rastreando con frecuencia si es probable que aparezcan incorrectamente (o no aparezcan) como resultado de una búsqueda. Se podrían incorporar métodos similares al rango estático (por ejemplo, cuántas consultas frecuentes contienen palabras que se encuentran en esta página). Otros han investigado el efecto que PageRank tiene en la web en general [9]. Argumentan que las páginas con PageRank alta tienen más probabilidades de encontrar los usuarios de la web, por lo que es más probable que se vinculen y, por lo tanto, es más probable que mantengan un PageRank más alto que otras páginas. Lo mismo puede ocurrir para los datos de popularidad. Si aumentamos la clasificación de páginas populares, es más probable que se hagan clic, aumentando aún más su popularidad. Cho et al.[10] argumentan que una medida más apropiada de la calidad de la página web dependería no solo de la estructura de enlace actual de la web, sino también del cambio en esa estructura de enlace. La misma técnica puede ser aplicable a los datos de popularidad: el cambio en la popularidad de una página puede ser más informativo que la popularidad absoluta. Un trabajo relacionado interesante es el de Ivory y Hearst [19]. Su objetivo era construir un modelo de sitios web que se consideren de alta calidad desde la perspectiva del contenido, la estructura y la navegación, el diseño visual, la funcionalidad, la interactividad y la experiencia general. Utilizaron más de 100 características de nivel de página, así como características que abarcan el rendimiento y la estructura del sitio. Esto les permite describir cualitativamente las cualidades de una página que lo hacen parecer atractivo (por ejemplo, el uso raro de la cursiva, al menos 9 puntos, ...) y (en el trabajo posterior) para construir un sistema que ayuda a los autores novedosos de la página web a crearPáginas de calidad evaluándolo de acuerdo con estas características. Las principales diferencias entre este trabajo y la nuestra son el objetivo (descubrir lo que constituye una buena página web versus páginas web de pedido a los efectos de la búsqueda web), el tamaño del estudio (utilizaron un conjunto de datos de menos de 6000 páginas versus nuestrasConjunto de 468,000), y nuestra comparación con PageRank.y = 0.577ln (x) + 58.283 r 2 = 0.9822 58 58.5 59 59.5 60 60.5 61 1 10 100 Días de la barra de herramientas Datos de pareja de parejas Figura 1: Relación entre la cantidad de datos de popularidad y el rendimiento del conjunto de características de popularidad. Nota El eje X es una escala logarítmica.713 Sin embargo, su trabajo proporciona información a características estáticas útiles adicionales que podríamos incorporar a Frank en el futuro. El trabajo reciente para incorporar características novedosas en la clasificación dinámica incluye que por Joachims et al.[21], quienes investigan el uso de comentarios implícitos de los usuarios, en la forma en que se hacen clic en los resultados del motor de búsqueda. Craswell et al.[11] Presente un método para determinar la mejor transformación para aplicar a las características independientes de consulta (como las utilizadas en este documento) con el propósito de mejorar la clasificación dinámica. Otro trabajo, como Boyan et al.[4] y Bartell et al.[2] Aplique el aprendizaje automático para mejorar la relevancia general de un motor de búsqueda (es decir, la clasificación dinámica). No aplican sus técnicas al problema de la clasificación estática.6.3 Trabajo futuro Hay muchas formas en que nos gustaría extender este trabajo. Primero, Frank usa solo una pequeña cantidad de características. Creemos que podríamos lograr resultados aún más significativos con más características. En particular, la existencia, o falta de ella, de ciertas palabras podría resultar muy significativa (por ejemplo, en construcción probablemente significa una página de baja calidad). Otras características podrían incluir el número de imágenes en una página, tamaño de esas imágenes, número de elementos de diseño (tablas, divs y tramos), uso de hojas de estilo, conformes a los estándares W3C (como XHTML 1.0 Strict), color de fondo de unpágina, etc. Muchas páginas se generan dinámicamente, cuyo contenido puede depender de los parámetros en la URL, la hora del día, el usuario que visita el sitio u otras variables. Para tales páginas, puede ser útil aplicar las técnicas que se encuentran en [26] para formar una aproximación estática a los fines de extraer características. La gramática resultante que describe la página podría ser una fuente de características adicionales que describen la complejidad de la página, como cuántos nodos no terminales tienen, la profundidad del árbol de la gramática, etc. Frank permite especificar una confianza en cada uno.emparejamiento de documentos. En el futuro, experimentaremos con probabilidades que dependen de la diferencia en los juicios humanos entre los dos elementos de la pareja. Por ejemplo, un par de documentos en los que uno se clasificó 4 y el otro 0 debería tener una mayor confianza que un par de documentos con calificación 3 y 2. Los experimentos en este documento están sesgados hacia páginas que tienen una calidad más alta que el promedio. Además, Frank con todas las características solo se puede aplicar a las páginas que ya se han rastreado. Por lo tanto, Frank es principalmente útil para ordenar índices y mejorar la relevancia, no para dirigir el rastreo. También nos gustaría investigar un enfoque de aprendizaje automático para la priorización de rastreo. Puede ser que una combinación de métodos sea mejor: por ejemplo, usar PageRank para seleccionar los mejores 5 mil millones de 20 mil millones de páginas en la web, luego usar Frank para ordenar el índice y afectar la relevancia de búsqueda. Otra dirección interesante para la exploración es incorporar características franco y de nivel de página directamente en el cálculo de PageRank. Trabajar en el sesgo del vector de salto de PageRank [16] y la matriz de transición [29], han demostrado la viabilidad y las ventajas de dicho enfoque. Hay razones para creer que una aplicación directa de [29], utilizando el franco de una página para su relevancia, podría conducir a un rango estático general mejorado. Finalmente, los datos de popularidad se pueden usar de otras maneras interesantes. Los hábitos generales de navegación y búsqueda de usuarios web varían según la hora del día. La actividad en la mañana, el día y la tarde a menudo son bastante diferentes (por ejemplo, leer las noticias, resolver problemas y acceder al entretenimiento, respectivamente). Podemos obtener información sobre estas diferencias utilizando los datos de popularidad, divididos en segmentos del día. Cuando se emite una consulta, usaríamos los datos de popularidad que coinciden con el tiempo de consulta para hacer la clasificación de páginas web. También planeamos explorar características de popularidad que usan más que solo los recuentos de la frecuencia con la que se visitó una página. Por ejemplo, cuánto tiempo los usuarios tendieron a detenerse en una página, dejaron la página haciendo clic en un enlace o presionando el botón Atrás, etc. Fox et al.hizo un estudio que mostró que características como esta pueden ser valiosas para el propósito de la clasificación dinámica [14]. Finalmente, los datos de popularidad podrían usarse como etiqueta en lugar de una característica. El uso de Frank de esta manera para predecir la popularidad de una página puede ser útil para las tareas de relevancia, eficiencia y prioridad de rastreo. También hay datos significativamente más populares que los datos etiquetados por humanos, lo que potencialmente permite métodos de aprendizaje automático más complejos y significativamente más características.7. Conclusiones Una buena clasificación estática es un componente importante para los motores de búsqueda de hoy y los sistemas de recuperación de información. Hemos demostrado que PageRank no proporciona una muy buena clasificación estática;Hay muchas características simples que individualmente realizan PageRank. Al combinar muchas características estáticas, Frank logra una clasificación que tiene una precisión por pares significativamente más alta que PageRank solo. Una evaluación cualitativa de los principales documentos muestra que Frank es menos sesgada de tecnología que PageRank;Al usar datos de popularidad, está sesgado hacia páginas que los usuarios web, en lugar de los autores web, visitan. El componente de aprendizaje automático de Frank le brinda el beneficio adicional de ser más robusto contra los spammers, y le permite aprovechar más desarrollos en la comunidad de aprendizaje automático en áreas como la clasificación adversaria. Solo hemos comenzado a explorar las opciones y creemos que se pueden hacer avances significativos en el área de clasificación estática mediante experimentación adicional con características adicionales, otras técnicas de aprendizaje automático y fuentes adicionales de datos.8.

        "Beyond PageRank: Machine Learning for Static Ranking Matthew Richardson Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 +1 (425) 722-3325 mattri@microsoft.com Amit Prakash MSN One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 +1 (425) 705-6015 amitp@microsoft.com Eric Brill Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 +1 (425) 705-4992 brill@microsoft.com ABSTRACT Since the publication of Brin and Pages paper on PageRank, many in the Web community have depended on PageRank for the static (query-independent) ordering of Web pages.",
        "We show that we can significantly outperform PageRank using features that are independent of the link structure of the Web.",
        "We gain a further boost in accuracy by using data on the frequency at which users visit Web pages.",
        "We use RankNet, a ranking machine learning algorithm, to combine these and other static features based on anchor text and domain characteristics.",
        "The resulting model achieves a static ranking pairwise accuracy of 67.3% (vs. 56.7% for PageRank or 50% for random).",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.6 [Artificial Intelligence]: Learning.",
        "H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval.",
        "General Terms Algorithms, Measurement, Performance, Experimentation. 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Over the past decade, the Web has grown exponentially in size.",
        "Unfortunately, this growth has not been isolated to good-quality pages.",
        "The number of incorrect, spamming, and malicious (e.g., phishing) sites has also grown rapidly.",
        "The sheer number of both good and bad pages on the Web has led to an increasing reliance on search engines for the discovery of useful information.",
        "Users rely on search engines not only to return pages related to their search query, but also to separate the good from the bad, and order results so that the best pages are suggested first.",
        "To date, most work on Web page ranking has focused on improving the ordering of the results returned to the user (querydependent ranking, or dynamic ranking).",
        "However, having a good query-independent ranking (static ranking) is also crucially important for a search engine.",
        "A good static ranking algorithm provides numerous benefits: • Relevance: The static rank of a page provides a general indicator to the overall quality of the page.",
        "This is a useful input to the dynamic ranking algorithm. • Efficiency: Typically, the search engines index is ordered by static rank.",
        "By traversing the index from highquality to low-quality pages, the dynamic ranker may abort the search when it determines that no later page will have as high of a dynamic rank as those already found.",
        "The more accurate the static rank, the better this early-stopping ability, and hence the quicker the search engine may respond to queries. • Crawl Priority: The Web grows and changes as quickly as search engines can crawl it.",
        "Search engines need a way to prioritize their crawl-to determine which pages to recrawl, how frequently, and how often to seek out new pages.",
        "Among other factors, the static rank of a page is used to determine this prioritization.",
        "A better static rank thus provides the engine with a higher quality, more upto-date index.",
        "Google is often regarded as the first commercially successful search engine.",
        "Their ranking was originally based on the PageRank algorithm [5][27].",
        "Due to this (and possibly due to Googles promotion of PageRank to the public), PageRank is widely regarded as the best method for the static ranking of Web pages.",
        "Though PageRank has historically been thought to perform quite well, there has yet been little academic evidence to support this claim.",
        "Even worse, there has recently been work showing that PageRank may not perform any better than other simple measures on certain tasks.",
        "Upstill et al. have found that for the task of finding home pages, the number of pages linking to a page and the type of URL were as, or more, effective than PageRank [32].",
        "They found similar results for the task of finding high quality companies [31].",
        "PageRank has also been used in systems for TRECs very large collection and Web track competitions, but with much less success than had been expected [17].",
        "Finally, Amento et al. [1] found that simple features, such as the number of pages on a site, performed as well as PageRank.",
        "Despite these, the general belief remains among many, both academic and in the public, that PageRank is an essential factor for a good static rank.",
        "Failing this, it is still assumed that using the link structure is crucial, in the form of the number of inlinks or the amount of anchor text.",
        "In this paper, we show there are a number of simple url- or pagebased features that significantly outperform PageRank (for the purposes of statically ranking Web pages) despite ignoring the structure of the Web.",
        "We combine these and other static features using machine learning to achieve a ranking system that is significantly better than PageRank (in pairwise agreement with human labels).",
        "A machine learning approach for static ranking has other advantages besides the quality of the ranking.",
        "Because the measure consists of many features, it is harder for malicious users to manipulate it (i.e., to raise their pages static rank to an undeserved level through questionable techniques, also known as Web spamming).",
        "This is particularly true if the feature set is not known.",
        "In contrast, a single measure like PageRank can be easier to manipulate because spammers need only concentrate on one goal: how to cause more pages to point to their page.",
        "With an algorithm that learns, a feature that becomes unusable due to spammer manipulation will simply be reduced or removed from the final computation of rank.",
        "This flexibility allows a ranking system to rapidly react to new spamming techniques.",
        "A machine learning approach to static ranking is also able to take advantage of any advances in the machine learning field.",
        "For example, recent work on adversarial classification [12] suggests that it may be possible to explicitly model the Web page spammers (the adversary) actions, adjusting the ranking model in advance of the spammers attempts to circumvent it.",
        "Another example is the elimination of outliers in constructing the model, which helps reduce the effect that unique sites may have on the overall quality of the static rank.",
        "By moving static ranking to a machine learning framework, we not only gain in accuracy, but also gain in the ability to react to spammers actions, to rapidly add new features to the ranking algorithm, and to leverage advances in the rapidly growing field of machine learning.",
        "Finally, we believe there will be significant advantages to using this technique for other domains, such as searching a local hard drive or a corporations intranet.",
        "These are domains where the link structure is particularly weak (or non-existent), but there are other domain-specific features that could be just as powerful.",
        "For example, the author of an intranet page and his/her position in the organization (e.g., CEO, manager, or developer) could provide significant clues as to the importance of that page.",
        "A machine learning approach thus allows rapid development of a good static algorithm in new domains.",
        "This papers contribution is a systematic study of static features, including PageRank, for the purposes of (statically) ranking Web pages.",
        "Previous studies on PageRank typically used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g., the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages).",
        "Also, the performance of PageRank and other static features has typically been evaluated in the context of a complete system for dynamic ranking, or for other tasks such as question answering.",
        "In contrast, we explore the use of PageRank and other features for the direct task of statically ranking Web pages.",
        "We first briefly describe the PageRank algorithm.",
        "In Section 3 we introduce RankNet, the machine learning technique used to combine static features into a final ranking.",
        "Section 4 describes the static features.",
        "The heart of the paper is in Section 5, which presents our experiments and results.",
        "We conclude with a discussion of related and future work. 2.",
        "PAGERANK The basic idea behind PageRank is simple: a link from a Web page to another can be seen as an endorsement of that page.",
        "In general, links are made by people.",
        "As such, they are indicative of the quality of the pages to which they point - when creating a page, an author presumably chooses to link to pages deemed to be of good quality.",
        "We can take advantage of this linkage information to order Web pages according to their perceived quality.",
        "Imagine a Web surfer who jumps from Web page to Web page, choosing with uniform probability which link to follow at each step.",
        "In order to reduce the effect of dead-ends or endless cycles the surfer will occasionally jump to a random page with some small probability α, or when on a page with no out-links.",
        "If averaged over a sufficient number of steps, the probability the surfer is on page j at some point in time is given by the formula: ∑∈ + − = ji i iP N jP B F )()1( )( α α (1) Where Fi is the set of pages that page i links to, and Bj is the set of pages that link to page j.",
        "The PageRank score for node j is defined as this probability: PR(j)=P(j).",
        "Because equation (1) is recursive, it must be iteratively evaluated until P(j) converges (typically, the initial distribution for P(j) is uniform).",
        "The intuition is, because a random surfer would end up at the page more frequently, it is likely a better page.",
        "An alternative view for equation (1) is that each page is assigned a quality, P(j).",
        "A page gives an equal share of its quality to each page it points to.",
        "PageRank is computationally expensive.",
        "Our collection of 5 billion pages contains approximately 370 billion links.",
        "Computing PageRank requires iterating over these billions of links multiple times (until convergence).",
        "It requires large amounts of memory (or very smart caching schemes that slow the computation down even further), and if spread across multiple machines, requires significant communication between them.",
        "Though much work has been done on optimizing the PageRank computation (see e.g., [25] and [6]), it remains a relatively slow, computationally expensive property to compute. 3.",
        "RANKNET Much work in machine learning has been done on the problems of classification and regression.",
        "Let X={xi} be a collection of feature vectors (typically, a feature is any real valued number), and Y={yi} be a collection of associated classes, where yi is the class of the object described by feature vector xi.",
        "The classification problem is to learn a function f that maps yi=f(xi), for all i.",
        "When yi is real-valued as well, this is called regression.",
        "Static ranking can be seen as a regression problem.",
        "If we let xi represent features of page i, and yi be a value (say, the rank) for each page, we could learn a regression function that mapped each pages features to their rank.",
        "However, this over-constrains the problem we wish to solve.",
        "All we really care about is the order of the pages, not the actual value assigned to them.",
        "Recent work on this ranking problem [7][13][18] directly attempts to optimize the ordering of the objects, rather than the value assigned to them.",
        "For these, let Z={<i,j>} be a collection of pairs of items, where item i should be assigned a higher value than item j.",
        "The goal of the ranking problem, then, is to learn a function f such that, )()(,, ji ffji xxZ >∈∀ 708 Note that, as with learning a regression function, the result of this process is a function (f) that maps feature vectors to real values.",
        "This function can still be applied anywhere that a regressionlearned function could be applied.",
        "The only difference is the technique used to learn the function.",
        "By directly optimizing the ordering of objects, these methods are able to learn a function that does a better job of ranking than do regression techniques.",
        "We used RankNet [7], one of the aforementioned techniques for learning ranking functions, to learn our static rank function.",
        "RankNet is a straightforward modification to the standard neural network back-prop algorithm.",
        "As with back-prop, RankNet attempts to minimize the value of a cost function by adjusting each weight in the network according to the gradient of the cost function with respect to that weight.",
        "The difference is that, while a typical neural network cost function is based on the difference between the network output and the desired output, the RankNet cost function is based on the difference between a pair of network outputs.",
        "That is, for each pair of feature vectors <i,j> in the training set, RankNet computes the network outputs oi and oj.",
        "Since vector i is supposed to be ranked higher than vector j, the larger is oj-oi, the larger the cost.",
        "RankNet also allows the pairs in Z to be weighted with a confidence (posed as the probability that the pair satisfies the ordering induced by the ranking function).",
        "In this paper, we used a probability of one for all pairs.",
        "In the next section, we will discuss the features used in our feature vectors, xi. 4.",
        "FEATURES To apply RankNet (or other machine learning techniques) to the ranking problem, we needed to extract a set of features from each page.",
        "We divided our feature set into four, mutually exclusive, categories: page-level (Page), domain-level (Domain), anchor text and inlinks (Anchor), and popularity (Popularity).",
        "We also optionally used the PageRank of a page as a feature.",
        "Below, we describe each of these feature categories in more detail.",
        "PageRank We computed PageRank on a Web graph of 5 billion crawled pages (and 20 billion known URLs linked to by these pages).",
        "This represents a significant portion of the Web, and is approximately the same number of pages as are used by Google, Yahoo, and MSN for their search engines.",
        "Because PageRank is a graph-based algorithm, it is important that it be run on as large a subset of the Web as possible.",
        "Most previous studies on PageRank used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g. the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages) We computed PageRank using the standard value of 0.85 for α.",
        "Popularity Another feature we used is the actual popularity of a Web page, measured as the number of times that it has been visited by users over some period of time.",
        "We have access to such data from users who have installed the MSN toolbar and have opted to provide it to MSN.",
        "The data is aggregated into a count, for each Web page, of the number of users who viewed that page.",
        "Though popularity data is generally unavailable, there are two other sources for it.",
        "The first is from proxy logs.",
        "For example, a university that requires its students to use a proxy has a record of all the pages they have visited while on campus.",
        "Unfortunately, proxy data is quite biased and relatively small.",
        "Another source, internal to search engines, are records of which results their users clicked on.",
        "Such data was used by the search engine Direct Hit, and has recently been explored for dynamic ranking purposes [20].",
        "An advantage of the toolbar data over this is that it contains information about URL visits that are not just the result of a search.",
        "The raw popularity is processed into a number of features such as the number of times a page was viewed and the number of times any page in the domain was viewed.",
        "More details are provided in section 5.5.",
        "Anchor text and inlinks These features are based on the information associated with links to the page in question.",
        "It includes features such as the total amount of text in links pointing to the page (anchor text), the number of unique words in that text, etc.",
        "Page This category consists of features which may be determined by looking at the page (and its URL) alone.",
        "We used only eight, simple features such as the number of words in the body, the frequency of the most common term, etc.",
        "Domain This category contains features that are computed as averages across all pages in the domain.",
        "For example, the average number of outlinks on any page and the average PageRank.",
        "Many of these features have been used by others for ranking Web pages, particularly the anchor and page features.",
        "As mentioned, the evaluation is typically for dynamic ranking, and we wish to evaluate the use of them for static ranking.",
        "Also, to our knowledge, this is the first study on the use of actual page visitation popularity for static ranking.",
        "The closest similar work is on using click-through behavior (that is, which search engine results the users click on) to affect dynamic ranking (see e.g., [20]).",
        "Because we use a wide variety of features to come up with a static ranking, we refer to this as fRank (for feature-based ranking). fRank uses RankNet and the set of features described in this section to learn a ranking function for Web pages.",
        "Unless otherwise specified, fRank was trained with all of the features. 5.",
        "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we will demonstrate that we can out perform PageRank by applying machine learning to a straightforward set of features.",
        "Before the results, we first discuss the data, the performance metric, and the training method. 5.1 Data In order to evaluate the quality of a static ranking, we needed a gold standard defining the correct ordering for a set of pages.",
        "For this, we employed a dataset which contains human judgments for 28000 queries.",
        "For each query, a number of results are manually assigned a rating, from 0 to 4, by human judges.",
        "The rating is meant to be a measure of how relevant the result is for the query, where 0 means poor and 4 means excellent.",
        "There are approximately 500k judgments in all, or an average of 18 ratings per query.",
        "The queries are selected by randomly choosing queries from among those issued to the MSN search engine.",
        "The probability that a query is selected is proportional to its frequency among all 709 of the queries.",
        "As a result, common queries are more likely to be judged than uncommon queries.",
        "As an example of how diverse the queries are, the first four queries in the training set are chef schools, chicagoland speedway, eagles fan club, and Turkish culture.",
        "The documents selected for judging are those that we expected would, on average, be reasonably relevant (for example, the top ten documents returned by MSNs search engine).",
        "This provides significantly more information than randomly selecting documents on the Web, the vast majority of which would be irrelevant to a given query.",
        "Because of this process, the judged pages tend to be of higher quality than the average page on the Web, and tend to be pages that will be returned for common search queries.",
        "This bias is good when evaluating the quality of static ranking for the purposes of index ordering and returning relevant documents.",
        "This is because the most important portion of the index to be well-ordered and relevant is the portion that is frequently returned for search queries.",
        "Because of this bias, however, the results in this paper are not applicable to crawl prioritization.",
        "In order to obtain experimental results on crawl prioritization, we would need ratings on a random sample of Web pages.",
        "To convert the data from query-dependent to query-independent, we simply removed the query, taking the maximum over judgments for a URL that appears in more than one query.",
        "The reasoning behind this is that a page that is relevant for some query and irrelevant for another is probably a decent page and should have a high static rank.",
        "Because we evaluated the pages on queries that occur frequently, our data indicates the correct index ordering, and assigns high value to pages that are likely to be relevant to a common query.",
        "We randomly assigned queries to a training, validation, or test set, such that they contained 84%, 8%, and 8% of the queries, respectively.",
        "Each set contains all of the ratings for a given query, and no query appears in more than one set.",
        "The training set was used to train fRank.",
        "The validation set was used to select the model that had the highest performance.",
        "The test set was used for the final results.",
        "This data gives us a query-independent ordering of pages.",
        "The goal for a static ranking algorithm will be to reproduce this ordering as closely as possible.",
        "In the next section, we describe the measure we used to evaluate this. 5.2 Measure We chose to use pairwise accuracy to evaluate the quality of a static ranking.",
        "The pairwise accuracy is the fraction of time that the ranking algorithm and human judges agree on the ordering of a pair of Web pages.",
        "If S(x) is the static ranking assigned to page x, and H(x) is the human judgment of relevance for x, then consider the following sets: )}()(:,{ yHxHyx >=pH and )}()(:,{ ySxSyx >=pS The pairwise accuracy is the portion of Hp that is also contained in Sp: p pp H SH ∩ =accuracypairwise This measure was chosen for two reasons.",
        "First, the discrete human judgments provide only a partial ordering over Web pages, making it difficult to apply a measure such as the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (in the pairwise accuracy measure, a pair of documents with the same human judgment does not affect the score).",
        "Second, the pairwise accuracy has an intuitive meaning: it is the fraction of pairs of documents that, when the humans claim one is better than the other, the static rank algorithm orders them correctly. 5.3 Method We trained fRank (a RankNet based neural network) using the following parameters.",
        "We used a fully connected 2 layer network.",
        "The hidden layer had 10 hidden nodes.",
        "The input weights to this layer were all initialized to be zero.",
        "The output layer (just a single node) weights were initialized using a uniform random distribution in the range [-0.1, 0.1].",
        "We used tanh as the transfer function from the inputs to the hidden layer, and a linear function from the hidden layer to the output.",
        "The cost function is the pairwise cross entropy cost function as discussed in section 3.",
        "The features in the training set were normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.",
        "The same linear transformation was then applied to the features in the validation and test sets.",
        "For training, we presented the network with 5 million pairings of pages, where one page had a higher rating than the other.",
        "The pairings were chosen uniformly at random (with replacement) from all possible pairings.",
        "When forming the pairs, we ignored the magnitude of the difference between the ratings (the rating spread) for the two URLs.",
        "Hence, the weight for each pair was constant (one), and the probability of a pair being selected was independent of its rating spread.",
        "We trained the network for 30 epochs.",
        "On each epoch, the training pairs were randomly shuffled.",
        "The initial training rate was 0.001.",
        "At each epoch, we checked the error on the training set.",
        "If the error had increased, then we decreased the training rate, under the hypothesis that the network had probably overshot.",
        "The training rate at each epoch was thus set to: Training rate = 1+ε κ Where κ is the initial rate (0.001), and ε is the number of times the training set error has increased.",
        "After each epoch, we measured the performance of the neural network on the validation set, using 1 million pairs (chosen randomly with replacement).",
        "The network with the highest pairwise accuracy on the validation set was selected, and then tested on the test set.",
        "We report the pairwise accuracy on the test set, calculated using all possible pairs.",
        "These parameters were determined and fixed before the static rank experiments in this paper.",
        "In particular, the choice of initial training rate, number of epochs, and training rate decay function were taken directly from Burges et al [7].",
        "Though we had the option of preprocessing any of the features before they were input to the neural network, we refrained from doing so on most of them.",
        "The only exception was the popularity features.",
        "As with most Web phenomenon, we found that the distribution of site popularity is Zipfian.",
        "To reduce the dynamic range, and hopefully make the feature more useful, we presented the network with both the unpreprocessed, as well as the logarithm, of the popularity features (As with the others, the logarithmic feature values were also normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation). 710 Applying fRank to a document is computationally efficient, taking time that is only linear in the number of input features; it is thus within a constant factor of other simple machine learning methods such as naïve Bayes.",
        "In our experiments, computing the fRank for all five billion Web pages was approximately 100 times faster than computing the PageRank for the same set. 5.4 Results As Table 1 shows, fRank significantly outperforms PageRank for the purposes of static ranking.",
        "With a pairwise accuracy of 67.4%, fRank more than doubles the accuracy of PageRank (relative to the baseline of 50%, which is the accuracy that would be achieved by a random ordering of Web pages).",
        "Note that one of fRanks input features is the PageRank of the page, so we would expect it to perform no worse than PageRank.",
        "The significant increase in accuracy implies that the other features (anchor, popularity, etc.) do in fact contain useful information regarding the overall quality of a page.",
        "Table 1: Basic Results Technique Accuracy (%) None (Baseline) 50.00 PageRank 56.70 fRank 67.43 There are a number of decisions that go into the computation of PageRank, such as how to deal with pages that have no outlinks, the choice of α, numeric precision, convergence threshold, etc.",
        "We were able to obtain a computation of PageRank from a completely independent implementation (provided by Marc Najork) that varied somewhat in these parameters.",
        "It achieved a pairwise accuracy of 56.52%, nearly identical to that obtained by our implementation.",
        "We thus concluded that the quality of the PageRank is not sensitive to these minor variations in algorithm, nor was PageRanks low accuracy due to problems with our implementation of it.",
        "We also wanted to find how well each feature set performed.",
        "To answer this, for each feature set, we trained and tested fRank using only that set of features.",
        "The results are shown in Table 2.",
        "As can be seen, every single feature set individually outperformed PageRank on this test.",
        "Perhaps the most interesting result is that the Page-level features had the highest performance out of all the feature sets.",
        "This is surprising because these are features that do not depend on the overall graph structure of the Web, nor even on what pages point to a given page.",
        "This is contrary to the common belief that the Web graph structure is the key to finding a good static ranking of Web pages.",
        "Table 2: Results for individual feature sets.",
        "Feature Set Accuracy (%) PageRank 56.70 Popularity 60.82 Anchor 59.09 Page 63.93 Domain 59.03 All Features 67.43 Because we are using a two-layer neural network, the features in the learned network can interact with each other in interesting, nonlinear ways.",
        "This means that a particular feature that appears to have little value in isolation could actually be very important when used in combination with other features.",
        "To measure the final contribution of a feature set, in the context of all the other features, we performed an ablation study.",
        "That is, for each set of features, we trained a network to contain all of the features except that set.",
        "We then compared the performance of the resulting network to the performance of the network with all of the features.",
        "Table 3 shows the results of this experiment, where the decrease in accuracy is the difference in pairwise accuracy between the network trained with all of the features, and the network missing the given feature set.",

        "Shown is the decrease in accuracy when we train a network that has all but the given set of features.",

        "Feature Set Decrease in Accuracy PageRank 0.18 Popularity 0.78 Anchor 0.47 Page 5.42 Domain Anchor, PageRank & Domain 0.10 0.60 The results of the ablation study are consistent with the individual feature set study.",
        "Both show that the most important feature set is the Page-level feature set, and the second most important is the popularity feature set.",
        "Finally, we wished to see how the performance of fRank improved as we added features; we wanted to find at what point adding more feature sets became relatively useless.",
        "Beginning with no features, we greedily added the feature set that improved performance the most.",
        "The results are shown in Table 4.",
        "For example, the fourth line of the table shows that fRank using the page, popularity, and anchor features outperformed any network that used the page, popularity, and some other feature set, and that the performance of this network was 67.25%.",

        "In Table 5 are the top ten URLs returned for PageRank and for fRank.",
        "PageRanks results are heavily weighted towards technology sites.",
        "It contains two QuickTime URLs (Apples video playback software), as well as Internet Explorer and FireFox URLs (both of which are Web browsers). fRank, on the other hand, contains more consumer-oriented sites such as American Express, Target, Dell, etc.",
        "PageRanks bias toward technology can be explained through two processes.",
        "First, there are many pages with buttons at the bottom suggesting that the site is optimized for Internet Explorer, or that the visitor needs QuickTime.",
        "These generally link back to, in these examples, the Internet Explorer and QuickTime download sites.",
        "Consequently, PageRank ranks those pages highly.",
        "Though these pages are important, they are not as important as it may seem by looking at the link structure alone.",
        "One fix for this is to add information about the link to the PageRank computation, such as the size of the text, whether it was at the bottom of the page, etc.",
        "The other bias comes from the fact that the population of Web site authors is different than the population of Web users.",
        "Web authors tend to be technologically-oriented, and thus their linking behavior reflects those interests. fRank, by knowing the actual visitation popularity of a site (the popularity feature set), is able to eliminate some of that bias.",
        "It has the ability to depend more on where actual Web users visit rather than where the Web site authors have linked.",
        "The results confirm that fRank outperforms PageRank in pairwise accuracy.",
        "The two most important feature sets are the page and popularity features.",
        "This is surprising, as the page features consisted only of a few (8) simple features.",
        "Further experiments found that, of the page features, those based on the text of the page (as opposed to the URL) performed the best.",
        "In the next section, we explore the popularity feature in more detail. 5.5 Popularity Data As mentioned in section 4, our popularity data came from MSN toolbar users.",
        "For privacy reasons, we had access only to an aggregate count of, for each URL, how many times it was visited by any toolbar user.",
        "This limited the possible features we could derive from this data.",
        "For possible extensions, see section 6.3, future work.",
        "For each URL in our train and test sets, we provided a feature to fRank which was how many times it had been visited by a toolbar user.",
        "However, this feature was quite noisy and sparse, particularly for URLs with query parameters (e.g., http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=machine+learning&form=QBHP).",
        "One solution was to provide an additional feature which was the number of times any URL at the given domain was visited by a toolbar user.",
        "Adding this feature dramatically improved the performance of fRank.",
        "We took this one step further and used the built-in hierarchical structure of URLs to construct many levels of backoff between the full URL and the domain.",
        "We did this by using the set of features shown in Table 6.",
        "Table 6: URL functions used to compute the Popularity feature set.",
        "Function Example Exact URL cnn.com/2005/tech/wikipedia.html?v=mobile No Params cnn.com/2005/tech/wikipedia.html Page wikipedia.html URL-1 cnn.com/2005/tech URL-2 cnn.com/2005 … Domain cnn.com Domain+1 cnn.com/2005 … Each URL was assigned one feature for each function shown in the table.",
        "The value of the feature was the count of the number of times a toolbar user visited a URL, where the function applied to that URL matches the function applied to the URL in question.",
        "For example, a users visit to cnn.com/2005/sports.html would increment the Domain and Domain+1 features for the URL cnn.com/2005/tech/wikipedia.html.",
        "As seen in Table 7, adding the domain counts significantly improved the quality of the popularity feature, and adding the numerous backoff functions listed in Table 6 improved the accuracy even further.",
        "Table 7: Effect of adding backoff to the popularity feature set Features Accuracy (%) URL count 58.15 URL and Domain counts 59.31 All backoff functions (Table 6) 60.82 Table 5: Top ten URLs for PageRank vs. fRank PageRank fRank google.com google.com apple.com/quicktime/download yahoo.com amazon.com americanexpress.com yahoo.com hp.com microsoft.com/windows/ie target.com apple.com/quicktime bestbuy.com mapquest.com dell.com ebay.com autotrader.com mozilla.org/products/firefox dogpile.com ftc.gov bankofamerica.com 712 Backing off to subsets of the URL is one technique for dealing with the sparsity of data.",
        "It is also informative to see how the performance of fRank depends on the amount of popularity data that we have collected.",
        "In Figure 1 we show the performance of fRank trained with only the popularity feature set vs. the amount of data we have for the popularity feature set.",
        "Each day, we receive additional popularity data, and as can be seen in the plot, this increases the performance of fRank.",
        "The relation is logarithmic: doubling the amount of popularity data provides a constant improvement in pairwise accuracy.",
        "In summary, we have found that the popularity features provide a useful boost to the overall fRank accuracy.",
        "Gathering more popularity data, as well as employing simple backoff strategies, improve this boost even further. 5.6 Summary of Results The experiments provide a number of conclusions.",
        "First, fRank performs significantly better than PageRank, even without any information about the Web graph.",
        "Second, the page level and popularity features were the most significant contributors to pairwise accuracy.",
        "Third, by collecting more popularity data, we can continue to improve fRanks performance.",
        "The popularity data provides two benefits to fRank.",
        "First, we see that qualitatively, fRanks ordering of Web pages has a more favorable bias than PageRanks. fRanks ordering seems to correspond to what Web users, rather than Web page authors, prefer.",
        "Second, the popularity data is more timely than PageRanks link information.",
        "The toolbar provides information about which Web pages people find interesting right now, whereas links are added to pages more slowly, as authors find the time and interest. 6.",
        "RELATED AND FUTURE WORK 6.1 Improvements to PageRank Since the original PageRank paper, there has been work on improving it.",
        "Much of that work centers on speeding up and parallelizing the computation [15][25].",
        "One recognized problem with PageRank is that of topic drift: A page about dogs will have high PageRank if it is linked to by many pages that themselves have high rank, regardless of their topic.",
        "In contrast, a search engine user looking for good pages about dogs would likely prefer to find pages that are pointed to by many pages that are themselves about dogs.",
        "Hence, a link that is on topic should have higher weight than a link that is not.",
        "Richardson and Domingoss Query Dependent PageRank [29] and Haveliwalas Topic-Sensitive PageRank [16] are two approaches that tackle this problem.",
        "Other variations to PageRank include differently weighting links for inter- vs. intra-domain links, adding a backwards step to the random surfer to simulate the back button on most browsers [24] and modifying the jump probability (α) [3].",
        "See Langville and Meyer [23] for a good survey of these, and other modifications to PageRank. 6.2 Other related work PageRank is not the only link analysis algorithm used for ranking Web pages.",
        "The most well-known other is HITS [22], which is used by the Teoma search engine [30].",
        "HITS produces a list of hubs and authorities, where hubs are pages that point to many authority pages, and authorities are pages that are pointed to by many hubs.",
        "Previous work has shown HITS to perform comparably to PageRank [1].",
        "One field of interest is that of static index pruning (see e.g., Carmel et al. [8]).",
        "Static index pruning methods reduce the size of the search engines index by removing documents that are unlikely to be returned by a search query.",
        "The pruning is typically done based on the frequency of query terms.",
        "Similarly, Pandey and Olston [28] suggest crawling pages frequently if they are likely to incorrectly appear (or not appear) as a result of a search.",
        "Similar methods could be incorporated into the static rank (e.g., how many frequent queries contain words found on this page).",
        "Others have investigated the effect that PageRank has on the Web at large [9].",
        "They argue that pages with high PageRank are more likely to be found by Web users, thus more likely to be linked to, and thus more likely to maintain a higher PageRank than other pages.",
        "The same may occur for the popularity data.",
        "If we increase the ranking for popular pages, they are more likely to be clicked on, thus further increasing their popularity.",
        "Cho et al. [10] argue that a more appropriate measure of Web page quality would depend on not only the current link structure of the Web, but also on the change in that link structure.",
        "The same technique may be applicable to popularity data: the change in popularity of a page may be more informative than the absolute popularity.",
        "One interesting related work is that of Ivory and Hearst [19].",
        "Their goal was to build a model of Web sites that are considered high quality from the perspective of content, structure and navigation, visual design, functionality, interactivity, and overall experience.",
        "They used over 100 page level features, as well as features encompassing the performance and structure of the site.",
        "This let them qualitatively describe the qualities of a page that make it appear attractive (e.g., rare use of italics, at least 9 point font, …), and (in later work) to build a system that assists novel Web page authors in creating quality pages by evaluating it according to these features.",
        "The primary differences between this work and ours are the goal (discovering what constitutes a good Web page vs. ordering Web pages for the purposes of Web search), the size of the study (they used a dataset of less than 6000 pages vs. our set of 468,000), and our comparison with PageRank. y = 0.577Ln(x) + 58.283 R 2 = 0.9822 58 58.5 59 59.5 60 60.5 61 1 10 100 Days of Toolbar Data PairwiseAccuracy Figure 1: Relation between the amount of popularity data and the performance of the popularity feature set.",
        "Note the x-axis is a logarithmic scale. 713 Nevertheless, their work provides insights to additional useful static features that we could incorporate into fRank in the future.",
        "Recent work on incorporating novel features into dynamic ranking includes that by Joachims et al. [21], who investigate the use of implicit feedback from users, in the form of which search engine results are clicked on.",
        "Craswell et al. [11] present a method for determining the best transformation to apply to query independent features (such as those used in this paper) for the purposes of improving dynamic ranking.",
        "Other work, such as Boyan et al. [4] and Bartell et al. [2] apply machine learning for the purposes of improving the overall relevance of a search engine (i.e., the dynamic ranking).",
        "They do not apply their techniques to the problem of static ranking. 6.3 Future work There are many ways in which we would like to extend this work.",
        "First, fRank uses only a small number of features.",
        "We believe we could achieve even more significant results with more features.",
        "In particular the existence, or lack thereof, of certain words could prove very significant (for instance, under construction probably signifies a low quality page).",
        "Other features could include the number of images on a page, size of those images, number of layout elements (tables, divs, and spans), use of style sheets, conforming to W3C standards (like XHTML 1.0 Strict), background color of a page, etc.",
        "Many pages are generated dynamically, the contents of which may depend on parameters in the URL, the time of day, the user visiting the site, or other variables.",
        "For such pages, it may be useful to apply the techniques found in [26] to form a static approximation for the purposes of extracting features.",
        "The resulting grammar describing the page could itself be a source of additional features describing the complexity of the page, such as how many non-terminal nodes it has, the depth of the grammar tree, etc. fRank allows one to specify a confidence in each pairing of documents.",
        "In the future, we will experiment with probabilities that depend on the difference in human judgments between the two items in the pair.",
        "For example, a pair of documents where one was rated 4 and the other 0 should have a higher confidence than a pair of documents rated 3 and 2.",
        "The experiments in this paper are biased toward pages that have higher than average quality.",
        "Also, fRank with all of the features can only be applied to pages that have already been crawled.",
        "Thus, fRank is primarily useful for index ordering and improving relevance, not for directing the crawl.",
        "We would like to investigate a machine learning approach for crawl prioritization as well.",
        "It may be that a combination of methods is best: for example, using PageRank to select the best 5 billion of the 20 billion pages on the Web, then using fRank to order the index and affect search relevancy.",
        "Another interesting direction for exploration is to incorporate fRank and page-level features directly into the PageRank computation itself.",
        "Work on biasing the PageRank jump vector [16], and transition matrix [29], have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of such an approach.",
        "There is reason to believe that a direct application of [29], using the fRank of a page for its relevance, could lead to an improved overall static rank.",
        "Finally, the popularity data can be used in other interesting ways.",
        "The general surfing and searching habits of Web users varies by time of day.",
        "Activity in the morning, daytime, and evening are often quite different (e.g., reading the news, solving problems, and accessing entertainment, respectively).",
        "We can gain insight into these differences by using the popularity data, divided into segments of the day.",
        "When a query is issued, we would then use the popularity data matching the time of query in order to do the ranking of Web pages.",
        "We also plan to explore popularity features that use more than just the counts of how often a page was visited.",
        "For example, how long users tended to dwell on a page, did they leave the page by clicking a link or by hitting the back button, etc.",
        "Fox et al. did a study that showed that features such as this can be valuable for the purposes of dynamic ranking [14].",
        "Finally, the popularity data could be used as the label rather than as a feature.",
        "Using fRank in this way to predict the popularity of a page may useful for the tasks of relevance, efficiency, and crawl priority.",
        "There is also significantly more popularity data than human labeled data, potentially enabling more complex machine learning methods, and significantly more features. 7.",
        "CONCLUSIONS A good static ranking is an important component for todays search engines and information retrieval systems.",
        "We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank.",
        "By combining many static features, fRank achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise accuracy than PageRank alone.",
        "A qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that Web users, rather than Web authors, visit.",
        "The machine learning component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further developments in the machine learning community in areas such as adversarial classification.",
        "We have only begun to explore the options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the area of static ranking by further experimentation with additional features, other machine learning techniques, and additional sources of data. 8.",

                "Unfortunately, this growth has not been isolated to good-quality pages.",
                "The number of incorrect, spamming, and malicious (e.g., phishing) sites has also grown rapidly.",
                "The sheer number of both good and bad pages on the Web has led to an increasing reliance on search engines for the discovery of useful information.",
                "Users rely on search engines not only to return pages related to their search query, but also to separate the good from the bad, and order results so that the best pages are suggested first.",
                "To date, most work on Web page ranking has focused on improving the ordering of the results returned to the user (querydependent ranking, or dynamic ranking).",
                "However, having a good query-independent ranking (static ranking) is also crucially important for a search engine.",
                "A good static ranking algorithm provides numerous benefits: • Relevance: The static rank of a page provides a general indicator to the overall quality of the page.",
                "This is a useful input to the dynamic ranking algorithm. • Efficiency: Typically, the search engines index is ordered by static rank.",
                "By traversing the index from highquality to low-quality pages, the dynamic ranker may abort the search when it determines that no later page will have as high of a dynamic rank as those already found.",
                "The more accurate the static rank, the better this early-stopping ability, and hence the quicker the search engine may respond to queries. • Crawl Priority: The Web grows and changes as quickly as search engines can crawl it.",
                "Search engines need a way to prioritize their crawl-to determine which pages to recrawl, how frequently, and how often to seek out new pages.",
                "Among other factors, the static rank of a page is used to determine this prioritization.",
                "A better static rank thus provides the engine with a higher quality, more upto-date index.",
                "Google is often regarded as the first commercially successful search engine.",
                "Their ranking was originally based on the <br>pagerank</br> algorithm [5][27].",
                "Due to this (and possibly due to Googles promotion of <br>pagerank</br> to the public), <br>pagerank</br> is widely regarded as the best method for the static ranking of Web pages.",
                "Though <br>pagerank</br> has historically been thought to perform quite well, there has yet been little academic evidence to support this claim.",
                "Even worse, there has recently been work showing that <br>pagerank</br> may not perform any better than other simple measures on certain tasks.",
                "Upstill et al. have found that for the task of finding home pages, the number of pages linking to a page and the type of URL were as, or more, effective than <br>pagerank</br> [32].",
                "They found similar results for the task of finding high quality companies [31].",
                "<br>pagerank</br> has also been used in systems for TRECs very large collection and Web track competitions, but with much less success than had been expected [17].",
                "Finally, Amento et al. [1] found that simple features, such as the number of pages on a site, performed as well as <br>pagerank</br>.",
                "Despite these, the general belief remains among many, both academic and in the public, that <br>pagerank</br> is an essential factor for a good static rank.",
                "Failing this, it is still assumed that using the link structure is crucial, in the form of the number of inlinks or the amount of anchor text.",
                "In this paper, we show there are a number of simple url- or pagebased features that significantly outperform <br>pagerank</br> (for the purposes of statically ranking Web pages) despite ignoring the structure of the Web.",
                "We combine these and other static features using machine learning to achieve a ranking system that is significantly better than <br>pagerank</br> (in pairwise agreement with human labels).",
                "A machine learning approach for static ranking has other advantages besides the quality of the ranking.",
                "Because the measure consists of many features, it is harder for malicious users to manipulate it (i.e., to raise their pages static rank to an undeserved level through questionable techniques, also known as Web spamming).",
                "This is particularly true if the feature set is not known.",
                "In contrast, a single measure like <br>pagerank</br> can be easier to manipulate because spammers need only concentrate on one goal: how to cause more pages to point to their page.",
                "With an algorithm that learns, a feature that becomes unusable due to spammer manipulation will simply be reduced or removed from the final computation of rank.",
                "This flexibility allows a ranking system to rapidly react to new spamming techniques.",
                "A machine learning approach to static ranking is also able to take advantage of any advances in the machine learning field.",
                "For example, recent work on adversarial classification [12] suggests that it may be possible to explicitly model the Web page spammers (the adversary) actions, adjusting the ranking model in advance of the spammers attempts to circumvent it.",
                "Another example is the elimination of outliers in constructing the model, which helps reduce the effect that unique sites may have on the overall quality of the static rank.",
                "By moving static ranking to a machine learning framework, we not only gain in accuracy, but also gain in the ability to react to spammers actions, to rapidly add new features to the ranking algorithm, and to leverage advances in the rapidly growing field of machine learning.",
                "Finally, we believe there will be significant advantages to using this technique for other domains, such as searching a local hard drive or a corporations intranet.",
                "These are domains where the link structure is particularly weak (or non-existent), but there are other domain-specific features that could be just as powerful.",
                "For example, the author of an intranet page and his/her position in the organization (e.g., CEO, manager, or developer) could provide significant clues as to the importance of that page.",
                "A machine learning approach thus allows rapid development of a good static algorithm in new domains.",
                "This papers contribution is a systematic study of static features, including <br>pagerank</br>, for the purposes of (statically) ranking Web pages.",
                "Previous studies on <br>pagerank</br> typically used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g., the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages).",
                "Also, the performance of <br>pagerank</br> and other static features has typically been evaluated in the context of a complete system for dynamic ranking, or for other tasks such as question answering.",
                "In contrast, we explore the use of <br>pagerank</br> and other features for the direct task of statically ranking Web pages.",
                "We first briefly describe the <br>pagerank</br> algorithm.",
                "In Section 3 we introduce RankNet, the machine learning technique used to combine static features into a final ranking.",

                "In general, links are made by people.",
                "As such, they are indicative of the quality of the pages to which they point - when creating a page, an author presumably chooses to link to pages deemed to be of good quality.",
                "We can take advantage of this linkage information to order Web pages according to their perceived quality.",
                "Imagine a Web surfer who jumps from Web page to Web page, choosing with uniform probability which link to follow at each step.",
                "In order to reduce the effect of dead-ends or endless cycles the surfer will occasionally jump to a random page with some small probability α, or when on a page with no out-links.",
                "If averaged over a sufficient number of steps, the probability the surfer is on page j at some point in time is given by the formula: ∑∈ + − = ji i iP N jP B F )()1( )( α α (1) Where Fi is the set of pages that page i links to, and Bj is the set of pages that link to page j.",
                "The <br>pagerank</br> score for node j is defined as this probability: PR(j)=P(j).",
                "Because equation (1) is recursive, it must be iteratively evaluated until P(j) converges (typically, the initial distribution for P(j) is uniform).",
                "The intuition is, because a random surfer would end up at the page more frequently, it is likely a better page.",
                "An alternative view for equation (1) is that each page is assigned a quality, P(j).",

                "The closest similar work is on using click-through behavior (that is, which search engine results the users click on) to affect dynamic ranking (see e.g., [20]).",
                "Because we use a wide variety of features to come up with a static ranking, we refer to this as fRank (for feature-based ranking). fRank uses RankNet and the set of features described in this section to learn a ranking function for Web pages.",

                "Before the results, we first discuss the data, the performance metric, and the training method. 5.1 Data In order to evaluate the quality of a static ranking, we needed a gold standard defining the correct ordering for a set of pages.",
                "For this, we employed a dataset which contains human judgments for 28000 queries.",
                "For each query, a number of results are manually assigned a rating, from 0 to 4, by human judges.",
                "The rating is meant to be a measure of how relevant the result is for the query, where 0 means poor and 4 means excellent.",
                "There are approximately 500k judgments in all, or an average of 18 ratings per query.",
                "The queries are selected by randomly choosing queries from among those issued to the MSN search engine.",
                "The probability that a query is selected is proportional to its frequency among all 709 of the queries.",
                "As a result, common queries are more likely to be judged than uncommon queries.",
                "As an example of how diverse the queries are, the first four queries in the training set are chef schools, chicagoland speedway, eagles fan club, and Turkish culture.",
                "The documents selected for judging are those that we expected would, on average, be reasonably relevant (for example, the top ten documents returned by MSNs search engine).",
                "This provides significantly more information than randomly selecting documents on the Web, the vast majority of which would be irrelevant to a given query.",
                "Because of this process, the judged pages tend to be of higher quality than the average page on the Web, and tend to be pages that will be returned for common search queries.",
                "This bias is good when evaluating the quality of static ranking for the purposes of index ordering and returning relevant documents.",
                "This is because the most important portion of the index to be well-ordered and relevant is the portion that is frequently returned for search queries.",
                "Because of this bias, however, the results in this paper are not applicable to crawl prioritization.",
                "In order to obtain experimental results on crawl prioritization, we would need ratings on a random sample of Web pages.",
                "To convert the data from query-dependent to query-independent, we simply removed the query, taking the maximum over judgments for a URL that appears in more than one query.",
                "The reasoning behind this is that a page that is relevant for some query and irrelevant for another is probably a decent page and should have a high static rank.",
                "Because we evaluated the pages on queries that occur frequently, our data indicates the correct index ordering, and assigns high value to pages that are likely to be relevant to a common query.",
                "We randomly assigned queries to a training, validation, or test set, such that they contained 84%, 8%, and 8% of the queries, respectively.",
                "Each set contains all of the ratings for a given query, and no query appears in more than one set.",
                "The training set was used to train fRank.",
                "The validation set was used to select the model that had the highest performance.",
                "The test set was used for the final results.",
                "This data gives us a query-independent ordering of pages.",
                "The goal for a static ranking algorithm will be to reproduce this ordering as closely as possible.",
                "In the next section, we describe the measure we used to evaluate this. 5.2 Measure We chose to use pairwise accuracy to evaluate the quality of a static ranking.",
                "The pairwise accuracy is the fraction of time that the ranking algorithm and human judges agree on the ordering of a pair of Web pages.",
                "If S(x) is the static ranking assigned to page x, and H(x) is the human judgment of relevance for x, then consider the following sets: )}()(:,{ yHxHyx >=pH and )}()(:,{ ySxSyx >=pS The pairwise accuracy is the portion of Hp that is also contained in Sp: p pp H SH ∩ =accuracypairwise This measure was chosen for two reasons.",
                "First, the discrete human judgments provide only a partial ordering over Web pages, making it difficult to apply a measure such as the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (in the pairwise accuracy measure, a pair of documents with the same human judgment does not affect the score).",
                "Second, the pairwise accuracy has an intuitive meaning: it is the fraction of pairs of documents that, when the humans claim one is better than the other, the static rank algorithm orders them correctly. 5.3 Method We trained fRank (a RankNet based neural network) using the following parameters.",
                "We used a fully connected 2 layer network.",
                "The hidden layer had 10 hidden nodes.",
                "The input weights to this layer were all initialized to be zero.",
                "The output layer (just a single node) weights were initialized using a uniform random distribution in the range [-0.1, 0.1].",
                "We used tanh as the transfer function from the inputs to the hidden layer, and a linear function from the hidden layer to the output.",

                "The resulting grammar describing the page could itself be a source of additional features describing the complexity of the page, such as how many non-terminal nodes it has, the depth of the grammar tree, etc. fRank allows one to specify a confidence in each pairing of documents.",
                "In the future, we will experiment with probabilities that depend on the difference in human judgments between the two items in the pair.",
                "For example, a pair of documents where one was rated 4 and the other 0 should have a higher confidence than a pair of documents rated 3 and 2.",

                "Also, fRank with all of the features can only be applied to pages that have already been crawled.",

                "We would like to investigate a machine learning approach for crawl prioritization as well.",
                "It may be that a combination of methods is best: for example, using <br>pagerank</br> to select the best 5 billion of the 20 billion pages on the Web, then using fRank to order the index and affect search relevancy.",

                "We show that we can significantly outperform PageRank using features that are independent of the link structure of the Web.",
                "We gain a further boost in accuracy by using data on the frequency at which users visit Web pages.",
                "We use <br>ranknet</br>, a ranking machine learning algorithm, to combine these and other static features based on anchor text and domain characteristics.",
                "The resulting model achieves a static ranking pairwise accuracy of 67.3% (vs. 56.7% for PageRank or 50% for random).",

                "INTRODUCTION Over the past decade, the Web has grown exponentially in size.",
                "Unfortunately, this growth has not been isolated to good-quality pages.",
                "The number of incorrect, spamming, and malicious (e.g., phishing) sites has also grown rapidly.",
                "The sheer number of both good and bad pages on the Web has led to an increasing reliance on search engines for the discovery of useful information.",
                "Users rely on search engines not only to return pages related to their search query, but also to separate the good from the bad, and order results so that the best pages are suggested first.",
                "To date, most work on Web page ranking has focused on improving the ordering of the results returned to the user (querydependent ranking, or dynamic ranking).",
                "However, having a good query-independent ranking (static ranking) is also crucially important for a search engine.",
                "A good static ranking algorithm provides numerous benefits: • Relevance: The static rank of a page provides a general indicator to the overall quality of the page.",
                "This is a useful input to the dynamic ranking algorithm. • Efficiency: Typically, the search engines index is ordered by static rank.",
                "By traversing the index from highquality to low-quality pages, the dynamic ranker may abort the search when it determines that no later page will have as high of a dynamic rank as those already found.",
                "The more accurate the static rank, the better this early-stopping ability, and hence the quicker the search engine may respond to queries. • Crawl Priority: The Web grows and changes as quickly as search engines can crawl it.",
                "Search engines need a way to prioritize their crawl-to determine which pages to recrawl, how frequently, and how often to seek out new pages.",
                "Among other factors, the static rank of a page is used to determine this prioritization.",
                "A better static rank thus provides the engine with a higher quality, more upto-date index.",
                "Google is often regarded as the first commercially successful search engine.",
                "Their ranking was originally based on the PageRank algorithm [5][27].",
                "Due to this (and possibly due to Googles promotion of PageRank to the public), PageRank is widely regarded as the best method for the static ranking of Web pages.",
                "Though PageRank has historically been thought to perform quite well, there has yet been little academic evidence to support this claim.",
                "Even worse, there has recently been work showing that PageRank may not perform any better than other simple measures on certain tasks.",
                "Upstill et al. have found that for the task of finding home pages, the number of pages linking to a page and the type of URL were as, or more, effective than PageRank [32].",
                "They found similar results for the task of finding high quality companies [31].",
                "PageRank has also been used in systems for TRECs very large collection and Web track competitions, but with much less success than had been expected [17].",
                "Finally, Amento et al. [1] found that simple features, such as the number of pages on a site, performed as well as PageRank.",
                "Despite these, the general belief remains among many, both academic and in the public, that PageRank is an essential factor for a good static rank.",
                "Failing this, it is still assumed that using the link structure is crucial, in the form of the number of inlinks or the amount of anchor text.",
                "In this paper, we show there are a number of simple url- or pagebased features that significantly outperform PageRank (for the purposes of statically ranking Web pages) despite ignoring the structure of the Web.",
                "We combine these and other static features using machine learning to achieve a ranking system that is significantly better than PageRank (in pairwise agreement with human labels).",
                "A machine learning approach for static ranking has other advantages besides the quality of the ranking.",
                "Because the measure consists of many features, it is harder for malicious users to manipulate it (i.e., to raise their pages static rank to an undeserved level through questionable techniques, also known as Web spamming).",
                "This is particularly true if the feature set is not known.",
                "In contrast, a single measure like PageRank can be easier to manipulate because spammers need only concentrate on one goal: how to cause more pages to point to their page.",
                "With an algorithm that learns, a feature that becomes unusable due to spammer manipulation will simply be reduced or removed from the final computation of rank.",
                "This flexibility allows a ranking system to rapidly react to new spamming techniques.",
                "A machine learning approach to static ranking is also able to take advantage of any advances in the machine learning field.",
                "For example, recent work on adversarial classification [12] suggests that it may be possible to explicitly model the Web page spammers (the adversary) actions, adjusting the ranking model in advance of the spammers attempts to circumvent it.",
                "Another example is the elimination of outliers in constructing the model, which helps reduce the effect that unique sites may have on the overall quality of the static rank.",
                "By moving static ranking to a machine learning framework, we not only gain in accuracy, but also gain in the ability to react to spammers actions, to rapidly add new features to the ranking algorithm, and to leverage advances in the rapidly growing field of machine learning.",
                "Finally, we believe there will be significant advantages to using this technique for other domains, such as searching a local hard drive or a corporations intranet.",
                "These are domains where the link structure is particularly weak (or non-existent), but there are other domain-specific features that could be just as powerful.",
                "For example, the author of an intranet page and his/her position in the organization (e.g., CEO, manager, or developer) could provide significant clues as to the importance of that page.",
                "A machine learning approach thus allows rapid development of a good static algorithm in new domains.",
                "This papers contribution is a systematic study of static features, including PageRank, for the purposes of (statically) ranking Web pages.",
                "Previous studies on PageRank typically used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g., the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages).",
                "Also, the performance of PageRank and other static features has typically been evaluated in the context of a complete system for dynamic ranking, or for other tasks such as question answering.",
                "In contrast, we explore the use of PageRank and other features for the direct task of statically ranking Web pages.",
                "We first briefly describe the PageRank algorithm.",
                "In Section 3 we introduce <br>ranknet</br>, the machine learning technique used to combine static features into a final ranking.",
                "Section 4 describes the static features.",
                "The heart of the paper is in Section 5, which presents our experiments and results.",
                "We conclude with a discussion of related and future work. 2.",
                "PAGERANK The basic idea behind PageRank is simple: a link from a Web page to another can be seen as an endorsement of that page.",
                "In general, links are made by people.",
                "As such, they are indicative of the quality of the pages to which they point - when creating a page, an author presumably chooses to link to pages deemed to be of good quality.",
                "We can take advantage of this linkage information to order Web pages according to their perceived quality.",
                "Imagine a Web surfer who jumps from Web page to Web page, choosing with uniform probability which link to follow at each step.",
                "In order to reduce the effect of dead-ends or endless cycles the surfer will occasionally jump to a random page with some small probability α, or when on a page with no out-links.",
                "If averaged over a sufficient number of steps, the probability the surfer is on page j at some point in time is given by the formula: ∑∈ + − = ji i iP N jP B F )()1( )( α α (1) Where Fi is the set of pages that page i links to, and Bj is the set of pages that link to page j.",
                "The PageRank score for node j is defined as this probability: PR(j)=P(j).",
                "Because equation (1) is recursive, it must be iteratively evaluated until P(j) converges (typically, the initial distribution for P(j) is uniform).",
                "The intuition is, because a random surfer would end up at the page more frequently, it is likely a better page.",
                "An alternative view for equation (1) is that each page is assigned a quality, P(j).",
                "A page gives an equal share of its quality to each page it points to.",
                "PageRank is computationally expensive.",
                "Our collection of 5 billion pages contains approximately 370 billion links.",
                "Computing PageRank requires iterating over these billions of links multiple times (until convergence).",
                "It requires large amounts of memory (or very smart caching schemes that slow the computation down even further), and if spread across multiple machines, requires significant communication between them.",
                "Though much work has been done on optimizing the PageRank computation (see e.g., [25] and [6]), it remains a relatively slow, computationally expensive property to compute. 3.",
                "<br>ranknet</br> Much work in machine learning has been done on the problems of classification and regression.",
                "Let X={xi} be a collection of feature vectors (typically, a feature is any real valued number), and Y={yi} be a collection of associated classes, where yi is the class of the object described by feature vector xi.",
                "The classification problem is to learn a function f that maps yi=f(xi), for all i.",
                "When yi is real-valued as well, this is called regression.",
                "Static ranking can be seen as a regression problem.",
                "If we let xi represent features of page i, and yi be a value (say, the rank) for each page, we could learn a regression function that mapped each pages features to their rank.",
                "However, this over-constrains the problem we wish to solve.",
                "All we really care about is the order of the pages, not the actual value assigned to them.",
                "Recent work on this ranking problem [7][13][18] directly attempts to optimize the ordering of the objects, rather than the value assigned to them.",
                "For these, let Z={<i,j>} be a collection of pairs of items, where item i should be assigned a higher value than item j.",
                "The goal of the ranking problem, then, is to learn a function f such that, )()(,, ji ffji xxZ >∈∀ 708 Note that, as with learning a regression function, the result of this process is a function (f) that maps feature vectors to real values.",
                "This function can still be applied anywhere that a regressionlearned function could be applied.",
                "The only difference is the technique used to learn the function.",
                "By directly optimizing the ordering of objects, these methods are able to learn a function that does a better job of ranking than do regression techniques.",
                "We used <br>ranknet</br> [7], one of the aforementioned techniques for learning ranking functions, to learn our static rank function.",
                "<br>ranknet</br> is a straightforward modification to the standard neural network back-prop algorithm.",
                "As with back-prop, <br>ranknet</br> attempts to minimize the value of a cost function by adjusting each weight in the network according to the gradient of the cost function with respect to that weight.",
                "The difference is that, while a typical neural network cost function is based on the difference between the network output and the desired output, the <br>ranknet</br> cost function is based on the difference between a pair of network outputs.",
                "That is, for each pair of feature vectors <i,j> in the training set, <br>ranknet</br> computes the network outputs oi and oj.",
                "Since vector i is supposed to be ranked higher than vector j, the larger is oj-oi, the larger the cost.",
                "<br>ranknet</br> also allows the pairs in Z to be weighted with a confidence (posed as the probability that the pair satisfies the ordering induced by the ranking function).",
                "In this paper, we used a probability of one for all pairs.",
                "In the next section, we will discuss the features used in our feature vectors, xi. 4.",
                "FEATURES To apply <br>ranknet</br> (or other machine learning techniques) to the ranking problem, we needed to extract a set of features from each page.",
                "We divided our feature set into four, mutually exclusive, categories: page-level (Page), domain-level (Domain), anchor text and inlinks (Anchor), and popularity (Popularity).",
                "We also optionally used the PageRank of a page as a feature.",
                "Below, we describe each of these feature categories in more detail.",
                "PageRank We computed PageRank on a Web graph of 5 billion crawled pages (and 20 billion known URLs linked to by these pages).",
                "This represents a significant portion of the Web, and is approximately the same number of pages as are used by Google, Yahoo, and MSN for their search engines.",
                "Because PageRank is a graph-based algorithm, it is important that it be run on as large a subset of the Web as possible.",
                "Most previous studies on PageRank used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g. the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages) We computed PageRank using the standard value of 0.85 for α.",
                "Popularity Another feature we used is the actual popularity of a Web page, measured as the number of times that it has been visited by users over some period of time.",
                "We have access to such data from users who have installed the MSN toolbar and have opted to provide it to MSN.",
                "The data is aggregated into a count, for each Web page, of the number of users who viewed that page.",
                "Though popularity data is generally unavailable, there are two other sources for it.",
                "The first is from proxy logs.",
                "For example, a university that requires its students to use a proxy has a record of all the pages they have visited while on campus.",
                "Unfortunately, proxy data is quite biased and relatively small.",
                "Another source, internal to search engines, are records of which results their users clicked on.",
                "Such data was used by the search engine Direct Hit, and has recently been explored for dynamic ranking purposes [20].",
                "An advantage of the toolbar data over this is that it contains information about URL visits that are not just the result of a search.",
                "The raw popularity is processed into a number of features such as the number of times a page was viewed and the number of times any page in the domain was viewed.",
                "More details are provided in section 5.5.",
                "Anchor text and inlinks These features are based on the information associated with links to the page in question.",
                "It includes features such as the total amount of text in links pointing to the page (anchor text), the number of unique words in that text, etc.",
                "Page This category consists of features which may be determined by looking at the page (and its URL) alone.",
                "We used only eight, simple features such as the number of words in the body, the frequency of the most common term, etc.",
                "Domain This category contains features that are computed as averages across all pages in the domain.",
                "For example, the average number of outlinks on any page and the average PageRank.",
                "Many of these features have been used by others for ranking Web pages, particularly the anchor and page features.",
                "As mentioned, the evaluation is typically for dynamic ranking, and we wish to evaluate the use of them for static ranking.",
                "Also, to our knowledge, this is the first study on the use of actual page visitation popularity for static ranking.",
                "The closest similar work is on using click-through behavior (that is, which search engine results the users click on) to affect dynamic ranking (see e.g., [20]).",
                "Because we use a wide variety of features to come up with a static ranking, we refer to this as fRank (for feature-based ranking). fRank uses <br>ranknet</br> and the set of features described in this section to learn a ranking function for Web pages.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, fRank was trained with all of the features. 5.",
                "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we will demonstrate that we can out perform PageRank by applying machine learning to a straightforward set of features.",
                "Before the results, we first discuss the data, the performance metric, and the training method. 5.1 Data In order to evaluate the quality of a static ranking, we needed a gold standard defining the correct ordering for a set of pages.",
                "For this, we employed a dataset which contains human judgments for 28000 queries.",
                "For each query, a number of results are manually assigned a rating, from 0 to 4, by human judges.",
                "The rating is meant to be a measure of how relevant the result is for the query, where 0 means poor and 4 means excellent.",
                "There are approximately 500k judgments in all, or an average of 18 ratings per query.",
                "The queries are selected by randomly choosing queries from among those issued to the MSN search engine.",
                "The probability that a query is selected is proportional to its frequency among all 709 of the queries.",
                "As a result, common queries are more likely to be judged than uncommon queries.",
                "As an example of how diverse the queries are, the first four queries in the training set are chef schools, chicagoland speedway, eagles fan club, and Turkish culture.",
                "The documents selected for judging are those that we expected would, on average, be reasonably relevant (for example, the top ten documents returned by MSNs search engine).",
                "This provides significantly more information than randomly selecting documents on the Web, the vast majority of which would be irrelevant to a given query.",
                "Because of this process, the judged pages tend to be of higher quality than the average page on the Web, and tend to be pages that will be returned for common search queries.",
                "This bias is good when evaluating the quality of static ranking for the purposes of index ordering and returning relevant documents.",
                "This is because the most important portion of the index to be well-ordered and relevant is the portion that is frequently returned for search queries.",
                "Because of this bias, however, the results in this paper are not applicable to crawl prioritization.",
                "In order to obtain experimental results on crawl prioritization, we would need ratings on a random sample of Web pages.",
                "To convert the data from query-dependent to query-independent, we simply removed the query, taking the maximum over judgments for a URL that appears in more than one query.",
                "The reasoning behind this is that a page that is relevant for some query and irrelevant for another is probably a decent page and should have a high static rank.",
                "Because we evaluated the pages on queries that occur frequently, our data indicates the correct index ordering, and assigns high value to pages that are likely to be relevant to a common query.",
                "We randomly assigned queries to a training, validation, or test set, such that they contained 84%, 8%, and 8% of the queries, respectively.",
                "Each set contains all of the ratings for a given query, and no query appears in more than one set.",
                "The training set was used to train fRank.",
                "The validation set was used to select the model that had the highest performance.",
                "The test set was used for the final results.",
                "This data gives us a query-independent ordering of pages.",
                "The goal for a static ranking algorithm will be to reproduce this ordering as closely as possible.",
                "In the next section, we describe the measure we used to evaluate this. 5.2 Measure We chose to use pairwise accuracy to evaluate the quality of a static ranking.",
                "The pairwise accuracy is the fraction of time that the ranking algorithm and human judges agree on the ordering of a pair of Web pages.",
                "If S(x) is the static ranking assigned to page x, and H(x) is the human judgment of relevance for x, then consider the following sets: )}()(:,{ yHxHyx >=pH and )}()(:,{ ySxSyx >=pS The pairwise accuracy is the portion of Hp that is also contained in Sp: p pp H SH ∩ =accuracypairwise This measure was chosen for two reasons.",
                "First, the discrete human judgments provide only a partial ordering over Web pages, making it difficult to apply a measure such as the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (in the pairwise accuracy measure, a pair of documents with the same human judgment does not affect the score).",
                "Second, the pairwise accuracy has an intuitive meaning: it is the fraction of pairs of documents that, when the humans claim one is better than the other, the static rank algorithm orders them correctly. 5.3 Method We trained fRank (a <br>ranknet</br> based neural network) using the following parameters.",
                "We used a fully connected 2 layer network.",
                "The hidden layer had 10 hidden nodes.",
                "The input weights to this layer were all initialized to be zero.",
                "The output layer (just a single node) weights were initialized using a uniform random distribution in the range [-0.1, 0.1].",
                "We used tanh as the transfer function from the inputs to the hidden layer, and a linear function from the hidden layer to the output.",
                "The cost function is the pairwise cross entropy cost function as discussed in section 3.",
                "The features in the training set were normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.",
                "The same linear transformation was then applied to the features in the validation and test sets.",
                "For training, we presented the network with 5 million pairings of pages, where one page had a higher rating than the other.",
                "The pairings were chosen uniformly at random (with replacement) from all possible pairings.",
                "When forming the pairs, we ignored the magnitude of the difference between the ratings (the rating spread) for the two URLs.",
                "Hence, the weight for each pair was constant (one), and the probability of a pair being selected was independent of its rating spread.",
                "We trained the network for 30 epochs.",
                "On each epoch, the training pairs were randomly shuffled.",

                "In our experiments, computing the fRank for all five billion Web pages was approximately 100 times faster than computing the PageRank for the same set. 5.4 Results As Table 1 shows, fRank significantly outperforms PageRank for the purposes of static ranking.",

                "Second, the popularity data is more timely than PageRanks link information.",
                "The toolbar provides information about which Web pages people find interesting right now, whereas links are added to pages more slowly, as authors find the time and interest. 6.",
                "RELATED AND FUTURE WORK 6.1 Improvements to PageRank Since the original PageRank paper, there has been work on improving it.",

                "One recognized problem with PageRank is that of topic drift: A page about dogs will have high PageRank if it is linked to by many pages that themselves have high rank, regardless of their topic.",
                "In contrast, a search engine user looking for good pages about dogs would likely prefer to find pages that are pointed to by many pages that are themselves about dogs.",
                "Hence, a link that is on topic should have higher weight than a link that is not.",
                "Richardson and Domingoss Query Dependent PageRank [29] and Haveliwalas Topic-Sensitive PageRank [16] are two approaches that tackle this problem.",
                "Other variations to PageRank include differently weighting links for inter- vs. intra-domain links, adding a backwards step to the random surfer to simulate the back button on most browsers [24] and modifying the jump probability (α) [3].",
                "See Langville and Meyer [23] for a good survey of these, and other modifications to PageRank. 6.2 Other related work PageRank is not the only link analysis algorithm used for ranking Web pages.",

                "Previous work has shown HITS to perform comparably to PageRank [1].",
                "One field of interest is that of static index pruning (see e.g., Carmel et al. [8]).",
                "Static index pruning methods reduce the size of the search engines index by removing documents that are unlikely to be returned by a search query.",
                "The pruning is typically done based on the frequency of query terms.",

                "They argue that pages with high PageRank are more likely to be found by Web users, thus more likely to be linked to, and thus more likely to maintain a higher PageRank than other pages.",

                "Other work, such as Boyan et al. [4] and Bartell et al. [2] apply machine learning for the purposes of improving the overall relevance of a search engine (i.e., the dynamic ranking).",
                "They do not apply their techniques to the problem of static ranking. 6.3 Future work There are many ways in which we would like to extend this work.",
                "First, fRank uses only a small number of features.",
                "We believe we could achieve even more significant results with more features.",
                "In particular the existence, or lack thereof, of certain words could prove very significant (for instance, under construction probably signifies a low quality page).",
                "Other features could include the number of images on a page, size of those images, number of layout elements (tables, divs, and spans), use of style sheets, conforming to W3C standards (like XHTML 1.0 Strict), background color of a page, etc.",
                "Many pages are generated dynamically, the contents of which may depend on parameters in the URL, the time of day, the user visiting the site, or other variables.",
                "For such pages, it may be useful to apply the techniques found in [26] to form a static approximation for the purposes of extracting features.",
                "The resulting grammar describing the page could itself be a source of additional features describing the complexity of the page, such as how many non-terminal nodes it has, the depth of the grammar tree, etc. fRank allows one to specify a confidence in each pairing of documents.",
                "In the future, we will experiment with probabilities that depend on the difference in human judgments between the two items in the pair.",
                "For example, a pair of documents where one was rated 4 and the other 0 should have a higher confidence than a pair of documents rated 3 and 2.",
                "The experiments in this paper are biased toward pages that have higher than average quality.",
                "Also, fRank with all of the features can only be applied to pages that have already been crawled.",
                "Thus, fRank is primarily useful for index ordering and improving relevance, not for directing the crawl.",
                "We would like to investigate a machine learning approach for crawl prioritization as well.",
                "It may be that a combination of methods is best: for example, using PageRank to select the best 5 billion of the 20 billion pages on the Web, then using fRank to order the index and affect search relevancy.",
                "Another interesting direction for exploration is to incorporate fRank and page-level features directly into the PageRank computation itself.",
                "Work on biasing the PageRank jump vector [16], and transition matrix [29], have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of such an approach.",
                "There is reason to believe that a direct application of [29], using the fRank of a page for its relevance, could lead to an improved overall static rank.",
                "Finally, the popularity data can be used in other interesting ways.",
                "The general surfing and searching habits of Web users varies by time of day.",
                "Activity in the morning, daytime, and evening are often quite different (e.g., reading the news, solving problems, and accessing entertainment, respectively).",
                "We can gain insight into these differences by using the popularity data, divided into segments of the day.",
                "When a query is issued, we would then use the popularity data matching the time of query in order to do the ranking of Web pages.",
                "We also plan to explore popularity features that use more than just the counts of how often a page was visited.",
                "For example, how long users tended to dwell on a page, did they leave the page by clicking a link or by hitting the back button, etc.",
                "Fox et al. did a study that showed that features such as this can be valuable for the purposes of dynamic ranking [14].",
                "Finally, the popularity data could be used as the label rather than as a feature.",
                "Using fRank in this way to predict the popularity of a page may useful for the tasks of relevance, efficiency, and crawl priority.",
                "There is also significantly more popularity data than human labeled data, potentially enabling more complex machine learning methods, and significantly more features. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS A good static ranking is an important component for todays search engines and information retrieval systems.",
                "We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank.",
                "By combining many static features, fRank achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise accuracy than PageRank alone.",
                "A qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that Web users, rather than Web authors, visit.",
                "The machine learning component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further developments in the machine learning community in areas such as adversarial classification.",
                "We have only begun to explore the options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the area of static ranking by further experimentation with additional features, other machine learning techniques, and additional sources of data. 8.",

                "The number of incorrect, spamming, and malicious (e.g., phishing) sites has also grown rapidly.",
                "The sheer number of both good and bad pages on the Web has led to an increasing reliance on search engines for the discovery of useful information.",
                "Users rely on search engines not only to return pages related to their search query, but also to separate the good from the bad, and order results so that the best pages are suggested first.",
                "To date, most work on Web page ranking has focused on improving the ordering of the results returned to the user (querydependent ranking, or dynamic ranking).",
                "However, having a good query-independent ranking (<br>static ranking</br>) is also crucially important for a search engine.",
                "A good <br>static ranking</br> algorithm provides numerous benefits: • Relevance: The static rank of a page provides a general indicator to the overall quality of the page.",
                "This is a useful input to the dynamic ranking algorithm. • Efficiency: Typically, the search engines index is ordered by static rank.",
                "By traversing the index from highquality to low-quality pages, the dynamic ranker may abort the search when it determines that no later page will have as high of a dynamic rank as those already found.",
                "The more accurate the static rank, the better this early-stopping ability, and hence the quicker the search engine may respond to queries. • Crawl Priority: The Web grows and changes as quickly as search engines can crawl it.",
                "Search engines need a way to prioritize their crawl-to determine which pages to recrawl, how frequently, and how often to seek out new pages.",
                "Among other factors, the static rank of a page is used to determine this prioritization.",
                "A better static rank thus provides the engine with a higher quality, more upto-date index.",
                "Google is often regarded as the first commercially successful search engine.",
                "Their ranking was originally based on the PageRank algorithm [5][27].",
                "Due to this (and possibly due to Googles promotion of PageRank to the public), PageRank is widely regarded as the best method for the <br>static ranking</br> of Web pages.",
                "Though PageRank has historically been thought to perform quite well, there has yet been little academic evidence to support this claim.",
                "Even worse, there has recently been work showing that PageRank may not perform any better than other simple measures on certain tasks.",
                "Upstill et al. have found that for the task of finding home pages, the number of pages linking to a page and the type of URL were as, or more, effective than PageRank [32].",
                "They found similar results for the task of finding high quality companies [31].",
                "PageRank has also been used in systems for TRECs very large collection and Web track competitions, but with much less success than had been expected [17].",
                "Finally, Amento et al. [1] found that simple features, such as the number of pages on a site, performed as well as PageRank.",
                "Despite these, the general belief remains among many, both academic and in the public, that PageRank is an essential factor for a good static rank.",
                "Failing this, it is still assumed that using the link structure is crucial, in the form of the number of inlinks or the amount of anchor text.",
                "In this paper, we show there are a number of simple url- or pagebased features that significantly outperform PageRank (for the purposes of statically ranking Web pages) despite ignoring the structure of the Web.",
                "We combine these and other static features using machine learning to achieve a ranking system that is significantly better than PageRank (in pairwise agreement with human labels).",
                "A machine learning approach for <br>static ranking</br> has other advantages besides the quality of the ranking.",
                "Because the measure consists of many features, it is harder for malicious users to manipulate it (i.e., to raise their pages static rank to an undeserved level through questionable techniques, also known as Web spamming).",
                "This is particularly true if the feature set is not known.",
                "In contrast, a single measure like PageRank can be easier to manipulate because spammers need only concentrate on one goal: how to cause more pages to point to their page.",
                "With an algorithm that learns, a feature that becomes unusable due to spammer manipulation will simply be reduced or removed from the final computation of rank.",
                "This flexibility allows a ranking system to rapidly react to new spamming techniques.",
                "A machine learning approach to <br>static ranking</br> is also able to take advantage of any advances in the machine learning field.",
                "For example, recent work on adversarial classification [12] suggests that it may be possible to explicitly model the Web page spammers (the adversary) actions, adjusting the ranking model in advance of the spammers attempts to circumvent it.",
                "Another example is the elimination of outliers in constructing the model, which helps reduce the effect that unique sites may have on the overall quality of the static rank.",
                "By moving <br>static ranking</br> to a machine learning framework, we not only gain in accuracy, but also gain in the ability to react to spammers actions, to rapidly add new features to the ranking algorithm, and to leverage advances in the rapidly growing field of machine learning.",
                "Finally, we believe there will be significant advantages to using this technique for other domains, such as searching a local hard drive or a corporations intranet.",
                "These are domains where the link structure is particularly weak (or non-existent), but there are other domain-specific features that could be just as powerful.",
                "For example, the author of an intranet page and his/her position in the organization (e.g., CEO, manager, or developer) could provide significant clues as to the importance of that page.",
                "A machine learning approach thus allows rapid development of a good static algorithm in new domains.",
                "This papers contribution is a systematic study of static features, including PageRank, for the purposes of (statically) ranking Web pages.",
                "Previous studies on PageRank typically used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g., the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages).",
                "Also, the performance of PageRank and other static features has typically been evaluated in the context of a complete system for dynamic ranking, or for other tasks such as question answering.",
                "In contrast, we explore the use of PageRank and other features for the direct task of statically ranking Web pages.",
                "We first briefly describe the PageRank algorithm.",
                "In Section 3 we introduce RankNet, the machine learning technique used to combine static features into a final ranking.",

                "In the next section, we will discuss the features used in our feature vectors, xi. 4.",
                "FEATURES To apply RankNet (or other machine learning techniques) to the ranking problem, we needed to extract a set of features from each page.",
                "We divided our feature set into four, mutually exclusive, categories: page-level (Page), domain-level (Domain), anchor text and inlinks (Anchor), and popularity (Popularity).",
                "We also optionally used the PageRank of a page as a feature.",
                "Below, we describe each of these feature categories in more detail.",
                "PageRank We computed PageRank on a Web graph of 5 billion crawled pages (and 20 billion known URLs linked to by these pages).",
                "This represents a significant portion of the Web, and is approximately the same number of pages as are used by Google, Yahoo, and MSN for their search engines.",
                "Because PageRank is a graph-based algorithm, it is important that it be run on as large a subset of the Web as possible.",
                "Most previous studies on PageRank used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g. the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages) We computed PageRank using the standard value of 0.85 for α.",
                "Popularity Another feature we used is the actual popularity of a Web page, measured as the number of times that it has been visited by users over some period of time.",
                "We have access to such data from users who have installed the MSN toolbar and have opted to provide it to MSN.",
                "The data is aggregated into a count, for each Web page, of the number of users who viewed that page.",
                "Though popularity data is generally unavailable, there are two other sources for it.",
                "The first is from proxy logs.",
                "For example, a university that requires its students to use a proxy has a record of all the pages they have visited while on campus.",
                "Unfortunately, proxy data is quite biased and relatively small.",
                "Another source, internal to search engines, are records of which results their users clicked on.",
                "Such data was used by the search engine Direct Hit, and has recently been explored for dynamic ranking purposes [20].",
                "An advantage of the toolbar data over this is that it contains information about URL visits that are not just the result of a search.",
                "The raw popularity is processed into a number of features such as the number of times a page was viewed and the number of times any page in the domain was viewed.",
                "More details are provided in section 5.5.",
                "Anchor text and inlinks These features are based on the information associated with links to the page in question.",
                "It includes features such as the total amount of text in links pointing to the page (anchor text), the number of unique words in that text, etc.",
                "Page This category consists of features which may be determined by looking at the page (and its URL) alone.",
                "We used only eight, simple features such as the number of words in the body, the frequency of the most common term, etc.",
                "Domain This category contains features that are computed as averages across all pages in the domain.",
                "For example, the average number of outlinks on any page and the average PageRank.",
                "Many of these features have been used by others for ranking Web pages, particularly the anchor and page features.",
                "As mentioned, the evaluation is typically for dynamic ranking, and we wish to evaluate the use of them for <br>static ranking</br>.",
                "Also, to our knowledge, this is the first study on the use of actual page visitation popularity for <br>static ranking</br>.",
                "The closest similar work is on using click-through behavior (that is, which search engine results the users click on) to affect dynamic ranking (see e.g., [20]).",
                "Because we use a wide variety of features to come up with a <br>static ranking</br>, we refer to this as fRank (for feature-based ranking). fRank uses RankNet and the set of features described in this section to learn a ranking function for Web pages.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, fRank was trained with all of the features. 5.",
                "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we will demonstrate that we can out perform PageRank by applying machine learning to a straightforward set of features.",
                "Before the results, we first discuss the data, the performance metric, and the training method. 5.1 Data In order to evaluate the quality of a <br>static ranking</br>, we needed a gold standard defining the correct ordering for a set of pages.",
                "For this, we employed a dataset which contains human judgments for 28000 queries.",
                "For each query, a number of results are manually assigned a rating, from 0 to 4, by human judges.",
                "The rating is meant to be a measure of how relevant the result is for the query, where 0 means poor and 4 means excellent.",
                "There are approximately 500k judgments in all, or an average of 18 ratings per query.",
                "The queries are selected by randomly choosing queries from among those issued to the MSN search engine.",
                "The probability that a query is selected is proportional to its frequency among all 709 of the queries.",
                "As a result, common queries are more likely to be judged than uncommon queries.",
                "As an example of how diverse the queries are, the first four queries in the training set are chef schools, chicagoland speedway, eagles fan club, and Turkish culture.",
                "The documents selected for judging are those that we expected would, on average, be reasonably relevant (for example, the top ten documents returned by MSNs search engine).",
                "This provides significantly more information than randomly selecting documents on the Web, the vast majority of which would be irrelevant to a given query.",
                "Because of this process, the judged pages tend to be of higher quality than the average page on the Web, and tend to be pages that will be returned for common search queries.",
                "This bias is good when evaluating the quality of <br>static ranking</br> for the purposes of index ordering and returning relevant documents.",
                "This is because the most important portion of the index to be well-ordered and relevant is the portion that is frequently returned for search queries.",
                "Because of this bias, however, the results in this paper are not applicable to crawl prioritization.",
                "In order to obtain experimental results on crawl prioritization, we would need ratings on a random sample of Web pages.",
                "To convert the data from query-dependent to query-independent, we simply removed the query, taking the maximum over judgments for a URL that appears in more than one query.",
                "The reasoning behind this is that a page that is relevant for some query and irrelevant for another is probably a decent page and should have a high static rank.",
                "Because we evaluated the pages on queries that occur frequently, our data indicates the correct index ordering, and assigns high value to pages that are likely to be relevant to a common query.",
                "We randomly assigned queries to a training, validation, or test set, such that they contained 84%, 8%, and 8% of the queries, respectively.",
                "Each set contains all of the ratings for a given query, and no query appears in more than one set.",
                "The training set was used to train fRank.",
                "The validation set was used to select the model that had the highest performance.",
                "The test set was used for the final results.",
                "This data gives us a query-independent ordering of pages.",
                "The goal for a <br>static ranking</br> algorithm will be to reproduce this ordering as closely as possible.",
                "In the next section, we describe the measure we used to evaluate this. 5.2 Measure We chose to use pairwise accuracy to evaluate the quality of a <br>static ranking</br>.",
                "The pairwise accuracy is the fraction of time that the ranking algorithm and human judges agree on the ordering of a pair of Web pages.",
                "If S(x) is the <br>static ranking</br> assigned to page x, and H(x) is the human judgment of relevance for x, then consider the following sets: )}()(:,{ yHxHyx >=pH and )}()(:,{ ySxSyx >=pS The pairwise accuracy is the portion of Hp that is also contained in Sp: p pp H SH ∩ =accuracypairwise This measure was chosen for two reasons.",
                "First, the discrete human judgments provide only a partial ordering over Web pages, making it difficult to apply a measure such as the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (in the pairwise accuracy measure, a pair of documents with the same human judgment does not affect the score).",
                "Second, the pairwise accuracy has an intuitive meaning: it is the fraction of pairs of documents that, when the humans claim one is better than the other, the static rank algorithm orders them correctly. 5.3 Method We trained fRank (a RankNet based neural network) using the following parameters.",
                "We used a fully connected 2 layer network.",
                "The hidden layer had 10 hidden nodes.",
                "The input weights to this layer were all initialized to be zero.",
                "The output layer (just a single node) weights were initialized using a uniform random distribution in the range [-0.1, 0.1].",
                "We used tanh as the transfer function from the inputs to the hidden layer, and a linear function from the hidden layer to the output.",
                "The cost function is the pairwise cross entropy cost function as discussed in section 3.",
                "The features in the training set were normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.",
                "The same linear transformation was then applied to the features in the validation and test sets.",
                "For training, we presented the network with 5 million pairings of pages, where one page had a higher rating than the other.",
                "The pairings were chosen uniformly at random (with replacement) from all possible pairings.",
                "When forming the pairs, we ignored the magnitude of the difference between the ratings (the rating spread) for the two URLs.",
                "Hence, the weight for each pair was constant (one), and the probability of a pair being selected was independent of its rating spread.",
                "We trained the network for 30 epochs.",
                "On each epoch, the training pairs were randomly shuffled.",
                "The initial training rate was 0.001.",
                "At each epoch, we checked the error on the training set.",
                "If the error had increased, then we decreased the training rate, under the hypothesis that the network had probably overshot.",
                "The training rate at each epoch was thus set to: Training rate = 1+ε κ Where κ is the initial rate (0.001), and ε is the number of times the training set error has increased.",
                "After each epoch, we measured the performance of the neural network on the validation set, using 1 million pairs (chosen randomly with replacement).",
                "The network with the highest pairwise accuracy on the validation set was selected, and then tested on the test set.",
                "We report the pairwise accuracy on the test set, calculated using all possible pairs.",
                "These parameters were determined and fixed before the static rank experiments in this paper.",
                "In particular, the choice of initial training rate, number of epochs, and training rate decay function were taken directly from Burges et al [7].",
                "Though we had the option of preprocessing any of the features before they were input to the neural network, we refrained from doing so on most of them.",
                "The only exception was the popularity features.",
                "As with most Web phenomenon, we found that the distribution of site popularity is Zipfian.",
                "To reduce the dynamic range, and hopefully make the feature more useful, we presented the network with both the unpreprocessed, as well as the logarithm, of the popularity features (As with the others, the logarithmic feature values were also normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation). 710 Applying fRank to a document is computationally efficient, taking time that is only linear in the number of input features; it is thus within a constant factor of other simple machine learning methods such as naïve Bayes.",
                "In our experiments, computing the fRank for all five billion Web pages was approximately 100 times faster than computing the PageRank for the same set. 5.4 Results As Table 1 shows, fRank significantly outperforms PageRank for the purposes of <br>static ranking</br>.",
                "With a pairwise accuracy of 67.4%, fRank more than doubles the accuracy of PageRank (relative to the baseline of 50%, which is the accuracy that would be achieved by a random ordering of Web pages).",
                "Note that one of fRanks input features is the PageRank of the page, so we would expect it to perform no worse than PageRank.",
                "The significant increase in accuracy implies that the other features (anchor, popularity, etc.) do in fact contain useful information regarding the overall quality of a page.",
                "Table 1: Basic Results Technique Accuracy (%) None (Baseline) 50.00 PageRank 56.70 fRank 67.43 There are a number of decisions that go into the computation of PageRank, such as how to deal with pages that have no outlinks, the choice of α, numeric precision, convergence threshold, etc.",
                "We were able to obtain a computation of PageRank from a completely independent implementation (provided by Marc Najork) that varied somewhat in these parameters.",
                "It achieved a pairwise accuracy of 56.52%, nearly identical to that obtained by our implementation.",
                "We thus concluded that the quality of the PageRank is not sensitive to these minor variations in algorithm, nor was PageRanks low accuracy due to problems with our implementation of it.",
                "We also wanted to find how well each feature set performed.",
                "To answer this, for each feature set, we trained and tested fRank using only that set of features.",
                "The results are shown in Table 2.",
                "As can be seen, every single feature set individually outperformed PageRank on this test.",
                "Perhaps the most interesting result is that the Page-level features had the highest performance out of all the feature sets.",
                "This is surprising because these are features that do not depend on the overall graph structure of the Web, nor even on what pages point to a given page.",
                "This is contrary to the common belief that the Web graph structure is the key to finding a good <br>static ranking</br> of Web pages.",

                "This means that a particular feature that appears to have little value in isolation could actually be very important when used in combination with other features.",

                "Though these pages are important, they are not as important as it may seem by looking at the link structure alone.",
                "One fix for this is to add information about the link to the PageRank computation, such as the size of the text, whether it was at the bottom of the page, etc.",
                "The other bias comes from the fact that the population of Web site authors is different than the population of Web users.",
                "Web authors tend to be technologically-oriented, and thus their linking behavior reflects those interests. fRank, by knowing the actual visitation popularity of a site (the popularity feature set), is able to eliminate some of that bias.",

                "In contrast, a search engine user looking for good pages about dogs would likely prefer to find pages that are pointed to by many pages that are themselves about dogs.",
                "Hence, a link that is on topic should have higher weight than a link that is not.",
                "Richardson and Domingoss Query Dependent PageRank [29] and Haveliwalas Topic-Sensitive PageRank [16] are two approaches that tackle this problem.",
                "Other variations to PageRank include differently weighting links for inter- vs. intra-domain links, adding a backwards step to the random surfer to simulate the back button on most browsers [24] and modifying the jump probability (α) [3].",
                "See Langville and Meyer [23] for a good survey of these, and other modifications to PageRank. 6.2 Other related work PageRank is not the only link analysis algorithm used for ranking Web pages.",

                "HITS produces a list of hubs and authorities, where hubs are pages that point to many authority pages, and authorities are pages that are pointed to by many hubs.",
                "Previous work has shown HITS to perform comparably to PageRank [1].",
                "One field of interest is that of static index pruning (see e.g., Carmel et al. [8]).",
                "Static index pruning methods reduce the size of the search engines index by removing documents that are unlikely to be returned by a search query.",
                "The pruning is typically done based on the frequency of query terms.",
                "Similarly, Pandey and Olston [28] suggest crawling pages frequently if they are likely to incorrectly appear (or not appear) as a result of a search.",
                "Similar methods could be incorporated into the static rank (e.g., how many frequent queries contain words found on this page).",
                "Others have investigated the effect that PageRank has on the Web at large [9].",
                "They argue that pages with high PageRank are more likely to be found by Web users, thus more likely to be linked to, and thus more likely to maintain a higher PageRank than other pages.",
                "The same may occur for the popularity data.",
                "If we increase the ranking for popular pages, they are more likely to be clicked on, thus further increasing their popularity.",
                "Cho et al. [10] argue that a more appropriate measure of Web page quality would depend on not only the current link structure of the Web, but also on the change in that link structure.",
                "The same technique may be applicable to popularity data: the change in popularity of a page may be more informative than the absolute popularity.",
                "One interesting related work is that of Ivory and Hearst [19].",
                "Their goal was to build a model of Web sites that are considered high quality from the perspective of content, structure and navigation, visual design, functionality, interactivity, and overall experience.",
                "They used over 100 page level features, as well as features encompassing the performance and structure of the site.",

                "The primary differences between this work and ours are the goal (discovering what constitutes a good Web page vs. ordering Web pages for the purposes of Web search), the size of the study (they used a dataset of less than 6000 pages vs. our set of 468,000), and our comparison with PageRank. y = 0.577Ln(x) + 58.283 R 2 = 0.9822 58 58.5 59 59.5 60 60.5 61 1 10 100 Days of Toolbar Data PairwiseAccuracy Figure 1: Relation between the amount of popularity data and the performance of the popularity feature set.",
                "Note the x-axis is a logarithmic scale. 713 Nevertheless, their work provides insights to additional useful static features that we could incorporate into fRank in the future.",

                "Other work, such as Boyan et al. [4] and Bartell et al. [2] apply machine learning for the purposes of improving the overall relevance of a search engine (i.e., the dynamic ranking).",
                "They do not apply their techniques to the problem of <br>static ranking</br>. 6.3 Future work There are many ways in which we would like to extend this work.",
                "First, fRank uses only a small number of features.",
                "We believe we could achieve even more significant results with more features.",
                "In particular the existence, or lack thereof, of certain words could prove very significant (for instance, under construction probably signifies a low quality page).",
                "Other features could include the number of images on a page, size of those images, number of layout elements (tables, divs, and spans), use of style sheets, conforming to W3C standards (like XHTML 1.0 Strict), background color of a page, etc.",
                "Many pages are generated dynamically, the contents of which may depend on parameters in the URL, the time of day, the user visiting the site, or other variables.",
                "For such pages, it may be useful to apply the techniques found in [26] to form a static approximation for the purposes of extracting features.",
                "The resulting grammar describing the page could itself be a source of additional features describing the complexity of the page, such as how many non-terminal nodes it has, the depth of the grammar tree, etc. fRank allows one to specify a confidence in each pairing of documents.",
                "In the future, we will experiment with probabilities that depend on the difference in human judgments between the two items in the pair.",
                "For example, a pair of documents where one was rated 4 and the other 0 should have a higher confidence than a pair of documents rated 3 and 2.",
                "The experiments in this paper are biased toward pages that have higher than average quality.",
                "Also, fRank with all of the features can only be applied to pages that have already been crawled.",
                "Thus, fRank is primarily useful for index ordering and improving relevance, not for directing the crawl.",
                "We would like to investigate a machine learning approach for crawl prioritization as well.",
                "It may be that a combination of methods is best: for example, using PageRank to select the best 5 billion of the 20 billion pages on the Web, then using fRank to order the index and affect search relevancy.",
                "Another interesting direction for exploration is to incorporate fRank and page-level features directly into the PageRank computation itself.",
                "Work on biasing the PageRank jump vector [16], and transition matrix [29], have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of such an approach.",
                "There is reason to believe that a direct application of [29], using the fRank of a page for its relevance, could lead to an improved overall static rank.",
                "Finally, the popularity data can be used in other interesting ways.",
                "The general surfing and searching habits of Web users varies by time of day.",
                "Activity in the morning, daytime, and evening are often quite different (e.g., reading the news, solving problems, and accessing entertainment, respectively).",
                "We can gain insight into these differences by using the popularity data, divided into segments of the day.",
                "When a query is issued, we would then use the popularity data matching the time of query in order to do the ranking of Web pages.",
                "We also plan to explore popularity features that use more than just the counts of how often a page was visited.",
                "For example, how long users tended to dwell on a page, did they leave the page by clicking a link or by hitting the back button, etc.",
                "Fox et al. did a study that showed that features such as this can be valuable for the purposes of dynamic ranking [14].",
                "Finally, the popularity data could be used as the label rather than as a feature.",
                "Using fRank in this way to predict the popularity of a page may useful for the tasks of relevance, efficiency, and crawl priority.",
                "There is also significantly more popularity data than human labeled data, potentially enabling more complex machine learning methods, and significantly more features. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS A good <br>static ranking</br> is an important component for todays search engines and information retrieval systems.",
                "We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good <br>static ranking</br>; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank.",
                "By combining many static features, fRank achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise accuracy than PageRank alone.",
                "A qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that Web users, rather than Web authors, visit.",
                "The machine learning component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further developments in the machine learning community in areas such as adversarial classification.",
                "We have only begun to explore the options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the area of <br>static ranking</br> by further experimentation with additional features, other machine learning techniques, and additional sources of data. 8.",

                "We show that we can significantly outperform PageRank using features that are independent of the link structure of the Web.",
                "We gain a further boost in accuracy by using data on the frequency at which users visit Web pages.",
                "We use RankNet, a ranking machine learning algorithm, to combine these and other static features based on anchor text and domain characteristics.",
                "The resulting model achieves a static ranking pairwise accuracy of 67.3% (vs. 56.7% for PageRank or 50% for random).",

                "INTRODUCTION Over the past decade, the Web has grown exponentially in size.",
                "Unfortunately, this growth has not been isolated to good-quality pages.",
                "The number of incorrect, spamming, and malicious (e.g., phishing) sites has also grown rapidly.",
                "The sheer number of both good and bad pages on the Web has led to an increasing reliance on search engines for the discovery of useful information.",
                "Users rely on search engines not only to return pages related to their search query, but also to separate the good from the bad, and order results so that the best pages are suggested first.",
                "To date, most work on Web page ranking has focused on improving the ordering of the results returned to the user (querydependent ranking, or dynamic ranking).",
                "However, having a good query-independent ranking (static ranking) is also crucially important for a search engine.",
                "A good static ranking algorithm provides numerous benefits: • Relevance: The static rank of a page provides a general indicator to the overall quality of the page.",
                "This is a useful input to the dynamic ranking algorithm. • Efficiency: Typically, the search engines index is ordered by static rank.",
                "By traversing the index from highquality to low-quality pages, the dynamic ranker may abort the search when it determines that no later page will have as high of a dynamic rank as those already found.",
                "The more accurate the static rank, the better this early-stopping ability, and hence the quicker the search engine may respond to queries. • Crawl Priority: The Web grows and changes as quickly as search engines can crawl it.",
                "Search engines need a way to prioritize their crawl-to determine which pages to recrawl, how frequently, and how often to seek out new pages.",
                "Among other factors, the static rank of a page is used to determine this prioritization.",
                "A better static rank thus provides the engine with a higher quality, more upto-date index.",
                "Google is often regarded as the first commercially successful search engine.",
                "Their ranking was originally based on the PageRank algorithm [5][27].",
                "Due to this (and possibly due to Googles promotion of PageRank to the public), PageRank is widely regarded as the best method for the static ranking of Web pages.",
                "Though PageRank has historically been thought to perform quite well, there has yet been little academic evidence to support this claim.",
                "Even worse, there has recently been work showing that PageRank may not perform any better than other simple measures on certain tasks.",
                "Upstill et al. have found that for the task of finding home pages, the number of pages linking to a page and the type of URL were as, or more, effective than PageRank [32].",
                "They found similar results for the task of finding high quality companies [31].",
                "PageRank has also been used in systems for TRECs very large collection and Web track competitions, but with much less success than had been expected [17].",
                "Finally, Amento et al. [1] found that simple features, such as the number of pages on a site, performed as well as PageRank.",
                "Despite these, the general belief remains among many, both academic and in the public, that PageRank is an essential factor for a good static rank.",
                "Failing this, it is still assumed that using the link structure is crucial, in the form of the number of inlinks or the amount of anchor text.",
                "In this paper, we show there are a number of simple url- or pagebased features that significantly outperform PageRank (for the purposes of statically ranking Web pages) despite ignoring the structure of the Web.",
                "We combine these and other static features using machine learning to achieve a ranking system that is significantly better than PageRank (in pairwise agreement with human labels).",
                "A machine learning approach for static ranking has other advantages besides the quality of the ranking.",
                "Because the measure consists of many features, it is harder for malicious users to manipulate it (i.e., to raise their pages static rank to an undeserved level through questionable techniques, also known as Web spamming).",
                "This is particularly true if the feature set is not known.",
                "In contrast, a single measure like PageRank can be easier to manipulate because spammers need only concentrate on one goal: how to cause more pages to point to their page.",
                "With an algorithm that learns, a feature that becomes unusable due to spammer manipulation will simply be reduced or removed from the final computation of rank.",
                "This flexibility allows a ranking system to rapidly react to new spamming techniques.",
                "A machine learning approach to static ranking is also able to take advantage of any advances in the machine learning field.",
                "For example, recent work on adversarial classification [12] suggests that it may be possible to explicitly model the Web page spammers (the adversary) actions, adjusting the ranking model in advance of the spammers attempts to circumvent it.",
                "Another example is the elimination of outliers in constructing the model, which helps reduce the effect that unique sites may have on the overall quality of the static rank.",
                "By moving static ranking to a machine learning framework, we not only gain in accuracy, but also gain in the ability to react to spammers actions, to rapidly add new features to the ranking algorithm, and to leverage advances in the rapidly growing field of machine learning.",
                "Finally, we believe there will be significant advantages to using this technique for other domains, such as searching a local hard drive or a corporations intranet.",
                "These are domains where the link structure is particularly weak (or non-existent), but there are other domain-specific features that could be just as powerful.",
                "For example, the author of an intranet page and his/her position in the organization (e.g., CEO, manager, or developer) could provide significant clues as to the importance of that page.",
                "A machine learning approach thus allows rapid development of a good static algorithm in new domains.",
                "This papers contribution is a systematic study of static features, including PageRank, for the purposes of (statically) ranking Web pages.",
                "Previous studies on PageRank typically used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g., the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages).",
                "Also, the performance of PageRank and other static features has typically been evaluated in the context of a complete system for dynamic ranking, or for other tasks such as question answering.",
                "In contrast, we explore the use of PageRank and other features for the direct task of statically ranking Web pages.",
                "We first briefly describe the PageRank algorithm.",
                "In Section 3 we introduce RankNet, the machine learning technique used to combine static features into a final ranking.",
                "Section 4 describes the static features.",
                "The heart of the paper is in Section 5, which presents our experiments and results.",
                "We conclude with a discussion of related and future work. 2.",
                "PAGERANK The basic idea behind PageRank is simple: a link from a Web page to another can be seen as an endorsement of that page.",
                "In general, links are made by people.",
                "As such, they are indicative of the quality of the pages to which they point - when creating a page, an author presumably chooses to link to pages deemed to be of good quality.",
                "We can take advantage of this linkage information to order Web pages according to their perceived quality.",
                "Imagine a Web surfer who jumps from Web page to Web page, choosing with uniform probability which link to follow at each step.",
                "In order to reduce the effect of dead-ends or endless cycles the surfer will occasionally jump to a random page with some small probability α, or when on a page with no out-links.",
                "If averaged over a sufficient number of steps, the probability the surfer is on page j at some point in time is given by the formula: ∑∈ + − = ji i iP N jP B F )()1( )( α α (1) Where Fi is the set of pages that page i links to, and Bj is the set of pages that link to page j.",
                "The PageRank score for node j is defined as this probability: PR(j)=P(j).",
                "Because equation (1) is recursive, it must be iteratively evaluated until P(j) converges (typically, the initial distribution for P(j) is uniform).",
                "The intuition is, because a random surfer would end up at the page more frequently, it is likely a better page.",
                "An alternative view for equation (1) is that each page is assigned a quality, P(j).",
                "A page gives an equal share of its quality to each page it points to.",
                "PageRank is computationally expensive.",
                "Our collection of 5 billion pages contains approximately 370 billion links.",
                "Computing PageRank requires iterating over these billions of links multiple times (until convergence).",
                "It requires large amounts of memory (or very smart caching schemes that slow the computation down even further), and if spread across multiple machines, requires significant communication between them.",
                "Though much work has been done on optimizing the PageRank computation (see e.g., [25] and [6]), it remains a relatively slow, computationally expensive property to compute. 3.",
                "RANKNET Much work in machine learning has been done on the problems of classification and regression.",
                "Let X={xi} be a collection of feature vectors (typically, a feature is any real valued number), and Y={yi} be a collection of associated classes, where yi is the class of the object described by feature vector xi.",
                "The classification problem is to learn a function f that maps yi=f(xi), for all i.",
                "When yi is real-valued as well, this is called regression.",
                "Static ranking can be seen as a regression problem.",
                "If we let xi represent features of page i, and yi be a value (say, the rank) for each page, we could learn a regression function that mapped each pages features to their rank.",
                "However, this over-constrains the problem we wish to solve.",
                "All we really care about is the order of the pages, not the actual value assigned to them.",
                "Recent work on this ranking problem [7][13][18] directly attempts to optimize the ordering of the objects, rather than the value assigned to them.",

                "This function can still be applied anywhere that a regressionlearned function could be applied.",
                "The only difference is the technique used to learn the function.",
                "By directly optimizing the ordering of objects, these methods are able to learn a function that does a better job of ranking than do regression techniques.",

                "As with back-prop, RankNet attempts to minimize the value of a cost function by adjusting each weight in the network according to the gradient of the cost function with respect to that weight.",
                "The difference is that, while a typical neural network cost function is based on the difference between the network output and the desired output, the RankNet cost function is based on the difference between a pair of network outputs.",
                "That is, for each pair of feature vectors <i,j> in the training set, RankNet computes the network outputs oi and oj.",
                "Since vector i is supposed to be ranked higher than vector j, the larger is oj-oi, the larger the cost.",
                "RankNet also allows the pairs in Z to be weighted with a confidence (posed as the probability that the pair satisfies the ordering induced by the ranking function).",

                "FEATURES To apply RankNet (or other machine learning techniques) to the ranking problem, we needed to extract a set of features from each page.",
                "We divided our feature set into four, mutually exclusive, categories: page-level (Page), domain-level (Domain), anchor text and inlinks (Anchor), and popularity (Popularity).",

                "This represents a significant portion of the Web, and is approximately the same number of pages as are used by Google, Yahoo, and MSN for their search engines.",
                "Because PageRank is a graph-based algorithm, it is important that it be run on as large a subset of the Web as possible.",
                "Most previous studies on PageRank used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g. the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages) We computed PageRank using the standard value of 0.85 for α.",
                "Popularity Another feature we used is the actual popularity of a Web page, measured as the number of times that it has been visited by users over some period of time.",
                "We have access to such data from users who have installed the MSN toolbar and have opted to provide it to MSN.",
                "The data is aggregated into a count, for each Web page, of the number of users who viewed that page.",
                "Though popularity data is generally unavailable, there are two other sources for it.",
                "The first is from proxy logs.",
                "For example, a university that requires its students to use a proxy has a record of all the pages they have visited while on campus.",
                "Unfortunately, proxy data is quite biased and relatively small.",
                "Another source, internal to search engines, are records of which results their users clicked on.",
                "Such data was used by the search engine Direct Hit, and has recently been explored for dynamic ranking purposes [20].",
                "An advantage of the toolbar data over this is that it contains information about URL visits that are not just the result of a search.",
                "The raw popularity is processed into a number of features such as the number of times a page was viewed and the number of times any page in the domain was viewed.",
                "More details are provided in section 5.5.",
                "Anchor text and inlinks These features are based on the information associated with links to the page in question.",
                "It includes features such as the total amount of text in links pointing to the page (anchor text), the number of unique words in that text, etc.",
                "Page This category consists of features which may be determined by looking at the page (and its URL) alone.",
                "We used only eight, simple features such as the number of words in the body, the frequency of the most common term, etc.",
                "Domain This category contains features that are computed as averages across all pages in the domain.",
                "For example, the average number of outlinks on any page and the average PageRank.",
                "Many of these features have been used by others for ranking Web pages, particularly the anchor and page features.",
                "As mentioned, the evaluation is typically for dynamic ranking, and we wish to evaluate the use of them for static ranking.",
                "Also, to our knowledge, this is the first study on the use of actual page visitation popularity for static ranking.",
                "The closest similar work is on using click-through behavior (that is, which search engine results the users click on) to affect dynamic ranking (see e.g., [20]).",
                "Because we use a wide variety of features to come up with a static ranking, we refer to this as fRank (for feature-based ranking). fRank uses RankNet and the set of features described in this section to learn a ranking function for Web pages.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, fRank was trained with all of the features. 5.",
                "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we will demonstrate that we can out perform PageRank by applying machine learning to a straightforward set of features.",
                "Before the results, we first discuss the data, the performance metric, and the training method. 5.1 Data In order to evaluate the quality of a static ranking, we needed a gold standard defining the correct ordering for a set of pages.",
                "For this, we employed a dataset which contains human judgments for 28000 queries.",
                "For each query, a number of results are manually assigned a rating, from 0 to 4, by human judges.",
                "The rating is meant to be a measure of how relevant the result is for the query, where 0 means poor and 4 means excellent.",
                "There are approximately 500k judgments in all, or an average of 18 ratings per query.",
                "The queries are selected by randomly choosing queries from among those issued to the MSN search engine.",
                "The probability that a query is selected is proportional to its frequency among all 709 of the queries.",
                "As a result, common queries are more likely to be judged than uncommon queries.",
                "As an example of how diverse the queries are, the first four queries in the training set are chef schools, chicagoland speedway, eagles fan club, and Turkish culture.",
                "The documents selected for judging are those that we expected would, on average, be reasonably relevant (for example, the top ten documents returned by MSNs search engine).",
                "This provides significantly more information than randomly selecting documents on the Web, the vast majority of which would be irrelevant to a given query.",
                "Because of this process, the judged pages tend to be of higher quality than the average page on the Web, and tend to be pages that will be returned for common search queries.",
                "This bias is good when evaluating the quality of static ranking for the purposes of index ordering and returning relevant documents.",
                "This is because the most important portion of the index to be well-ordered and relevant is the portion that is frequently returned for search queries.",
                "Because of this bias, however, the results in this paper are not applicable to crawl prioritization.",
                "In order to obtain experimental results on crawl prioritization, we would need ratings on a random sample of Web pages.",
                "To convert the data from query-dependent to query-independent, we simply removed the query, taking the maximum over judgments for a URL that appears in more than one query.",
                "The reasoning behind this is that a page that is relevant for some query and irrelevant for another is probably a decent page and should have a high static rank.",
                "Because we evaluated the pages on queries that occur frequently, our data indicates the correct index ordering, and assigns high value to pages that are likely to be relevant to a common query.",
                "We randomly assigned queries to a training, validation, or test set, such that they contained 84%, 8%, and 8% of the queries, respectively.",
                "Each set contains all of the ratings for a given query, and no query appears in more than one set.",
                "The training set was used to train fRank.",
                "The validation set was used to select the model that had the highest performance.",
                "The test set was used for the final results.",
                "This data gives us a query-independent ordering of pages.",
                "The goal for a static ranking algorithm will be to reproduce this ordering as closely as possible.",
                "In the next section, we describe the measure we used to evaluate this. 5.2 Measure We chose to use pairwise accuracy to evaluate the quality of a static ranking.",
                "The pairwise accuracy is the fraction of time that the ranking algorithm and human judges agree on the ordering of a pair of Web pages.",
                "If S(x) is the static ranking assigned to page x, and H(x) is the human judgment of relevance for x, then consider the following sets: )}()(:,{ yHxHyx >=pH and )}()(:,{ ySxSyx >=pS The pairwise accuracy is the portion of Hp that is also contained in Sp: p pp H SH ∩ =accuracypairwise This measure was chosen for two reasons.",
                "First, the discrete human judgments provide only a partial ordering over Web pages, making it difficult to apply a measure such as the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (in the pairwise accuracy measure, a pair of documents with the same human judgment does not affect the score).",
                "Second, the pairwise accuracy has an intuitive meaning: it is the fraction of pairs of documents that, when the humans claim one is better than the other, the static rank algorithm orders them correctly. 5.3 Method We trained fRank (a RankNet based neural network) using the following parameters.",
                "We used a fully connected 2 layer network.",
                "The hidden layer had 10 hidden nodes.",
                "The input weights to this layer were all initialized to be zero.",
                "The output layer (just a single node) weights were initialized using a uniform random distribution in the range [-0.1, 0.1].",
                "We used tanh as the transfer function from the inputs to the hidden layer, and a linear function from the hidden layer to the output.",
                "The cost function is the pairwise cross entropy cost function as discussed in section 3.",
                "The features in the training set were normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.",
                "The same linear transformation was then applied to the features in the validation and test sets.",
                "For training, we presented the network with 5 million pairings of pages, where one page had a higher rating than the other.",
                "The pairings were chosen uniformly at random (with replacement) from all possible pairings.",
                "When forming the pairs, we ignored the magnitude of the difference between the ratings (the rating spread) for the two URLs.",
                "Hence, the weight for each pair was constant (one), and the probability of a pair being selected was independent of its rating spread.",
                "We trained the network for 30 epochs.",
                "On each epoch, the training pairs were randomly shuffled.",
                "The initial training rate was 0.001.",
                "At each epoch, we checked the error on the training set.",

                "The training rate at each epoch was thus set to: Training rate = 1+ε κ Where κ is the initial rate (0.001), and ε is the number of times the training set error has increased.",
                "After each epoch, we measured the performance of the neural network on the validation set, using 1 million pairs (chosen randomly with replacement).",
                "The network with the highest pairwise accuracy on the validation set was selected, and then tested on the test set.",
                "We report the pairwise accuracy on the test set, calculated using all possible pairs.",

                "In particular, the choice of initial training rate, number of epochs, and training rate decay function were taken directly from Burges et al [7].",
                "Though we had the option of preprocessing any of the features before they were input to the neural network, we refrained from doing so on most of them.",

                "To reduce the dynamic range, and hopefully make the feature more useful, we presented the network with both the unpreprocessed, as well as the logarithm, of the popularity features (As with the others, the logarithmic feature values were also normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation). 710 Applying fRank to a document is computationally efficient, taking time that is only linear in the number of input features; it is thus within a constant factor of other simple machine learning methods such as naïve Bayes.",
                "In our experiments, computing the fRank for all five billion Web pages was approximately 100 times faster than computing the PageRank for the same set. 5.4 Results As Table 1 shows, fRank significantly outperforms PageRank for the purposes of static ranking.",
                "With a pairwise accuracy of 67.4%, fRank more than doubles the accuracy of PageRank (relative to the baseline of 50%, which is the accuracy that would be achieved by a random ordering of Web pages).",
                "Note that one of fRanks input features is the PageRank of the page, so we would expect it to perform no worse than PageRank.",
                "The significant increase in accuracy implies that the other features (anchor, popularity, etc.) do in fact contain useful information regarding the overall quality of a page.",

                "We thus concluded that the quality of the PageRank is not sensitive to these minor variations in algorithm, nor was PageRanks low accuracy due to problems with our implementation of it.",

                "The toolbar provides information about which Web pages people find interesting right now, whereas links are added to pages more slowly, as authors find the time and interest. 6.",
                "RELATED AND FUTURE WORK 6.1 Improvements to PageRank Since the original PageRank paper, there has been work on improving it.",

                "One recognized problem with PageRank is that of topic drift: A page about dogs will have high PageRank if it is linked to by many pages that themselves have high rank, regardless of their topic.",
                "In contrast, a search engine user looking for good pages about dogs would likely prefer to find pages that are pointed to by many pages that are themselves about dogs.",
                "Hence, a link that is on topic should have higher weight than a link that is not.",
                "Richardson and Domingoss Query Dependent PageRank [29] and Haveliwalas Topic-Sensitive PageRank [16] are two approaches that tackle this problem.",
                "Other variations to PageRank include differently weighting links for inter- vs. intra-domain links, adding a backwards step to the random surfer to simulate the back button on most browsers [24] and modifying the jump probability (α) [3].",
                "See Langville and Meyer [23] for a good survey of these, and other modifications to PageRank. 6.2 Other related work PageRank is not the only link analysis algorithm used for ranking Web pages.",

                "Previous work has shown HITS to perform comparably to PageRank [1].",
                "One field of interest is that of static index pruning (see e.g., Carmel et al. [8]).",
                "Static index pruning methods reduce the size of the search engines index by removing documents that are unlikely to be returned by a search query.",
                "The pruning is typically done based on the frequency of query terms.",

                "They argue that pages with high PageRank are more likely to be found by Web users, thus more likely to be linked to, and thus more likely to maintain a higher PageRank than other pages.",

                "Other work, such as Boyan et al. [4] and Bartell et al. [2] apply machine learning for the purposes of improving the overall relevance of a search engine (i.e., the dynamic ranking).",
                "They do not apply their techniques to the problem of static ranking. 6.3 Future work There are many ways in which we would like to extend this work.",
                "First, fRank uses only a small number of features.",
                "We believe we could achieve even more significant results with more features.",
                "In particular the existence, or lack thereof, of certain words could prove very significant (for instance, under construction probably signifies a low quality page).",
                "Other features could include the number of images on a page, size of those images, number of layout elements (tables, divs, and spans), use of style sheets, conforming to W3C standards (like XHTML 1.0 Strict), background color of a page, etc.",
                "Many pages are generated dynamically, the contents of which may depend on parameters in the URL, the time of day, the user visiting the site, or other variables.",
                "For such pages, it may be useful to apply the techniques found in [26] to form a static approximation for the purposes of extracting features.",
                "The resulting grammar describing the page could itself be a source of additional features describing the complexity of the page, such as how many non-terminal nodes it has, the depth of the grammar tree, etc. fRank allows one to specify a confidence in each pairing of documents.",
                "In the future, we will experiment with probabilities that depend on the difference in human judgments between the two items in the pair.",
                "For example, a pair of documents where one was rated 4 and the other 0 should have a higher confidence than a pair of documents rated 3 and 2.",
                "The experiments in this paper are biased toward pages that have higher than average quality.",
                "Also, fRank with all of the features can only be applied to pages that have already been crawled.",
                "Thus, fRank is primarily useful for index ordering and improving relevance, not for directing the crawl.",
                "We would like to investigate a machine learning approach for crawl prioritization as well.",
                "It may be that a combination of methods is best: for example, using PageRank to select the best 5 billion of the 20 billion pages on the Web, then using fRank to order the index and affect search relevancy.",
                "Another interesting direction for exploration is to incorporate fRank and page-level features directly into the PageRank computation itself.",
                "Work on biasing the PageRank jump vector [16], and transition matrix [29], have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of such an approach.",
                "There is reason to believe that a direct application of [29], using the fRank of a page for its relevance, could lead to an improved overall static rank.",
                "Finally, the popularity data can be used in other interesting ways.",
                "The general surfing and searching habits of Web users varies by time of day.",
                "Activity in the morning, daytime, and evening are often quite different (e.g., reading the news, solving problems, and accessing entertainment, respectively).",
                "We can gain insight into these differences by using the popularity data, divided into segments of the day.",
                "When a query is issued, we would then use the popularity data matching the time of query in order to do the ranking of Web pages.",
                "We also plan to explore popularity features that use more than just the counts of how often a page was visited.",
                "For example, how long users tended to dwell on a page, did they leave the page by clicking a link or by hitting the back button, etc.",
                "Fox et al. did a study that showed that features such as this can be valuable for the purposes of dynamic ranking [14].",
                "Finally, the popularity data could be used as the label rather than as a feature.",
                "Using fRank in this way to predict the popularity of a page may useful for the tasks of relevance, efficiency, and crawl priority.",
                "There is also significantly more popularity data than human labeled data, potentially enabling more complex machine learning methods, and significantly more features. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS A good static ranking is an important component for todays search engines and <br>information retrieval</br> systems.",
                "We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank.",
                "By combining many static features, fRank achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise accuracy than PageRank alone.",
                "A qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that Web users, rather than Web authors, visit.",
                "The machine learning component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further developments in the machine learning community in areas such as adversarial classification.",
                "We have only begun to explore the options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the area of static ranking by further experimentation with additional features, other machine learning techniques, and additional sources of data. 8.",

                "INTRODUCTION Over the past decade, the Web has grown exponentially in size.",
                "Unfortunately, this growth has not been isolated to good-quality pages.",
                "The number of incorrect, spamming, and malicious (e.g., phishing) sites has also grown rapidly.",
                "The sheer number of both good and bad pages on the Web has led to an increasing reliance on search engines for the discovery of useful information.",
                "Users rely on search engines not only to return pages related to their search query, but also to separate the good from the bad, and order results so that the best pages are suggested first.",
                "To date, most work on Web page ranking has focused on improving the ordering of the results returned to the user (querydependent ranking, or dynamic ranking).",
                "However, having a good query-independent ranking (static ranking) is also crucially important for a search engine.",
                "A good static ranking algorithm provides numerous benefits: • Relevance: The static rank of a page provides a general indicator to the overall quality of the page.",
                "This is a useful input to the dynamic ranking algorithm. • Efficiency: Typically, the search engines index is ordered by static rank.",
                "By traversing the index from highquality to low-quality pages, the dynamic ranker may abort the search when it determines that no later page will have as high of a dynamic rank as those already found.",
                "The more accurate the static rank, the better this early-stopping ability, and hence the quicker the search engine may respond to queries. • Crawl Priority: The Web grows and changes as quickly as search engines can crawl it.",
                "Search engines need a way to prioritize their crawl-to determine which pages to recrawl, how frequently, and how often to seek out new pages.",
                "Among other factors, the static rank of a page is used to determine this prioritization.",
                "A better static rank thus provides the engine with a higher quality, more upto-date index.",
                "Google is often regarded as the first commercially successful search engine.",
                "Their ranking was originally based on the PageRank algorithm [5][27].",
                "Due to this (and possibly due to Googles promotion of PageRank to the public), PageRank is widely regarded as the best method for the static ranking of Web pages.",
                "Though PageRank has historically been thought to perform quite well, there has yet been little academic evidence to support this claim.",
                "Even worse, there has recently been work showing that PageRank may not perform any better than other simple measures on certain tasks.",
                "Upstill et al. have found that for the task of finding home pages, the number of pages linking to a page and the type of URL were as, or more, effective than PageRank [32].",
                "They found similar results for the task of finding high quality companies [31].",
                "PageRank has also been used in systems for TRECs very large collection and Web track competitions, but with much less success than had been expected [17].",
                "Finally, Amento et al. [1] found that simple features, such as the number of pages on a site, performed as well as PageRank.",
                "Despite these, the general belief remains among many, both academic and in the public, that PageRank is an essential factor for a good static rank.",
                "Failing this, it is still assumed that using the link structure is crucial, in the form of the number of inlinks or the amount of anchor text.",
                "In this paper, we show there are a number of simple url- or pagebased features that significantly outperform PageRank (for the purposes of statically ranking Web pages) despite ignoring the structure of the Web.",
                "We combine these and other static features using machine learning to achieve a ranking system that is significantly better than PageRank (in pairwise agreement with human labels).",
                "A machine learning approach for static ranking has other advantages besides the quality of the ranking.",
                "Because the measure consists of many features, it is harder for malicious users to manipulate it (i.e., to raise their pages static rank to an undeserved level through questionable techniques, also known as Web spamming).",
                "This is particularly true if the feature set is not known.",
                "In contrast, a single measure like PageRank can be easier to manipulate because spammers need only concentrate on one goal: how to cause more pages to point to their page.",
                "With an algorithm that learns, a feature that becomes unusable due to spammer manipulation will simply be reduced or removed from the final computation of rank.",
                "This flexibility allows a ranking system to rapidly react to new spamming techniques.",
                "A machine learning approach to static ranking is also able to take advantage of any advances in the machine learning field.",
                "For example, recent work on adversarial classification [12] suggests that it may be possible to explicitly model the Web page spammers (the adversary) actions, adjusting the ranking model in advance of the spammers attempts to circumvent it.",
                "Another example is the elimination of outliers in constructing the model, which helps reduce the effect that unique sites may have on the overall quality of the static rank.",
                "By moving static ranking to a machine learning framework, we not only gain in accuracy, but also gain in the ability to react to spammers actions, to rapidly add new features to the ranking algorithm, and to leverage advances in the rapidly growing field of machine learning.",
                "Finally, we believe there will be significant advantages to using this technique for other domains, such as searching a local hard drive or a corporations intranet.",
                "These are domains where the link structure is particularly weak (or non-existent), but there are other domain-specific features that could be just as powerful.",
                "For example, the author of an intranet page and his/her position in the organization (e.g., CEO, manager, or developer) could provide significant clues as to the importance of that page.",
                "A machine learning approach thus allows rapid development of a good static algorithm in new domains.",
                "This papers contribution is a systematic study of static features, including PageRank, for the purposes of (statically) ranking Web pages.",
                "Previous studies on PageRank typically used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g., the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages).",
                "Also, the performance of PageRank and other static features has typically been evaluated in the context of a complete system for dynamic ranking, or for other tasks such as question answering.",
                "In contrast, we explore the use of PageRank and other features for the direct task of statically ranking Web pages.",
                "We first briefly describe the PageRank algorithm.",
                "In Section 3 we introduce RankNet, the machine learning technique used to combine static features into a final ranking.",
                "Section 4 describes the static features.",
                "The heart of the paper is in Section 5, which presents our experiments and results.",
                "We conclude with a discussion of related and future work. 2.",
                "PAGERANK The basic idea behind PageRank is simple: a link from a Web page to another can be seen as an endorsement of that page.",
                "In general, links are made by people.",
                "As such, they are indicative of the quality of the pages to which they point - when creating a page, an author presumably chooses to link to pages deemed to be of good quality.",
                "We can take advantage of this linkage information to order Web pages according to their perceived quality.",
                "Imagine a Web surfer who jumps from Web page to Web page, choosing with uniform probability which link to follow at each step.",
                "In order to reduce the effect of dead-ends or endless cycles the surfer will occasionally jump to a random page with some small probability α, or when on a page with no out-links.",
                "If averaged over a sufficient number of steps, the probability the surfer is on page j at some point in time is given by the formula: ∑∈ + − = ji i iP N jP B F )()1( )( α α (1) Where Fi is the set of pages that page i links to, and Bj is the set of pages that link to page j.",
                "The PageRank score for node j is defined as this probability: PR(j)=P(j).",
                "Because equation (1) is recursive, it must be iteratively evaluated until P(j) converges (typically, the initial distribution for P(j) is uniform).",
                "The intuition is, because a random surfer would end up at the page more frequently, it is likely a better page.",
                "An alternative view for equation (1) is that each page is assigned a quality, P(j).",

                "It requires large amounts of memory (or very smart caching schemes that slow the computation down even further), and if spread across multiple machines, requires significant communication between them.",
                "Though much work has been done on optimizing the PageRank computation (see e.g., [25] and [6]), it remains a relatively slow, computationally expensive property to compute. 3.",

                "Because PageRank is a graph-based algorithm, it is important that it be run on as large a subset of the Web as possible.",
                "Most previous studies on PageRank used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g. the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages) We computed PageRank using the standard value of 0.85 for α.",
                "Popularity Another feature we used is the actual popularity of a Web page, measured as the number of times that it has been visited by users over some period of time.",
                "We have access to such data from users who have installed the MSN toolbar and have opted to provide it to MSN.",
                "The data is aggregated into a count, for each Web page, of the number of users who viewed that page.",
                "Though popularity data is generally unavailable, there are two other sources for it.",
                "The first is from proxy logs.",
                "For example, a university that requires its students to use a proxy has a record of all the pages they have visited while on campus.",
                "Unfortunately, proxy data is quite biased and relatively small.",
                "Another source, internal to search engines, are records of which results their users clicked on.",
                "Such data was used by the search engine Direct Hit, and has recently been explored for dynamic ranking purposes [20].",
                "An advantage of the toolbar data over this is that it contains information about URL visits that are not just the result of a search.",
                "The raw popularity is processed into a number of features such as the number of times a page was viewed and the number of times any page in the domain was viewed.",
                "More details are provided in section 5.5.",
                "Anchor text and inlinks These features are based on the information associated with links to the page in question.",
                "It includes features such as the total amount of text in links pointing to the page (anchor text), the number of unique words in that text, etc.",
                "Page This category consists of features which may be determined by looking at the page (and its URL) alone.",
                "We used only eight, simple features such as the number of words in the body, the frequency of the most common term, etc.",
                "Domain This category contains features that are computed as averages across all pages in the domain.",
                "For example, the average number of outlinks on any page and the average PageRank.",
                "Many of these features have been used by others for ranking Web pages, particularly the anchor and page features.",
                "As mentioned, the evaluation is typically for dynamic ranking, and we wish to evaluate the use of them for static ranking.",
                "Also, to our knowledge, this is the first study on the use of actual page visitation popularity for static ranking.",
                "The closest similar work is on using click-through behavior (that is, which search engine results the users click on) to affect dynamic ranking (see e.g., [20]).",
                "Because we use a wide variety of features to come up with a static ranking, we refer to this as fRank (for <br>feature-based ranking</br>). fRank uses RankNet and the set of features described in this section to learn a ranking function for Web pages.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, fRank was trained with all of the features. 5.",
                "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we will demonstrate that we can out perform PageRank by applying machine learning to a straightforward set of features.",
                "Before the results, we first discuss the data, the performance metric, and the training method. 5.1 Data In order to evaluate the quality of a static ranking, we needed a gold standard defining the correct ordering for a set of pages.",
                "For this, we employed a dataset which contains human judgments for 28000 queries.",
                "For each query, a number of results are manually assigned a rating, from 0 to 4, by human judges.",
                "The rating is meant to be a measure of how relevant the result is for the query, where 0 means poor and 4 means excellent.",
                "There are approximately 500k judgments in all, or an average of 18 ratings per query.",
                "The queries are selected by randomly choosing queries from among those issued to the MSN search engine.",
                "The probability that a query is selected is proportional to its frequency among all 709 of the queries.",
                "As a result, common queries are more likely to be judged than uncommon queries.",
                "As an example of how diverse the queries are, the first four queries in the training set are chef schools, chicagoland speedway, eagles fan club, and Turkish culture.",
                "The documents selected for judging are those that we expected would, on average, be reasonably relevant (for example, the top ten documents returned by MSNs search engine).",
                "This provides significantly more information than randomly selecting documents on the Web, the vast majority of which would be irrelevant to a given query.",
                "Because of this process, the judged pages tend to be of higher quality than the average page on the Web, and tend to be pages that will be returned for common search queries.",
                "This bias is good when evaluating the quality of static ranking for the purposes of index ordering and returning relevant documents.",
                "This is because the most important portion of the index to be well-ordered and relevant is the portion that is frequently returned for search queries.",
                "Because of this bias, however, the results in this paper are not applicable to crawl prioritization.",
                "In order to obtain experimental results on crawl prioritization, we would need ratings on a random sample of Web pages.",
                "To convert the data from query-dependent to query-independent, we simply removed the query, taking the maximum over judgments for a URL that appears in more than one query.",
                "The reasoning behind this is that a page that is relevant for some query and irrelevant for another is probably a decent page and should have a high static rank.",
                "Because we evaluated the pages on queries that occur frequently, our data indicates the correct index ordering, and assigns high value to pages that are likely to be relevant to a common query.",
                "We randomly assigned queries to a training, validation, or test set, such that they contained 84%, 8%, and 8% of the queries, respectively.",
                "Each set contains all of the ratings for a given query, and no query appears in more than one set.",
                "The training set was used to train fRank.",
                "The validation set was used to select the model that had the highest performance.",
                "The test set was used for the final results.",
                "This data gives us a query-independent ordering of pages.",
                "The goal for a static ranking algorithm will be to reproduce this ordering as closely as possible.",
                "In the next section, we describe the measure we used to evaluate this. 5.2 Measure We chose to use pairwise accuracy to evaluate the quality of a static ranking.",
                "The pairwise accuracy is the fraction of time that the ranking algorithm and human judges agree on the ordering of a pair of Web pages.",
                "If S(x) is the static ranking assigned to page x, and H(x) is the human judgment of relevance for x, then consider the following sets: )}()(:,{ yHxHyx >=pH and )}()(:,{ ySxSyx >=pS The pairwise accuracy is the portion of Hp that is also contained in Sp: p pp H SH ∩ =accuracypairwise This measure was chosen for two reasons.",
                "First, the discrete human judgments provide only a partial ordering over Web pages, making it difficult to apply a measure such as the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (in the pairwise accuracy measure, a pair of documents with the same human judgment does not affect the score).",
                "Second, the pairwise accuracy has an intuitive meaning: it is the fraction of pairs of documents that, when the humans claim one is better than the other, the static rank algorithm orders them correctly. 5.3 Method We trained fRank (a RankNet based neural network) using the following parameters.",
                "We used a fully connected 2 layer network.",
                "The hidden layer had 10 hidden nodes.",
                "The input weights to this layer were all initialized to be zero.",
                "The output layer (just a single node) weights were initialized using a uniform random distribution in the range [-0.1, 0.1].",
                "We used tanh as the transfer function from the inputs to the hidden layer, and a linear function from the hidden layer to the output.",
                "The cost function is the pairwise cross entropy cost function as discussed in section 3.",
                "The features in the training set were normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.",
                "The same linear transformation was then applied to the features in the validation and test sets.",
                "For training, we presented the network with 5 million pairings of pages, where one page had a higher rating than the other.",
                "The pairings were chosen uniformly at random (with replacement) from all possible pairings.",
                "When forming the pairs, we ignored the magnitude of the difference between the ratings (the rating spread) for the two URLs.",
                "Hence, the weight for each pair was constant (one), and the probability of a pair being selected was independent of its rating spread.",
                "We trained the network for 30 epochs.",
                "On each epoch, the training pairs were randomly shuffled.",
                "The initial training rate was 0.001.",
                "At each epoch, we checked the error on the training set.",
                "If the error had increased, then we decreased the training rate, under the hypothesis that the network had probably overshot.",
                "The training rate at each epoch was thus set to: Training rate = 1+ε κ Where κ is the initial rate (0.001), and ε is the number of times the training set error has increased.",
                "After each epoch, we measured the performance of the neural network on the validation set, using 1 million pairs (chosen randomly with replacement).",
                "The network with the highest pairwise accuracy on the validation set was selected, and then tested on the test set.",
                "We report the pairwise accuracy on the test set, calculated using all possible pairs.",
                "These parameters were determined and fixed before the static rank experiments in this paper.",
                "In particular, the choice of initial training rate, number of epochs, and training rate decay function were taken directly from Burges et al [7].",
                "Though we had the option of preprocessing any of the features before they were input to the neural network, we refrained from doing so on most of them.",
                "The only exception was the popularity features.",
                "As with most Web phenomenon, we found that the distribution of site popularity is Zipfian.",
                "To reduce the dynamic range, and hopefully make the feature more useful, we presented the network with both the unpreprocessed, as well as the logarithm, of the popularity features (As with the others, the logarithmic feature values were also normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation). 710 Applying fRank to a document is computationally efficient, taking time that is only linear in the number of input features; it is thus within a constant factor of other simple machine learning methods such as naïve Bayes.",
                "In our experiments, computing the fRank for all five billion Web pages was approximately 100 times faster than computing the PageRank for the same set. 5.4 Results As Table 1 shows, fRank significantly outperforms PageRank for the purposes of static ranking.",
                "With a pairwise accuracy of 67.4%, fRank more than doubles the accuracy of PageRank (relative to the baseline of 50%, which is the accuracy that would be achieved by a random ordering of Web pages).",
                "Note that one of fRanks input features is the PageRank of the page, so we would expect it to perform no worse than PageRank.",
                "The significant increase in accuracy implies that the other features (anchor, popularity, etc.) do in fact contain useful information regarding the overall quality of a page.",
                "Table 1: Basic Results Technique Accuracy (%) None (Baseline) 50.00 PageRank 56.70 fRank 67.43 There are a number of decisions that go into the computation of PageRank, such as how to deal with pages that have no outlinks, the choice of α, numeric precision, convergence threshold, etc.",
                "We were able to obtain a computation of PageRank from a completely independent implementation (provided by Marc Najork) that varied somewhat in these parameters.",
                "It achieved a pairwise accuracy of 56.52%, nearly identical to that obtained by our implementation.",
                "We thus concluded that the quality of the PageRank is not sensitive to these minor variations in algorithm, nor was PageRanks low accuracy due to problems with our implementation of it.",
                "We also wanted to find how well each feature set performed.",
                "To answer this, for each feature set, we trained and tested fRank using only that set of features.",
                "The results are shown in Table 2.",
                "As can be seen, every single feature set individually outperformed PageRank on this test.",
                "Perhaps the most interesting result is that the Page-level features had the highest performance out of all the feature sets.",
                "This is surprising because these are features that do not depend on the overall graph structure of the Web, nor even on what pages point to a given page.",
                "This is contrary to the common belief that the Web graph structure is the key to finding a good static ranking of Web pages.",

                "This means that a particular feature that appears to have little value in isolation could actually be very important when used in combination with other features.",
                "To measure the final contribution of a feature set, in the context of all the other features, we performed an ablation study.",
                "That is, for each set of features, we trained a network to contain all of the features except that set.",

                "PageRanks bias toward technology can be explained through two processes.",

                "Consequently, PageRank ranks those pages highly.",
                "Though these pages are important, they are not as important as it may seem by looking at the link structure alone.",
                "One fix for this is to add information about the link to the PageRank computation, such as the size of the text, whether it was at the bottom of the page, etc.",
                "The other bias comes from the fact that the population of Web site authors is different than the population of Web users.",
                "Web authors tend to be technologically-oriented, and thus their linking behavior reflects those interests. fRank, by knowing the actual visitation popularity of a site (the popularity feature set), is able to eliminate some of that bias.",

                "They argue that pages with high PageRank are more likely to be found by Web users, thus more likely to be linked to, and thus more likely to maintain a higher PageRank than other pages.",
                "The same may occur for the popularity data.",
                "If we increase the ranking for popular pages, they are more likely to be clicked on, thus further increasing their popularity.",
                "Cho et al. [10] argue that a more appropriate measure of Web page quality would depend on not only the current link structure of the Web, but also on the change in that link structure.",
                "The same technique may be applicable to popularity data: the change in popularity of a page may be more informative than the absolute popularity.",
                "One interesting related work is that of Ivory and Hearst [19].",
                "Their goal was to build a model of Web sites that are considered high quality from the perspective of content, structure and navigation, visual design, functionality, interactivity, and overall experience.",
                "They used over 100 page level features, as well as features encompassing the performance and structure of the site.",

                "They do not apply their techniques to the problem of static ranking. 6.3 Future work There are many ways in which we would like to extend this work.",
                "First, fRank uses only a small number of features.",
                "We believe we could achieve even more significant results with more features.",
                "In particular the existence, or lack thereof, of certain words could prove very significant (for instance, under construction probably signifies a low quality page).",
                "Other features could include the number of images on a page, size of those images, number of layout elements (tables, divs, and spans), use of style sheets, conforming to W3C standards (like XHTML 1.0 Strict), background color of a page, etc.",
                "Many pages are generated dynamically, the contents of which may depend on parameters in the URL, the time of day, the user visiting the site, or other variables.",
                "For such pages, it may be useful to apply the techniques found in [26] to form a static approximation for the purposes of extracting features.",
                "The resulting grammar describing the page could itself be a source of additional features describing the complexity of the page, such as how many non-terminal nodes it has, the depth of the grammar tree, etc. fRank allows one to specify a confidence in each pairing of documents.",
                "In the future, we will experiment with probabilities that depend on the difference in human judgments between the two items in the pair.",
                "For example, a pair of documents where one was rated 4 and the other 0 should have a higher confidence than a pair of documents rated 3 and 2.",
                "The experiments in this paper are biased toward pages that have higher than average quality.",
                "Also, fRank with all of the features can only be applied to pages that have already been crawled.",
                "Thus, fRank is primarily useful for index ordering and improving relevance, not for directing the crawl.",
                "We would like to investigate a machine learning approach for crawl prioritization as well.",
                "It may be that a combination of methods is best: for example, using PageRank to select the best 5 billion of the 20 billion pages on the Web, then using fRank to order the index and affect search relevancy.",
                "Another interesting direction for exploration is to incorporate fRank and page-level features directly into the PageRank computation itself.",
                "Work on biasing the PageRank jump vector [16], and transition matrix [29], have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of such an approach.",
                "There is reason to believe that a direct application of [29], using the fRank of a page for its relevance, could lead to an improved overall static rank.",
                "Finally, the popularity data can be used in other interesting ways.",
                "The general surfing and searching habits of Web users varies by time of day.",
                "Activity in the morning, daytime, and evening are often quite different (e.g., reading the news, solving problems, and accessing entertainment, respectively).",
                "We can gain insight into these differences by using the popularity data, divided into segments of the day.",
                "When a query is issued, we would then use the popularity data matching the time of query in order to do the ranking of Web pages.",
                "We also plan to explore popularity features that use more than just the counts of how often a page was visited.",
                "For example, how long users tended to dwell on a page, did they leave the page by clicking a link or by hitting the back button, etc.",
                "Fox et al. did a study that showed that features such as this can be valuable for the purposes of dynamic ranking [14].",
                "Finally, the popularity data could be used as the label rather than as a feature.",
                "Using fRank in this way to predict the popularity of a page may useful for the tasks of relevance, efficiency, and crawl priority.",
                "There is also significantly more popularity data than human labeled data, potentially enabling more complex machine learning methods, and significantly more features. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS A good static ranking is an important component for todays search engines and information retrieval systems.",
                "We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank.",
                "By combining many static features, fRank achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise accuracy than PageRank alone.",
                "A qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that Web users, rather than Web authors, visit.",
                "The machine learning component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further developments in the machine learning community in areas such as adversarial classification.",
                "We have only begun to explore the options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the area of static ranking by further experimentation with additional features, other machine learning techniques, and additional sources of data. 8.",

                "Unfortunately, this growth has not been isolated to good-quality pages.",
                "The number of incorrect, spamming, and malicious (e.g., phishing) sites has also grown rapidly.",
                "The sheer number of both good and bad pages on the Web has led to an increasing reliance on search engines for the discovery of useful information.",
                "Users rely on search engines not only to return pages related to their search query, but also to separate the good from the bad, and order results so that the best pages are suggested first.",
                "To date, most work on Web page ranking has focused on improving the ordering of the results returned to the user (querydependent ranking, or dynamic ranking).",
                "However, having a good query-independent ranking (static ranking) is also crucially important for a search engine.",
                "A good static ranking algorithm provides numerous benefits: • Relevance: The static rank of a page provides a general indicator to the overall quality of the page.",
                "This is a useful input to the dynamic ranking algorithm. • Efficiency: Typically, the search engines index is ordered by static rank.",
                "By traversing the index from highquality to low-quality pages, the dynamic ranker may abort the search when it determines that no later page will have as high of a dynamic rank as those already found.",
                "The more accurate the static rank, the better this early-stopping ability, and hence the quicker the search engine may respond to queries. • Crawl Priority: The Web grows and changes as quickly as search engines can crawl it.",
                "Search engines need a way to prioritize their crawl-to determine which pages to recrawl, how frequently, and how often to seek out new pages.",
                "Among other factors, the static rank of a page is used to determine this prioritization.",
                "A better static rank thus provides the engine with a higher quality, more upto-date index.",

                "For this, we employed a dataset which contains human judgments for 28000 queries.",

                "The queries are selected by randomly choosing queries from among those issued to the MSN search engine.",
                "The probability that a query is selected is proportional to its frequency among all 709 of the queries.",
                "As a result, common queries are more likely to be judged than uncommon queries.",
                "As an example of how diverse the queries are, the first four queries in the training set are chef schools, chicagoland speedway, eagles fan club, and Turkish culture.",
                "The documents selected for judging are those that we expected would, on average, be reasonably relevant (for example, the top ten documents returned by MSNs search engine).",
                "This provides significantly more information than randomly selecting documents on the Web, the vast majority of which would be irrelevant to a given query.",
                "Because of this process, the judged pages tend to be of higher quality than the average page on the Web, and tend to be pages that will be returned for common search queries.",
                "This bias is good when evaluating the quality of static ranking for the purposes of index ordering and returning relevant documents.",
                "This is because the most important portion of the index to be well-ordered and relevant is the portion that is frequently returned for search queries.",
                "Because of this bias, however, the results in this paper are not applicable to crawl prioritization.",
                "In order to obtain experimental results on crawl prioritization, we would need ratings on a random sample of Web pages.",
                "To convert the data from query-dependent to query-independent, we simply removed the query, taking the maximum over judgments for a URL that appears in more than one query.",
                "The reasoning behind this is that a page that is relevant for some query and irrelevant for another is probably a decent page and should have a high static rank.",
                "Because we evaluated the pages on queries that occur frequently, our data indicates the correct index ordering, and assigns high value to pages that are likely to be relevant to a common query.",

                "In the next section, we describe the measure we used to evaluate this. 5.2 Measure We chose to use pairwise accuracy to evaluate the quality of a static ranking.",
                "The pairwise accuracy is the fraction of time that the ranking algorithm and human judges agree on the ordering of a pair of Web pages.",
                "If S(x) is the static ranking assigned to page x, and H(x) is the human judgment of relevance for x, then consider the following sets: )}()(:,{ yHxHyx >=pH and )}()(:,{ ySxSyx >=pS The pairwise accuracy is the portion of Hp that is also contained in Sp: p pp H SH ∩ =accuracypairwise This measure was chosen for two reasons.",
                "First, the discrete human judgments provide only a partial ordering over Web pages, making it difficult to apply a measure such as the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (in the pairwise accuracy measure, a pair of documents with the same human judgment does not affect the score).",
                "Second, the pairwise accuracy has an intuitive meaning: it is the fraction of pairs of documents that, when the humans claim one is better than the other, the static rank algorithm orders them correctly. 5.3 Method We trained fRank (a RankNet based neural network) using the following parameters.",
                "We used a fully connected 2 layer network.",
                "The hidden layer had 10 hidden nodes.",
                "The input weights to this layer were all initialized to be zero.",
                "The output layer (just a single node) weights were initialized using a uniform random distribution in the range [-0.1, 0.1].",
                "We used tanh as the transfer function from the inputs to the hidden layer, and a linear function from the hidden layer to the output.",
                "The cost function is the pairwise cross entropy cost function as discussed in section 3.",
                "The features in the training set were normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.",
                "The same linear transformation was then applied to the features in the validation and test sets.",
                "For training, we presented the network with 5 million pairings of pages, where one page had a higher rating than the other.",
                "The pairings were chosen uniformly at random (with replacement) from all possible pairings.",
                "When forming the pairs, we ignored the magnitude of the difference between the ratings (the rating spread) for the two URLs.",
                "Hence, the weight for each pair was constant (one), and the probability of a pair being selected was independent of its rating spread.",
                "We trained the network for 30 epochs.",
                "On each epoch, the training pairs were randomly shuffled.",
                "The initial training rate was 0.001.",
                "At each epoch, we checked the error on the training set.",
                "If the error had increased, then we decreased the training rate, under the hypothesis that the network had probably overshot.",
                "The training rate at each epoch was thus set to: Training rate = 1+ε κ Where κ is the initial rate (0.001), and ε is the number of times the training set error has increased.",
                "After each epoch, we measured the performance of the neural network on the validation set, using 1 million pairs (chosen randomly with replacement).",
                "The network with the highest pairwise accuracy on the validation set was selected, and then tested on the test set.",
                "We report the pairwise accuracy on the test set, calculated using all possible pairs.",
                "These parameters were determined and fixed before the static rank experiments in this paper.",
                "In particular, the choice of initial training rate, number of epochs, and training rate decay function were taken directly from Burges et al [7].",
                "Though we had the option of preprocessing any of the features before they were input to the neural network, we refrained from doing so on most of them.",
                "The only exception was the popularity features.",
                "As with most Web phenomenon, we found that the distribution of site popularity is Zipfian.",
                "To reduce the dynamic range, and hopefully make the feature more useful, we presented the network with both the unpreprocessed, as well as the logarithm, of the popularity features (As with the others, the logarithmic feature values were also normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation). 710 Applying fRank to a document is computationally efficient, taking time that is only linear in the number of input features; it is thus within a constant factor of other simple <br>machine learning</br> methods such as naïve Bayes.",
                "In our experiments, computing the fRank for all five billion Web pages was approximately 100 times faster than computing the PageRank for the same set. 5.4 Results As Table 1 shows, fRank significantly outperforms PageRank for the purposes of static ranking.",

                "Note that one of fRanks input features is the PageRank of the page, so we would expect it to perform no worse than PageRank.",
                "The significant increase in accuracy implies that the other features (anchor, popularity, etc.) do in fact contain useful information regarding the overall quality of a page.",
                "Table 1: Basic Results Technique Accuracy (%) None (Baseline) 50.00 PageRank 56.70 fRank 67.43 There are a number of decisions that go into the computation of PageRank, such as how to deal with pages that have no outlinks, the choice of α, numeric precision, convergence threshold, etc.",

                "It achieved a pairwise accuracy of 56.52%, nearly identical to that obtained by our implementation.",
                "We thus concluded that the quality of the PageRank is not sensitive to these minor variations in algorithm, nor was PageRanks low accuracy due to problems with our implementation of it.",
                "We also wanted to find how well each feature set performed.",
                "To answer this, for each feature set, we trained and tested fRank using only that set of features.",
                "The results are shown in Table 2.",
                "As can be seen, every single feature set individually outperformed PageRank on this test.",
                "Perhaps the most interesting result is that the Page-level features had the highest performance out of all the feature sets.",
                "This is surprising because these are features that do not depend on the overall graph structure of the Web, nor even on what pages point to a given page.",

                "PageRanks bias toward technology can be explained through two processes.",
                "First, there are many pages with buttons at the bottom suggesting that the site is optimized for Internet Explorer, or that the visitor needs QuickTime.",

                "Consequently, PageRank ranks those pages highly.",
                "Though these pages are important, they are not as important as it may seem by looking at the link structure alone.",
                "One fix for this is to add information about the link to the PageRank computation, such as the size of the text, whether it was at the bottom of the page, etc.",
                "The other bias comes from the fact that the population of Web site authors is different than the population of Web users.",
                "Web authors tend to be technologically-oriented, and thus their linking behavior reflects those interests. fRank, by knowing the actual visitation popularity of a site (the popularity feature set), is able to eliminate some of that bias.",
                "It has the ability to depend more on where actual Web users visit rather than where the Web site authors have linked.",
                "The results confirm that fRank outperforms PageRank in pairwise accuracy.",
                "The two most important feature sets are the page and popularity features.",

                "Gathering more popularity data, as well as employing simple backoff strategies, improve this boost even further. 5.6 Summary of Results The experiments provide a number of conclusions.",
                "First, fRank performs significantly better than PageRank, even without any information about the Web graph.",
                "Second, the page level and popularity features were the most significant contributors to pairwise accuracy.",
                "Third, by collecting more popularity data, we can continue to improve fRanks performance.",
                "The popularity data provides two benefits to fRank.",
                "First, we see that qualitatively, fRanks ordering of Web pages has a more favorable bias than PageRanks. fRanks ordering seems to correspond to what Web users, rather than Web page authors, prefer.",
                "Second, the popularity data is more timely than PageRanks link information.",
                "The toolbar provides information about which Web pages people find interesting right now, whereas links are added to pages more slowly, as authors find the time and interest. 6.",
                "RELATED AND FUTURE WORK 6.1 Improvements to PageRank Since the original PageRank paper, there has been work on improving it.",
                "Much of that work centers on speeding up and parallelizing the computation [15][25].",
                "One recognized problem with PageRank is that of topic drift: A page about dogs will have high PageRank if it is linked to by many pages that themselves have high rank, regardless of their topic.",
                "In contrast, a search engine user looking for good pages about dogs would likely prefer to find pages that are pointed to by many pages that are themselves about dogs.",
                "Hence, a link that is on topic should have higher weight than a link that is not.",
                "Richardson and Domingoss Query Dependent PageRank [29] and Haveliwalas Topic-Sensitive PageRank [16] are two approaches that tackle this problem.",
                "Other variations to PageRank include differently weighting links for inter- vs. intra-domain links, adding a backwards step to the random surfer to simulate the back button on most browsers [24] and modifying the jump probability (α) [3].",
                "See Langville and Meyer [23] for a good survey of these, and other modifications to PageRank. 6.2 Other related work PageRank is not the only link analysis algorithm used for ranking Web pages.",
                "The most well-known other is HITS [22], which is used by the Teoma search engine [30].",
                "HITS produces a list of hubs and authorities, where hubs are pages that point to many authority pages, and authorities are pages that are pointed to by many hubs.",
                "Previous work has shown HITS to perform comparably to PageRank [1].",
                "One field of interest is that of static index pruning (see e.g., Carmel et al. [8]).",
                "Static index pruning methods reduce the size of the search engines index by removing documents that are unlikely to be returned by a search query.",
                "The pruning is typically done based on the frequency of query terms.",
                "Similarly, Pandey and Olston [28] suggest crawling pages frequently if they are likely to incorrectly appear (or not appear) as a result of a search.",
                "Similar methods could be incorporated into the static rank (e.g., how many frequent queries contain words found on this page).",
                "Others have investigated the effect that PageRank has on the Web at large [9].",
                "They argue that pages with high PageRank are more likely to be found by Web users, thus more likely to be linked to, and thus more likely to maintain a higher PageRank than other pages.",
                "The same may occur for the popularity data.",
                "If we increase the ranking for popular pages, they are more likely to be clicked on, thus further increasing their popularity.",
                "Cho et al. [10] argue that a more appropriate measure of Web page quality would depend on not only the current link structure of the Web, but also on the change in that link structure.",
                "The same technique may be applicable to popularity data: the change in popularity of a page may be more informative than the absolute popularity.",
                "One interesting related work is that of Ivory and Hearst [19].",
                "Their goal was to build a model of Web sites that are considered high quality from the perspective of content, structure and navigation, visual design, functionality, interactivity, and overall experience.",

                "Other work, such as Boyan et al. [4] and Bartell et al. [2] apply <br>machine learning</br> for the purposes of improving the overall relevance of a search engine (i.e., the dynamic ranking).",
                "They do not apply their techniques to the problem of static ranking. 6.3 Future work There are many ways in which we would like to extend this work.",
                "First, fRank uses only a small number of features.",
                "We believe we could achieve even more significant results with more features.",
                "In particular the existence, or lack thereof, of certain words could prove very significant (for instance, under construction probably signifies a low quality page).",
                "Other features could include the number of images on a page, size of those images, number of layout elements (tables, divs, and spans), use of style sheets, conforming to W3C standards (like XHTML 1.0 Strict), background color of a page, etc.",
                "Many pages are generated dynamically, the contents of which may depend on parameters in the URL, the time of day, the user visiting the site, or other variables.",
                "For such pages, it may be useful to apply the techniques found in [26] to form a static approximation for the purposes of extracting features.",
                "The resulting grammar describing the page could itself be a source of additional features describing the complexity of the page, such as how many non-terminal nodes it has, the depth of the grammar tree, etc. fRank allows one to specify a confidence in each pairing of documents.",
                "In the future, we will experiment with probabilities that depend on the difference in human judgments between the two items in the pair.",
                "For example, a pair of documents where one was rated 4 and the other 0 should have a higher confidence than a pair of documents rated 3 and 2.",
                "The experiments in this paper are biased toward pages that have higher than average quality.",
                "Also, fRank with all of the features can only be applied to pages that have already been crawled.",
                "Thus, fRank is primarily useful for index ordering and improving relevance, not for directing the crawl.",
                "We would like to investigate a <br>machine learning</br> approach for crawl prioritization as well.",
                "It may be that a combination of methods is best: for example, using PageRank to select the best 5 billion of the 20 billion pages on the Web, then using fRank to order the index and affect search relevancy.",
                "Another interesting direction for exploration is to incorporate fRank and page-level features directly into the PageRank computation itself.",
                "Work on biasing the PageRank jump vector [16], and transition matrix [29], have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of such an approach.",
                "There is reason to believe that a direct application of [29], using the fRank of a page for its relevance, could lead to an improved overall static rank.",
                "Finally, the popularity data can be used in other interesting ways.",
                "The general surfing and searching habits of Web users varies by time of day.",
                "Activity in the morning, daytime, and evening are often quite different (e.g., reading the news, solving problems, and accessing entertainment, respectively).",
                "We can gain insight into these differences by using the popularity data, divided into segments of the day.",
                "When a query is issued, we would then use the popularity data matching the time of query in order to do the ranking of Web pages.",
                "We also plan to explore popularity features that use more than just the counts of how often a page was visited.",
                "For example, how long users tended to dwell on a page, did they leave the page by clicking a link or by hitting the back button, etc.",
                "Fox et al. did a study that showed that features such as this can be valuable for the purposes of dynamic ranking [14].",
                "Finally, the popularity data could be used as the label rather than as a feature.",
                "Using fRank in this way to predict the popularity of a page may useful for the tasks of relevance, efficiency, and crawl priority.",
                "There is also significantly more popularity data than human labeled data, potentially enabling more complex <br>machine learning</br> methods, and significantly more features. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS A good static ranking is an important component for todays search engines and information retrieval systems.",
                "We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank.",
                "By combining many static features, fRank achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise accuracy than PageRank alone.",
                "A qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that Web users, rather than Web authors, visit.",
                "The <br>machine learning</br> component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further developments in the <br>machine learning</br> community in areas such as adversarial classification.",
                "We have only begun to explore the options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the area of static ranking by further experimentation with additional features, other <br>machine learning</br> techniques, and additional sources of data. 8.",

                "INTRODUCTION Over the past decade, the Web has grown exponentially in size.",
                "Unfortunately, this growth has not been isolated to good-quality pages.",
                "The number of incorrect, spamming, and malicious (e.g., phishing) sites has also grown rapidly.",
                "The sheer number of both good and bad pages on the Web has led to an increasing reliance on search engines for the discovery of useful information.",
                "Users rely on search engines not only to return pages related to their search query, but also to separate the good from the bad, and order results so that the best pages are suggested first.",
                "To date, most work on Web page ranking has focused on improving the ordering of the results returned to the user (querydependent ranking, or dynamic ranking).",
                "However, having a good query-independent ranking (static ranking) is also crucially important for a search engine.",
                "A good static ranking algorithm provides numerous benefits: • Relevance: The static rank of a page provides a general indicator to the overall quality of the page.",
                "This is a useful input to the dynamic ranking algorithm. • Efficiency: Typically, the search engines index is ordered by static rank.",
                "By traversing the index from highquality to low-quality pages, the dynamic ranker may abort the search when it determines that no later page will have as high of a dynamic rank as those already found.",
                "The more accurate the static rank, the better this early-stopping ability, and hence the quicker the search engine may respond to queries. • Crawl Priority: The Web grows and changes as quickly as search engines can crawl it.",
                "Search engines need a way to prioritize their crawl-to determine which pages to recrawl, how frequently, and how often to seek out new pages.",
                "Among other factors, the static rank of a page is used to determine this prioritization.",
                "A better static rank thus provides the engine with a higher quality, more upto-date index.",
                "Google is often regarded as the first commercially successful search engine.",
                "Their ranking was originally based on the PageRank algorithm [5][27].",
                "Due to this (and possibly due to Googles promotion of PageRank to the public), PageRank is widely regarded as the best method for the static ranking of Web pages.",
                "Though PageRank has historically been thought to perform quite well, there has yet been little academic evidence to support this claim.",
                "Even worse, there has recently been work showing that PageRank may not perform any better than other simple measures on certain tasks.",
                "Upstill et al. have found that for the task of finding home pages, the number of pages linking to a page and the type of URL were as, or more, effective than PageRank [32].",
                "They found similar results for the task of finding high quality companies [31].",
                "PageRank has also been used in systems for TRECs very large collection and Web track competitions, but with much less success than had been expected [17].",
                "Finally, Amento et al. [1] found that simple features, such as the number of pages on a site, performed as well as PageRank.",
                "Despite these, the general belief remains among many, both academic and in the public, that PageRank is an essential factor for a good static rank.",
                "Failing this, it is still assumed that using the link structure is crucial, in the form of the number of inlinks or the amount of anchor text.",
                "In this paper, we show there are a number of simple url- or pagebased features that significantly outperform PageRank (for the purposes of statically ranking Web pages) despite ignoring the structure of the Web.",
                "We combine these and other static features using machine learning to achieve a ranking system that is significantly better than PageRank (in pairwise agreement with human labels).",
                "A machine learning approach for static ranking has other advantages besides the quality of the ranking.",
                "Because the measure consists of many features, it is harder for malicious users to manipulate it (i.e., to raise their pages static rank to an undeserved level through questionable techniques, also known as Web spamming).",
                "This is particularly true if the feature set is not known.",
                "In contrast, a single measure like PageRank can be easier to manipulate because spammers need only concentrate on one goal: how to cause more pages to point to their page.",
                "With an algorithm that learns, a feature that becomes unusable due to spammer manipulation will simply be reduced or removed from the final computation of rank.",
                "This flexibility allows a ranking system to rapidly react to new spamming techniques.",
                "A machine learning approach to static ranking is also able to take advantage of any advances in the machine learning field.",
                "For example, recent work on <br>adversarial classification</br> [12] suggests that it may be possible to explicitly model the Web page spammers (the adversary) actions, adjusting the ranking model in advance of the spammers attempts to circumvent it.",
                "Another example is the elimination of outliers in constructing the model, which helps reduce the effect that unique sites may have on the overall quality of the static rank.",
                "By moving static ranking to a machine learning framework, we not only gain in accuracy, but also gain in the ability to react to spammers actions, to rapidly add new features to the ranking algorithm, and to leverage advances in the rapidly growing field of machine learning.",
                "Finally, we believe there will be significant advantages to using this technique for other domains, such as searching a local hard drive or a corporations intranet.",
                "These are domains where the link structure is particularly weak (or non-existent), but there are other domain-specific features that could be just as powerful.",
                "For example, the author of an intranet page and his/her position in the organization (e.g., CEO, manager, or developer) could provide significant clues as to the importance of that page.",
                "A machine learning approach thus allows rapid development of a good static algorithm in new domains.",
                "This papers contribution is a systematic study of static features, including PageRank, for the purposes of (statically) ranking Web pages.",
                "Previous studies on PageRank typically used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g., the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages).",
                "Also, the performance of PageRank and other static features has typically been evaluated in the context of a complete system for dynamic ranking, or for other tasks such as question answering.",
                "In contrast, we explore the use of PageRank and other features for the direct task of statically ranking Web pages.",
                "We first briefly describe the PageRank algorithm.",
                "In Section 3 we introduce RankNet, the machine learning technique used to combine static features into a final ranking.",
                "Section 4 describes the static features.",
                "The heart of the paper is in Section 5, which presents our experiments and results.",
                "We conclude with a discussion of related and future work. 2.",
                "PAGERANK The basic idea behind PageRank is simple: a link from a Web page to another can be seen as an endorsement of that page.",
                "In general, links are made by people.",
                "As such, they are indicative of the quality of the pages to which they point - when creating a page, an author presumably chooses to link to pages deemed to be of good quality.",
                "We can take advantage of this linkage information to order Web pages according to their perceived quality.",
                "Imagine a Web surfer who jumps from Web page to Web page, choosing with uniform probability which link to follow at each step.",
                "In order to reduce the effect of dead-ends or endless cycles the surfer will occasionally jump to a random page with some small probability α, or when on a page with no out-links.",
                "If averaged over a sufficient number of steps, the probability the surfer is on page j at some point in time is given by the formula: ∑∈ + − = ji i iP N jP B F )()1( )( α α (1) Where Fi is the set of pages that page i links to, and Bj is the set of pages that link to page j.",
                "The PageRank score for node j is defined as this probability: PR(j)=P(j).",
                "Because equation (1) is recursive, it must be iteratively evaluated until P(j) converges (typically, the initial distribution for P(j) is uniform).",
                "The intuition is, because a random surfer would end up at the page more frequently, it is likely a better page.",
                "An alternative view for equation (1) is that each page is assigned a quality, P(j).",
                "A page gives an equal share of its quality to each page it points to.",
                "PageRank is computationally expensive.",
                "Our collection of 5 billion pages contains approximately 370 billion links.",
                "Computing PageRank requires iterating over these billions of links multiple times (until convergence).",
                "It requires large amounts of memory (or very smart caching schemes that slow the computation down even further), and if spread across multiple machines, requires significant communication between them.",
                "Though much work has been done on optimizing the PageRank computation (see e.g., [25] and [6]), it remains a relatively slow, computationally expensive property to compute. 3.",
                "RANKNET Much work in machine learning has been done on the problems of classification and regression.",
                "Let X={xi} be a collection of feature vectors (typically, a feature is any real valued number), and Y={yi} be a collection of associated classes, where yi is the class of the object described by feature vector xi.",

                "The closest similar work is on using click-through behavior (that is, which search engine results the users click on) to affect dynamic ranking (see e.g., [20]).",
                "Because we use a wide variety of features to come up with a static ranking, we refer to this as fRank (for feature-based ranking). fRank uses RankNet and the set of features described in this section to learn a ranking function for Web pages.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, fRank was trained with all of the features. 5.",
                "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we will demonstrate that we can out perform PageRank by applying machine learning to a straightforward set of features.",
                "Before the results, we first discuss the data, the performance metric, and the training method. 5.1 Data In order to evaluate the quality of a static ranking, we needed a gold standard defining the correct ordering for a set of pages.",
                "For this, we employed a dataset which contains human judgments for 28000 queries.",
                "For each query, a number of results are manually assigned a rating, from 0 to 4, by human judges.",
                "The rating is meant to be a measure of how relevant the result is for the query, where 0 means poor and 4 means excellent.",
                "There are approximately 500k judgments in all, or an average of 18 ratings per query.",
                "The queries are selected by randomly choosing queries from among those issued to the MSN search engine.",
                "The probability that a query is selected is proportional to its frequency among all 709 of the queries.",
                "As a result, common queries are more likely to be judged than uncommon queries.",
                "As an example of how diverse the queries are, the first four queries in the training set are chef schools, chicagoland speedway, eagles fan club, and Turkish culture.",
                "The documents selected for judging are those that we expected would, on average, be reasonably relevant (for example, the top ten documents returned by MSNs search engine).",
                "This provides significantly more information than randomly selecting documents on the Web, the vast majority of which would be irrelevant to a given query.",
                "Because of this process, the judged pages tend to be of higher quality than the average page on the Web, and tend to be pages that will be returned for common search queries.",
                "This bias is good when evaluating the quality of static ranking for the purposes of index ordering and returning relevant documents.",
                "This is because the most important portion of the index to be well-ordered and relevant is the portion that is frequently returned for search queries.",
                "Because of this bias, however, the results in this paper are not applicable to crawl prioritization.",
                "In order to obtain experimental results on crawl prioritization, we would need ratings on a random sample of Web pages.",
                "To convert the data from query-dependent to query-independent, we simply removed the query, taking the maximum over judgments for a URL that appears in more than one query.",
                "The reasoning behind this is that a page that is relevant for some query and irrelevant for another is probably a decent page and should have a high static rank.",
                "Because we evaluated the pages on queries that occur frequently, our data indicates the correct index ordering, and assigns high value to pages that are likely to be relevant to a common query.",
                "We randomly assigned queries to a training, validation, or test set, such that they contained 84%, 8%, and 8% of the queries, respectively.",
                "Each set contains all of the ratings for a given query, and no query appears in more than one set.",
                "The training set was used to train fRank.",
                "The validation set was used to select the model that had the highest performance.",
                "The test set was used for the final results.",
                "This data gives us a query-independent ordering of pages.",
                "The goal for a static ranking algorithm will be to reproduce this ordering as closely as possible.",
                "In the next section, we describe the measure we used to evaluate this. 5.2 Measure We chose to use pairwise accuracy to evaluate the quality of a static ranking.",
                "The pairwise accuracy is the fraction of time that the ranking algorithm and human judges agree on the ordering of a pair of Web pages.",
                "If S(x) is the static ranking assigned to page x, and H(x) is the human judgment of relevance for x, then consider the following sets: )}()(:,{ yHxHyx >=pH and )}()(:,{ ySxSyx >=pS The pairwise accuracy is the portion of Hp that is also contained in Sp: p pp H SH ∩ =accuracypairwise This measure was chosen for two reasons.",
                "First, the discrete human judgments provide only a partial ordering over Web pages, making it difficult to apply a measure such as the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (in the pairwise accuracy measure, a pair of documents with the same human judgment does not affect the score).",
                "Second, the pairwise accuracy has an intuitive meaning: it is the fraction of pairs of documents that, when the humans claim one is better than the other, the static rank algorithm orders them correctly. 5.3 Method We trained fRank (a RankNet based neural network) using the following parameters.",
                "We used a fully connected 2 layer network.",
                "The hidden layer had 10 hidden nodes.",
                "The input weights to this layer were all initialized to be zero.",
                "The output layer (just a single node) weights were initialized using a uniform random distribution in the range [-0.1, 0.1].",
                "We used tanh as the transfer function from the inputs to the hidden layer, and a linear function from the hidden layer to the output.",
                "The cost function is the pairwise cross entropy cost function as discussed in section 3.",
                "The features in the training set were normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.",
                "The same linear transformation was then applied to the features in the validation and test sets.",
                "For training, we presented the network with 5 million pairings of pages, where one page had a higher rating than the other.",
                "The pairings were chosen uniformly at random (with replacement) from all possible pairings.",
                "When forming the pairs, we ignored the magnitude of the difference between the ratings (the rating spread) for the two URLs.",
                "Hence, the weight for each pair was constant (one), and the probability of a pair being selected was independent of its rating spread.",
                "We trained the network for 30 epochs.",
                "On each epoch, the training pairs were randomly shuffled.",
                "The initial training rate was 0.001.",
                "At each epoch, we checked the error on the training set.",
                "If the error had increased, then we decreased the training rate, under the hypothesis that the network had probably overshot.",
                "The training rate at each epoch was thus set to: Training rate = 1+ε κ Where κ is the initial rate (0.001), and ε is the number of times the training set error has increased.",
                "After each epoch, we measured the performance of the neural network on the validation set, using 1 million pairs (chosen randomly with replacement).",
                "The network with the highest pairwise accuracy on the validation set was selected, and then tested on the test set.",
                "We report the pairwise accuracy on the test set, calculated using all possible pairs.",
                "These parameters were determined and fixed before the static rank experiments in this paper.",
                "In particular, the choice of initial training rate, number of epochs, and training rate decay function were taken directly from Burges et al [7].",
                "Though we had the option of preprocessing any of the features before they were input to the neural network, we refrained from doing so on most of them.",
                "The only exception was the popularity features.",
                "As with most Web phenomenon, we found that the distribution of site popularity is Zipfian.",
                "To reduce the dynamic range, and hopefully make the feature more useful, we presented the network with both the unpreprocessed, as well as the logarithm, of the popularity features (As with the others, the logarithmic feature values were also normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation). 710 Applying fRank to a document is computationally efficient, taking time that is only linear in the number of input features; it is thus within a constant factor of other simple machine learning methods such as naïve Bayes.",
                "In our experiments, computing the fRank for all five billion Web pages was approximately 100 times faster than computing the PageRank for the same set. 5.4 Results As Table 1 shows, fRank significantly outperforms PageRank for the purposes of static ranking.",
                "With a pairwise accuracy of 67.4%, fRank more than doubles the accuracy of PageRank (relative to the baseline of 50%, which is the accuracy that would be achieved by a random ordering of Web pages).",
                "Note that one of fRanks input features is the PageRank of the page, so we would expect it to perform no worse than PageRank.",
                "The significant increase in accuracy implies that the other features (anchor, popularity, etc.) do in fact contain useful information regarding the overall quality of a page.",
                "Table 1: Basic Results Technique Accuracy (%) None (Baseline) 50.00 PageRank 56.70 fRank 67.43 There are a number of decisions that go into the computation of PageRank, such as how to deal with pages that have no outlinks, the choice of α, numeric precision, convergence threshold, etc.",
                "We were able to obtain a computation of PageRank from a completely independent implementation (provided by Marc Najork) that varied somewhat in these parameters.",
                "It achieved a pairwise accuracy of 56.52%, nearly identical to that obtained by our implementation.",
                "We thus concluded that the quality of the PageRank is not sensitive to these minor variations in algorithm, nor was PageRanks low accuracy due to problems with our implementation of it.",
                "We also wanted to find how well each feature set performed.",
                "To answer this, for each feature set, we trained and tested fRank using only that set of features.",
                "The results are shown in Table 2.",
                "As can be seen, every single feature set individually outperformed PageRank on this test.",
                "Perhaps the most interesting result is that the Page-level features had the highest performance out of all the feature sets.",
                "This is surprising because these are features that do not depend on the overall graph structure of the Web, nor even on what pages point to a given page.",
                "This is contrary to the common belief that the Web graph structure is the key to finding a good static ranking of Web pages.",

                "They do not apply their techniques to the problem of static ranking. 6.3 Future work There are many ways in which we would like to extend this work.",
                "First, fRank uses only a small number of features.",
                "We believe we could achieve even more significant results with more features.",
                "In particular the existence, or lack thereof, of certain words could prove very significant (for instance, under construction probably signifies a low quality page).",
                "Other features could include the number of images on a page, size of those images, number of layout elements (tables, divs, and spans), use of style sheets, conforming to W3C standards (like XHTML 1.0 Strict), background color of a page, etc.",
                "Many pages are generated dynamically, the contents of which may depend on parameters in the URL, the time of day, the user visiting the site, or other variables.",
                "For such pages, it may be useful to apply the techniques found in [26] to form a static approximation for the purposes of extracting features.",
                "The resulting grammar describing the page could itself be a source of additional features describing the complexity of the page, such as how many non-terminal nodes it has, the depth of the grammar tree, etc. fRank allows one to specify a confidence in each pairing of documents.",
                "In the future, we will experiment with probabilities that depend on the difference in human judgments between the two items in the pair.",
                "For example, a pair of documents where one was rated 4 and the other 0 should have a higher confidence than a pair of documents rated 3 and 2.",
                "The experiments in this paper are biased toward pages that have higher than average quality.",
                "Also, fRank with all of the features can only be applied to pages that have already been crawled.",
                "Thus, fRank is primarily useful for index ordering and improving relevance, not for directing the crawl.",
                "We would like to investigate a machine learning approach for crawl prioritization as well.",
                "It may be that a combination of methods is best: for example, using PageRank to select the best 5 billion of the 20 billion pages on the Web, then using fRank to order the index and affect search relevancy.",
                "Another interesting direction for exploration is to incorporate fRank and page-level features directly into the PageRank computation itself.",
                "Work on biasing the PageRank jump vector [16], and transition matrix [29], have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of such an approach.",
                "There is reason to believe that a direct application of [29], using the fRank of a page for its relevance, could lead to an improved overall static rank.",

                "The general surfing and searching habits of Web users varies by time of day.",
                "Activity in the morning, daytime, and evening are often quite different (e.g., reading the news, solving problems, and accessing entertainment, respectively).",
                "We can gain insight into these differences by using the popularity data, divided into segments of the day.",
                "When a query is issued, we would then use the popularity data matching the time of query in order to do the ranking of Web pages.",
                "We also plan to explore popularity features that use more than just the counts of how often a page was visited.",
                "For example, how long users tended to dwell on a page, did they leave the page by clicking a link or by hitting the back button, etc.",
                "Fox et al. did a study that showed that features such as this can be valuable for the purposes of dynamic ranking [14].",
                "Finally, the popularity data could be used as the label rather than as a feature.",
                "Using fRank in this way to predict the popularity of a page may useful for the tasks of relevance, efficiency, and crawl priority.",
                "There is also significantly more popularity data than human labeled data, potentially enabling more complex machine learning methods, and significantly more features. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS A good static ranking is an important component for todays search engines and information retrieval systems.",
                "We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank.",
                "By combining many static features, fRank achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise accuracy than PageRank alone.",
                "A qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that Web users, rather than Web authors, visit.",
                "The machine learning component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further developments in the machine learning community in areas such as <br>adversarial classification</br>.",

                "The number of incorrect, spamming, and malicious (e.g., phishing) sites has also grown rapidly.",
                "The sheer number of both good and bad pages on the Web has led to an increasing reliance on search engines for the discovery of useful information.",
                "Users rely on search engines not only to return pages related to their search query, but also to separate the good from the bad, and order results so that the best pages are suggested first.",
                "To date, most work on Web page ranking has focused on improving the ordering of the results returned to the user (querydependent ranking, or dynamic ranking).",
                "However, having a good query-independent ranking (static ranking) is also crucially important for a search engine.",
                "A good static ranking algorithm provides numerous benefits: • Relevance: The static rank of a page provides a general indicator to the overall quality of the page.",
                "This is a useful input to the dynamic ranking algorithm. • Efficiency: Typically, the search engines index is ordered by static rank.",
                "By traversing the index from highquality to low-quality pages, the dynamic ranker may abort the search when it determines that no later page will have as high of a dynamic rank as those already found.",
                "The more accurate the static rank, the better this early-stopping ability, and hence the quicker the search engine may respond to queries. • Crawl Priority: The Web grows and changes as quickly as search engines can crawl it.",
                "Search engines need a way to prioritize their crawl-to determine which pages to recrawl, how frequently, and how often to seek out new pages.",
                "Among other factors, the static rank of a page is used to determine this prioritization.",
                "A better static rank thus provides the engine with a higher quality, more upto-date index.",
                "Google is often regarded as the first commercially successful search engine.",
                "Their ranking was originally based on the PageRank algorithm [5][27].",
                "Due to this (and possibly due to Googles promotion of PageRank to the public), PageRank is widely regarded as the best method for the static ranking of Web pages.",
                "Though PageRank has historically been thought to perform quite well, there has yet been little academic evidence to support this claim.",
                "Even worse, there has recently been work showing that PageRank may not perform any better than other simple measures on certain tasks.",
                "Upstill et al. have found that for the task of finding home pages, the number of pages linking to a page and the type of URL were as, or more, effective than PageRank [32].",

                "In this paper, we show there are a number of simple url- or pagebased features that significantly outperform PageRank (for the purposes of statically ranking Web pages) despite ignoring the structure of the Web.",
                "We combine these and other static features using machine learning to achieve a ranking system that is significantly better than PageRank (in pairwise agreement with human labels).",
                "A machine learning approach for static ranking has other advantages besides the quality of the ranking.",
                "Because the measure consists of many features, it is harder for malicious users to manipulate it (i.e., to raise their pages static rank to an undeserved level through questionable techniques, also known as Web spamming).",
                "This is particularly true if the feature set is not known.",
                "In contrast, a single measure like PageRank can be easier to manipulate because spammers need only concentrate on one goal: how to cause more pages to point to their page.",
                "With an algorithm that learns, a feature that becomes unusable due to spammer manipulation will simply be reduced or removed from the final computation of rank.",

                "A machine learning approach to static ranking is also able to take advantage of any advances in the machine learning field.",
                "For example, recent work on adversarial classification [12] suggests that it may be possible to explicitly model the Web page spammers (the adversary) actions, adjusting the ranking model in advance of the spammers attempts to circumvent it.",
                "Another example is the elimination of outliers in constructing the model, which helps reduce the effect that unique sites may have on the overall quality of the static rank.",
                "By moving static ranking to a machine learning framework, we not only gain in accuracy, but also gain in the ability to react to spammers actions, to rapidly add new features to the ranking algorithm, and to leverage advances in the rapidly growing field of machine learning.",
                "Finally, we believe there will be significant advantages to using this technique for other domains, such as searching a local hard drive or a corporations intranet.",
                "These are domains where the link structure is particularly weak (or non-existent), but there are other domain-specific features that could be just as powerful.",
                "For example, the author of an intranet page and his/her position in the organization (e.g., CEO, manager, or developer) could provide significant clues as to the importance of that page.",

                "Before the results, we first discuss the data, the performance metric, and the training method. 5.1 Data In order to evaluate the quality of a static ranking, we needed a gold standard defining the correct ordering for a set of pages.",
                "For this, we employed a dataset which contains human judgments for 28000 queries.",
                "For each query, a number of results are manually assigned a rating, from 0 to 4, by human judges.",
                "The rating is meant to be a measure of how relevant the result is for the query, where 0 means poor and 4 means excellent.",
                "There are approximately 500k judgments in all, or an average of 18 ratings per query.",
                "The queries are selected by randomly choosing queries from among those issued to the MSN search engine.",
                "The probability that a query is selected is proportional to its frequency among all 709 of the queries.",
                "As a result, common queries are more likely to be judged than uncommon queries.",
                "As an example of how diverse the queries are, the first four queries in the training set are chef schools, chicagoland speedway, eagles fan club, and Turkish culture.",
                "The documents selected for judging are those that we expected would, on average, be reasonably relevant (for example, the top ten documents returned by MSNs search engine).",
                "This provides significantly more information than randomly selecting documents on the Web, the vast majority of which would be irrelevant to a given query.",
                "Because of this process, the judged pages tend to be of higher quality than the average page on the Web, and tend to be pages that will be returned for common search queries.",
                "This bias is good when evaluating the quality of static ranking for the purposes of index ordering and returning relevant documents.",
                "This is because the most important portion of the index to be well-ordered and relevant is the portion that is frequently returned for search queries.",
                "Because of this bias, however, the results in this paper are not applicable to crawl prioritization.",
                "In order to obtain experimental results on crawl prioritization, we would need ratings on a random sample of Web pages.",
                "To convert the data from query-dependent to query-independent, we simply removed the query, taking the maximum over judgments for a URL that appears in more than one query.",
                "The reasoning behind this is that a page that is relevant for some query and irrelevant for another is probably a decent page and should have a high static rank.",
                "Because we evaluated the pages on queries that occur frequently, our data indicates the correct index ordering, and assigns high value to pages that are likely to be relevant to a common query.",
                "We randomly assigned queries to a training, validation, or test set, such that they contained 84%, 8%, and 8% of the queries, respectively.",
                "Each set contains all of the ratings for a given query, and no query appears in more than one set.",
                "The training set was used to train fRank.",
                "The validation set was used to select the model that had the highest performance.",
                "The test set was used for the final results.",
                "This data gives us a query-independent ordering of pages.",
                "The goal for a static ranking algorithm will be to reproduce this ordering as closely as possible.",
                "In the next section, we describe the measure we used to evaluate this. 5.2 Measure We chose to use pairwise accuracy to evaluate the quality of a static ranking.",
                "The pairwise accuracy is the fraction of time that the ranking algorithm and human judges agree on the ordering of a pair of Web pages.",
                "If S(x) is the static ranking assigned to page x, and H(x) is the human judgment of relevance for x, then consider the following sets: )}()(:,{ yHxHyx >=pH and )}()(:,{ ySxSyx >=pS The pairwise accuracy is the portion of Hp that is also contained in Sp: p pp H SH ∩ =accuracypairwise This measure was chosen for two reasons.",
                "First, the discrete human judgments provide only a partial ordering over Web pages, making it difficult to apply a measure such as the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (in the pairwise accuracy measure, a pair of documents with the same human judgment does not affect the score).",
                "Second, the pairwise accuracy has an intuitive meaning: it is the fraction of pairs of documents that, when the humans claim one is better than the other, the static rank algorithm orders them correctly. 5.3 Method We trained fRank (a RankNet based neural network) using the following parameters.",
                "We used a fully connected 2 layer network.",
                "The hidden layer had 10 hidden nodes.",
                "The input weights to this layer were all initialized to be zero.",
                "The output layer (just a single node) weights were initialized using a uniform random distribution in the range [-0.1, 0.1].",
                "We used tanh as the transfer function from the inputs to the hidden layer, and a linear function from the hidden layer to the output.",
                "The cost function is the pairwise cross entropy cost function as discussed in section 3.",
                "The features in the training set were normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.",
                "The same linear transformation was then applied to the features in the validation and test sets.",
                "For training, we presented the network with 5 million pairings of pages, where one page had a higher rating than the other.",
                "The pairings were chosen uniformly at random (with replacement) from all possible pairings.",
                "When forming the pairs, we ignored the magnitude of the difference between the ratings (the rating spread) for the two URLs.",
                "Hence, the weight for each pair was constant (one), and the probability of a pair being selected was independent of its rating spread.",
                "We trained the network for 30 epochs.",
                "On each epoch, the training pairs were randomly shuffled.",
                "The initial training rate was 0.001.",
                "At each epoch, we checked the error on the training set.",
                "If the error had increased, then we decreased the training rate, under the hypothesis that the network had probably overshot.",
                "The training rate at each epoch was thus set to: Training rate = 1+ε κ Where κ is the initial rate (0.001), and ε is the number of times the training set error has increased.",
                "After each epoch, we measured the performance of the neural network on the validation set, using 1 million pairs (chosen randomly with replacement).",
                "The network with the highest pairwise accuracy on the validation set was selected, and then tested on the test set.",
                "We report the pairwise accuracy on the test set, calculated using all possible pairs.",
                "These parameters were determined and fixed before the static rank experiments in this paper.",
                "In particular, the choice of initial training rate, number of epochs, and training rate decay function were taken directly from Burges et al [7].",
                "Though we had the option of preprocessing any of the features before they were input to the neural network, we refrained from doing so on most of them.",
                "The only exception was the popularity features.",
                "As with most Web phenomenon, we found that the distribution of site popularity is Zipfian.",
                "To reduce the dynamic range, and hopefully make the feature more useful, we presented the network with both the unpreprocessed, as well as the logarithm, of the popularity features (As with the others, the logarithmic feature values were also normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation). 710 Applying fRank to a document is computationally efficient, taking time that is only linear in the number of input features; it is thus within a constant factor of other simple machine learning methods such as naïve Bayes.",
                "In our experiments, computing the fRank for all five billion Web pages was approximately 100 times faster than computing the PageRank for the same set. 5.4 Results As Table 1 shows, fRank significantly outperforms PageRank for the purposes of static ranking.",
                "With a pairwise accuracy of 67.4%, fRank more than doubles the accuracy of PageRank (relative to the baseline of 50%, which is the accuracy that would be achieved by a random ordering of Web pages).",
                "Note that one of fRanks input features is the PageRank of the page, so we would expect it to perform no worse than PageRank.",
                "The significant increase in accuracy implies that the other features (anchor, popularity, etc.) do in fact contain useful information regarding the overall quality of a page.",
                "Table 1: Basic Results Technique Accuracy (%) None (Baseline) 50.00 PageRank 56.70 fRank 67.43 There are a number of decisions that go into the computation of PageRank, such as how to deal with pages that have no outlinks, the choice of α, numeric precision, convergence threshold, etc.",
                "We were able to obtain a computation of PageRank from a completely independent implementation (provided by Marc Najork) that varied somewhat in these parameters.",
                "It achieved a pairwise accuracy of 56.52%, nearly identical to that obtained by our implementation.",
                "We thus concluded that the quality of the PageRank is not sensitive to these minor variations in algorithm, nor was PageRanks low accuracy due to problems with our implementation of it.",
                "We also wanted to find how well each feature set performed.",
                "To answer this, for each feature set, we trained and tested fRank using only that set of features.",
                "The results are shown in Table 2.",
                "As can be seen, every single feature set individually outperformed PageRank on this test.",
                "Perhaps the most interesting result is that the Page-level features had the highest performance out of all the feature sets.",
                "This is surprising because these are features that do not depend on the overall graph structure of the Web, nor even on what pages point to a given page.",

                "The results confirm that fRank outperforms PageRank in pairwise accuracy.",
                "The two most important feature sets are the page and popularity features.",
                "This is surprising, as the page features consisted only of a few (8) simple features.",
                "Further experiments found that, of the page features, those based on the text of the page (as opposed to the URL) performed the best.",
                "In the next section, we explore the popularity feature in more detail. 5.5 Popularity Data As mentioned in section 4, our popularity data came from MSN toolbar users.",
                "For privacy reasons, we had access only to an aggregate count of, for each URL, how many times it was visited by any toolbar user.",
                "This limited the possible features we could derive from this data.",
                "For possible extensions, see section 6.3, future work.",
                "For each URL in our train and test sets, we provided a feature to fRank which was how many times it had been visited by a toolbar user.",
                "However, this feature was quite noisy and sparse, particularly for URLs with query parameters (e.g., http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=machine+learning&form=QBHP).",
                "One solution was to provide an additional feature which was the number of times any URL at the given domain was visited by a toolbar user.",
                "Adding this feature dramatically improved the performance of fRank.",
                "We took this one step further and used the built-in hierarchical structure of URLs to construct many levels of backoff between the full URL and the domain.",
                "We did this by using the set of features shown in Table 6.",
                "Table 6: URL functions used to compute the Popularity feature set.",
                "Function Example Exact URL cnn.com/2005/tech/wikipedia.html?v=mobile No Params cnn.com/2005/tech/wikipedia.html Page wikipedia.html URL-1 cnn.com/2005/tech URL-2 cnn.com/2005 … Domain cnn.com Domain+1 cnn.com/2005 … Each URL was assigned one feature for each function shown in the table.",
                "The value of the feature was the count of the number of times a toolbar user visited a URL, where the function applied to that URL matches the function applied to the URL in question.",
                "For example, a users visit to cnn.com/2005/sports.html would increment the Domain and Domain+1 features for the URL cnn.com/2005/tech/wikipedia.html.",
                "As seen in Table 7, adding the domain counts significantly improved the quality of the popularity feature, and adding the numerous backoff functions listed in Table 6 improved the accuracy even further.",
                "Table 7: Effect of adding backoff to the popularity feature set Features Accuracy (%) URL count 58.15 URL and Domain counts 59.31 All backoff functions (Table 6) 60.82 Table 5: Top ten URLs for PageRank vs. fRank PageRank fRank google.com google.com apple.com/quicktime/download yahoo.com amazon.com americanexpress.com yahoo.com hp.com microsoft.com/windows/ie target.com apple.com/quicktime bestbuy.com mapquest.com dell.com ebay.com autotrader.com mozilla.org/products/firefox dogpile.com ftc.gov bankofamerica.com 712 Backing off to subsets of the URL is one technique for dealing with the sparsity of data.",
                "It is also informative to see how the performance of fRank depends on the amount of popularity data that we have collected.",
                "In Figure 1 we show the performance of fRank trained with only the popularity feature set vs. the amount of data we have for the popularity feature set.",
                "Each day, we receive additional popularity data, and as can be seen in the plot, this increases the performance of fRank.",
                "The relation is logarithmic: doubling the amount of popularity data provides a constant improvement in pairwise accuracy.",
                "In summary, we have found that the popularity features provide a useful boost to the overall fRank accuracy.",
                "Gathering more popularity data, as well as employing simple backoff strategies, improve this boost even further. 5.6 Summary of Results The experiments provide a number of conclusions.",
                "First, fRank performs significantly better than PageRank, even without any information about the Web graph.",
                "Second, the page level and popularity features were the most significant contributors to pairwise accuracy.",
                "Third, by collecting more popularity data, we can continue to improve fRanks performance.",
                "The popularity data provides two benefits to fRank.",
                "First, we see that qualitatively, fRanks ordering of Web pages has a more favorable bias than PageRanks. fRanks ordering seems to correspond to what Web users, rather than Web page authors, prefer.",
                "Second, the popularity data is more timely than PageRanks link information.",
                "The toolbar provides information about which Web pages people find interesting right now, whereas links are added to pages more slowly, as authors find the time and interest. 6.",
                "RELATED AND FUTURE WORK 6.1 Improvements to PageRank Since the original PageRank paper, there has been work on improving it.",
                "Much of that work centers on speeding up and parallelizing the computation [15][25].",
                "One recognized problem with PageRank is that of topic drift: A page about dogs will have high PageRank if it is linked to by many pages that themselves have high rank, regardless of their topic.",
                "In contrast, a search engine user looking for good pages about dogs would likely prefer to find pages that are pointed to by many pages that are themselves about dogs.",
                "Hence, a link that is on topic should have higher weight than a link that is not.",
                "Richardson and Domingoss Query Dependent PageRank [29] and Haveliwalas Topic-Sensitive PageRank [16] are two approaches that tackle this problem.",
                "Other variations to PageRank include differently weighting links for inter- vs. intra-domain links, adding a backwards step to the random surfer to simulate the back button on most browsers [24] and modifying the jump probability (α) [3].",
                "See Langville and Meyer [23] for a good survey of these, and other modifications to PageRank. 6.2 Other related work PageRank is not the only link analysis algorithm used for ranking Web pages.",
                "The most well-known other is HITS [22], which is used by the Teoma search engine [30].",
                "HITS produces a list of hubs and authorities, where hubs are pages that point to many authority pages, and authorities are pages that are pointed to by many hubs.",
                "Previous work has shown HITS to perform comparably to PageRank [1].",
                "One field of interest is that of static index pruning (see e.g., Carmel et al. [8]).",
                "Static index pruning methods reduce the size of the search engines index by removing documents that are unlikely to be returned by a search query.",
                "The pruning is typically done based on the frequency of query terms.",
                "Similarly, Pandey and Olston [28] suggest crawling pages frequently if they are likely to incorrectly appear (or not appear) as a result of a search.",
                "Similar methods could be incorporated into the static rank (e.g., how many frequent queries contain words found on this page).",
                "Others have investigated the effect that PageRank has on the Web at large [9].",
                "They argue that pages with high PageRank are more likely to be found by Web users, thus more likely to be linked to, and thus more likely to maintain a higher PageRank than other pages.",
                "The same may occur for the popularity data.",
                "If we increase the ranking for popular pages, they are more likely to be clicked on, thus further increasing their popularity.",
                "Cho et al. [10] argue that a more appropriate measure of Web page quality would depend on not only the current link structure of the Web, but also on the change in that link structure.",
                "The same technique may be applicable to popularity data: the change in popularity of a page may be more informative than the absolute popularity.",
                "One interesting related work is that of Ivory and Hearst [19].",
                "Their goal was to build a model of Web sites that are considered high quality from the perspective of content, structure and navigation, visual design, functionality, interactivity, and overall experience.",
                "They used over 100 page level features, as well as features encompassing the performance and structure of the site.",
                "This let them qualitatively describe the qualities of a page that make it appear attractive (e.g., rare use of italics, at least 9 point font, …), and (in later work) to build a system that assists novel Web page authors in creating quality pages by evaluating it according to these features.",
                "The primary differences between this work and ours are the goal (discovering what constitutes a good Web page vs. ordering Web pages for the purposes of Web search), the size of the study (they used a dataset of less than 6000 pages vs. our set of 468,000), and our comparison with PageRank. y = 0.577Ln(x) + 58.283 R 2 = 0.9822 58 58.5 59 59.5 60 60.5 61 1 10 100 Days of Toolbar Data PairwiseAccuracy Figure 1: Relation between the amount of popularity data and the performance of the popularity feature set.",
                "Note the x-axis is a logarithmic scale. 713 Nevertheless, their work provides insights to additional useful static features that we could incorporate into fRank in the future.",
                "Recent work on incorporating novel features into dynamic ranking includes that by Joachims et al. [21], who investigate the use of implicit feedback from users, in the form of which search engine results are clicked on.",
                "Craswell et al. [11] present a method for determining the best transformation to apply to query independent features (such as those used in this paper) for the purposes of improving dynamic ranking.",
                "Other work, such as Boyan et al. [4] and Bartell et al. [2] apply machine learning for the purposes of improving the overall relevance of a search engine (i.e., the dynamic ranking).",
                "They do not apply their techniques to the problem of static ranking. 6.3 Future work There are many ways in which we would like to extend this work.",
                "First, fRank uses only a small number of features.",
                "We believe we could achieve even more significant results with more features.",
                "In particular the existence, or lack thereof, of certain words could prove very significant (for instance, under construction probably signifies a low quality page).",
                "Other features could include the number of images on a page, size of those images, number of layout elements (tables, divs, and spans), use of style sheets, conforming to W3C standards (like XHTML 1.0 Strict), background color of a page, etc.",
                "Many pages are generated dynamically, the contents of which may depend on parameters in the URL, the time of day, the user visiting the site, or other variables.",
                "For such pages, it may be useful to apply the techniques found in [26] to form a static approximation for the purposes of extracting features.",
                "The resulting grammar describing the page could itself be a source of additional features describing the complexity of the page, such as how many non-terminal nodes it has, the depth of the grammar tree, etc. fRank allows one to specify a confidence in each pairing of documents.",
                "In the future, we will experiment with probabilities that depend on the difference in human judgments between the two items in the pair.",
                "For example, a pair of documents where one was rated 4 and the other 0 should have a higher confidence than a pair of documents rated 3 and 2.",
                "The experiments in this paper are biased toward pages that have higher than average quality.",
                "Also, fRank with all of the features can only be applied to pages that have already been crawled.",
                "Thus, fRank is primarily useful for index ordering and improving relevance, not for directing the crawl.",
                "We would like to investigate a machine learning approach for crawl prioritization as well.",
                "It may be that a combination of methods is best: for example, using PageRank to select the best 5 billion of the 20 billion pages on the Web, then using fRank to order the index and affect search relevancy.",
                "Another interesting direction for exploration is to incorporate fRank and page-level features directly into the PageRank computation itself.",
                "Work on biasing the PageRank jump vector [16], and transition matrix [29], have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of such an approach.",
                "There is reason to believe that a direct application of [29], using the fRank of a page for its relevance, could lead to an improved overall static rank.",
                "Finally, the popularity data can be used in other interesting ways.",
                "The general surfing and searching habits of Web users varies by time of day.",
                "Activity in the morning, daytime, and evening are often quite different (e.g., reading the news, solving problems, and accessing entertainment, respectively).",
                "We can gain insight into these differences by using the popularity data, divided into segments of the day.",
                "When a query is issued, we would then use the popularity data matching the time of query in order to do the ranking of Web pages.",
                "We also plan to explore popularity features that use more than just the counts of how often a page was visited.",
                "For example, how long users tended to dwell on a page, did they leave the page by clicking a link or by hitting the back button, etc.",
                "Fox et al. did a study that showed that features such as this can be valuable for the purposes of dynamic ranking [14].",
                "Finally, the popularity data could be used as the label rather than as a feature.",
                "Using fRank in this way to predict the popularity of a page may useful for the tasks of relevance, efficiency, and crawl priority.",
                "There is also significantly more popularity data than human labeled data, potentially enabling more complex machine learning methods, and significantly more features. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS A good static ranking is an important component for todays search engines and information retrieval systems.",
                "We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank.",
                "By combining many static features, fRank achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise accuracy than PageRank alone.",
                "A qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that Web users, rather than Web authors, visit.",
                "The machine learning component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further developments in the machine learning community in areas such as adversarial classification.",
                "We have only begun to explore the options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the area of static ranking by further experimentation with additional features, other machine learning techniques, and additional sources of data. 8.",

                "Unfortunately, this growth has not been isolated to good-quality pages.",
                "The number of incorrect, spamming, and malicious (e.g., phishing) sites has also grown rapidly.",
                "The sheer number of both good and bad pages on the Web has led to an increasing reliance on search engines for the discovery of useful information.",
                "Users rely on search engines not only to return pages related to their search query, but also to separate the good from the bad, and order results so that the best pages are suggested first.",
                "To date, most work on Web page ranking has focused on improving the ordering of the results returned to the user (querydependent ranking, or dynamic ranking).",
                "However, having a good query-independent ranking (static ranking) is also crucially important for a search engine.",
                "A good static ranking algorithm provides numerous benefits: • <br>relevance</br>: The static rank of a page provides a general indicator to the overall quality of the page.",
                "This is a useful input to the dynamic ranking algorithm. • Efficiency: Typically, the search engines index is ordered by static rank.",
                "By traversing the index from highquality to low-quality pages, the dynamic ranker may abort the search when it determines that no later page will have as high of a dynamic rank as those already found.",
                "The more accurate the static rank, the better this early-stopping ability, and hence the quicker the search engine may respond to queries. • Crawl Priority: The Web grows and changes as quickly as search engines can crawl it.",
                "Search engines need a way to prioritize their crawl-to determine which pages to recrawl, how frequently, and how often to seek out new pages.",
                "Among other factors, the static rank of a page is used to determine this prioritization.",
                "A better static rank thus provides the engine with a higher quality, more upto-date index.",
                "Google is often regarded as the first commercially successful search engine.",
                "Their ranking was originally based on the PageRank algorithm [5][27].",
                "Due to this (and possibly due to Googles promotion of PageRank to the public), PageRank is widely regarded as the best method for the static ranking of Web pages.",
                "Though PageRank has historically been thought to perform quite well, there has yet been little academic evidence to support this claim.",
                "Even worse, there has recently been work showing that PageRank may not perform any better than other simple measures on certain tasks.",
                "Upstill et al. have found that for the task of finding home pages, the number of pages linking to a page and the type of URL were as, or more, effective than PageRank [32].",

                "We combine these and other static features using machine learning to achieve a ranking system that is significantly better than PageRank (in pairwise agreement with human labels).",
                "A machine learning approach for static ranking has other advantages besides the quality of the ranking.",
                "Because the measure consists of many features, it is harder for malicious users to manipulate it (i.e., to raise their pages static rank to an undeserved level through questionable techniques, also known as Web spamming).",
                "This is particularly true if the feature set is not known.",
                "In contrast, a single measure like PageRank can be easier to manipulate because spammers need only concentrate on one goal: how to cause more pages to point to their page.",
                "With an algorithm that learns, a feature that becomes unusable due to spammer manipulation will simply be reduced or removed from the final computation of rank.",

                "A machine learning approach to static ranking is also able to take advantage of any advances in the machine learning field.",
                "For example, recent work on adversarial classification [12] suggests that it may be possible to explicitly model the Web page spammers (the adversary) actions, adjusting the ranking model in advance of the spammers attempts to circumvent it.",
                "Another example is the elimination of outliers in constructing the model, which helps reduce the effect that unique sites may have on the overall quality of the static rank.",
                "By moving static ranking to a machine learning framework, we not only gain in accuracy, but also gain in the ability to react to spammers actions, to rapidly add new features to the ranking algorithm, and to leverage advances in the rapidly growing field of machine learning.",
                "Finally, we believe there will be significant advantages to using this technique for other domains, such as searching a local hard drive or a corporations intranet.",
                "These are domains where the link structure is particularly weak (or non-existent), but there are other domain-specific features that could be just as powerful.",
                "For example, the author of an intranet page and his/her position in the organization (e.g., CEO, manager, or developer) could provide significant clues as to the importance of that page.",

                "This papers contribution is a systematic study of static features, including PageRank, for the purposes of (statically) ranking Web pages.",
                "Previous studies on PageRank typically used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g., the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages).",
                "Also, the performance of PageRank and other static features has typically been evaluated in the context of a complete system for dynamic ranking, or for other tasks such as question answering.",

                "PAGERANK The basic idea behind PageRank is simple: a link from a Web page to another can be seen as an endorsement of that page.",
                "In general, links are made by people.",
                "As such, they are indicative of the quality of the pages to which they point - when creating a page, an author presumably chooses to link to pages deemed to be of good quality.",
                "We can take advantage of this linkage information to order Web pages according to their perceived quality.",
                "Imagine a Web surfer who jumps from Web page to Web page, choosing with uniform probability which link to follow at each step.",
                "In order to reduce the effect of dead-ends or endless cycles the surfer will occasionally jump to a random page with some small probability α, or when on a page with no out-links.",
                "If averaged over a sufficient number of steps, the probability the surfer is on page j at some point in time is given by the formula: ∑∈ + − = ji i iP N jP B F )()1( )( α α (1) Where Fi is the set of pages that page i links to, and Bj is the set of pages that link to page j.",
                "The PageRank score for node j is defined as this probability: PR(j)=P(j).",
                "Because equation (1) is recursive, it must be iteratively evaluated until P(j) converges (typically, the initial distribution for P(j) is uniform).",
                "The intuition is, because a random surfer would end up at the page more frequently, it is likely a better page.",
                "An alternative view for equation (1) is that each page is assigned a quality, P(j).",

                "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we will demonstrate that we can out perform PageRank by applying machine learning to a straightforward set of features.",
                "Before the results, we first discuss the data, the performance metric, and the training method. 5.1 Data In order to evaluate the quality of a static ranking, we needed a gold standard defining the correct ordering for a set of pages.",
                "For this, we employed a dataset which contains human judgments for 28000 queries.",
                "For each query, a number of results are manually assigned a rating, from 0 to 4, by human judges.",
                "The rating is meant to be a measure of how relevant the result is for the query, where 0 means poor and 4 means excellent.",
                "There are approximately 500k judgments in all, or an average of 18 ratings per query.",
                "The queries are selected by randomly choosing queries from among those issued to the MSN search engine.",
                "The probability that a query is selected is proportional to its frequency among all 709 of the queries.",
                "As a result, common queries are more likely to be judged than uncommon queries.",
                "As an example of how diverse the queries are, the first four queries in the training set are chef schools, chicagoland speedway, eagles fan club, and Turkish culture.",
                "The documents selected for judging are those that we expected would, on average, be reasonably relevant (for example, the top ten documents returned by MSNs search engine).",
                "This provides significantly more information than randomly selecting documents on the Web, the vast majority of which would be irrelevant to a given query.",
                "Because of this process, the judged pages tend to be of higher quality than the average page on the Web, and tend to be pages that will be returned for common search queries.",
                "This bias is good when evaluating the quality of static ranking for the purposes of index ordering and returning relevant documents.",
                "This is because the most important portion of the index to be well-ordered and relevant is the portion that is frequently returned for search queries.",
                "Because of this bias, however, the results in this paper are not applicable to crawl prioritization.",
                "In order to obtain experimental results on crawl prioritization, we would need ratings on a random sample of Web pages.",
                "To convert the data from query-dependent to query-independent, we simply removed the query, taking the maximum over judgments for a URL that appears in more than one query.",
                "The reasoning behind this is that a page that is relevant for some query and irrelevant for another is probably a decent page and should have a high static rank.",
                "Because we evaluated the pages on queries that occur frequently, our data indicates the correct index ordering, and assigns high value to pages that are likely to be relevant to a common query.",
                "We randomly assigned queries to a training, validation, or test set, such that they contained 84%, 8%, and 8% of the queries, respectively.",
                "Each set contains all of the ratings for a given query, and no query appears in more than one set.",
                "The training set was used to train fRank.",
                "The validation set was used to select the model that had the highest performance.",
                "The test set was used for the final results.",
                "This data gives us a query-independent ordering of pages.",
                "The goal for a static ranking algorithm will be to reproduce this ordering as closely as possible.",
                "In the next section, we describe the measure we used to evaluate this. 5.2 Measure We chose to use pairwise accuracy to evaluate the quality of a static ranking.",
                "The pairwise accuracy is the fraction of time that the ranking algorithm and human judges agree on the ordering of a pair of Web pages.",
                "If S(x) is the static ranking assigned to page x, and H(x) is the human judgment of <br>relevance</br> for x, then consider the following sets: )}()(:,{ yHxHyx >=pH and )}()(:,{ ySxSyx >=pS The pairwise accuracy is the portion of Hp that is also contained in Sp: p pp H SH ∩ =accuracypairwise This measure was chosen for two reasons.",
                "First, the discrete human judgments provide only a partial ordering over Web pages, making it difficult to apply a measure such as the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (in the pairwise accuracy measure, a pair of documents with the same human judgment does not affect the score).",
                "Second, the pairwise accuracy has an intuitive meaning: it is the fraction of pairs of documents that, when the humans claim one is better than the other, the static rank algorithm orders them correctly. 5.3 Method We trained fRank (a RankNet based neural network) using the following parameters.",
                "We used a fully connected 2 layer network.",
                "The hidden layer had 10 hidden nodes.",
                "The input weights to this layer were all initialized to be zero.",

                "They do not apply their techniques to the problem of static ranking. 6.3 Future work There are many ways in which we would like to extend this work.",
                "First, fRank uses only a small number of features.",
                "We believe we could achieve even more significant results with more features.",
                "In particular the existence, or lack thereof, of certain words could prove very significant (for instance, under construction probably signifies a low quality page).",
                "Other features could include the number of images on a page, size of those images, number of layout elements (tables, divs, and spans), use of style sheets, conforming to W3C standards (like XHTML 1.0 Strict), background color of a page, etc.",
                "Many pages are generated dynamically, the contents of which may depend on parameters in the URL, the time of day, the user visiting the site, or other variables.",
                "For such pages, it may be useful to apply the techniques found in [26] to form a static approximation for the purposes of extracting features.",
                "The resulting grammar describing the page could itself be a source of additional features describing the complexity of the page, such as how many non-terminal nodes it has, the depth of the grammar tree, etc. fRank allows one to specify a confidence in each pairing of documents.",
                "In the future, we will experiment with probabilities that depend on the difference in human judgments between the two items in the pair.",
                "For example, a pair of documents where one was rated 4 and the other 0 should have a higher confidence than a pair of documents rated 3 and 2.",
                "The experiments in this paper are biased toward pages that have higher than average quality.",
                "Also, fRank with all of the features can only be applied to pages that have already been crawled.",
                "Thus, fRank is primarily useful for index ordering and improving <br>relevance</br>, not for directing the crawl.",
                "We would like to investigate a machine learning approach for crawl prioritization as well.",
                "It may be that a combination of methods is best: for example, using PageRank to select the best 5 billion of the 20 billion pages on the Web, then using fRank to order the index and affect search relevancy.",
                "Another interesting direction for exploration is to incorporate fRank and page-level features directly into the PageRank computation itself.",
                "Work on biasing the PageRank jump vector [16], and transition matrix [29], have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of such an approach.",

                "Finally, the popularity data can be used in other interesting ways.",
                "The general surfing and searching habits of Web users varies by time of day.",
                "Activity in the morning, daytime, and evening are often quite different (e.g., reading the news, solving problems, and accessing entertainment, respectively).",
                "We can gain insight into these differences by using the popularity data, divided into segments of the day.",
                "When a query is issued, we would then use the popularity data matching the time of query in order to do the ranking of Web pages.",
                "We also plan to explore popularity features that use more than just the counts of how often a page was visited.",
                "For example, how long users tended to dwell on a page, did they leave the page by clicking a link or by hitting the back button, etc.",
                "Fox et al. did a study that showed that features such as this can be valuable for the purposes of dynamic ranking [14].",
                "Finally, the popularity data could be used as the label rather than as a feature.",
                "Using fRank in this way to predict the popularity of a page may useful for the tasks of <br>relevance</br>, efficiency, and crawl priority.",
                "There is also significantly more popularity data than human labeled data, potentially enabling more complex machine learning methods, and significantly more features. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS A good static ranking is an important component for todays search engines and information retrieval systems.",
                "We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank.",
                "By combining many static features, fRank achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise accuracy than PageRank alone.",
                "A qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that Web users, rather than Web authors, visit.",

                "Unfortunately, this growth has not been isolated to good-quality pages.",
                "The number of incorrect, spamming, and malicious (e.g., phishing) sites has also grown rapidly.",
                "The sheer number of both good and bad pages on the Web has led to an increasing reliance on search engines for the discovery of useful information.",
                "Users rely on search engines not only to return pages related to their search query, but also to separate the good from the bad, and order results so that the best pages are suggested first.",
                "To date, most work on Web page ranking has focused on improving the ordering of the results returned to the user (querydependent ranking, or dynamic ranking).",
                "However, having a good query-independent ranking (static ranking) is also crucially important for a search engine.",
                "A good static ranking algorithm provides numerous benefits: • Relevance: The static rank of a page provides a general indicator to the overall quality of the page.",
                "This is a useful input to the dynamic ranking algorithm. • Efficiency: Typically, the search engines index is ordered by static rank.",
                "By traversing the index from highquality to low-quality pages, the dynamic ranker may abort the search when it determines that no later page will have as high of a dynamic rank as those already found.",
                "The more accurate the static rank, the better this early-stopping ability, and hence the quicker the search engine may respond to queries. • Crawl Priority: The Web grows and changes as quickly as search engines can crawl it.",
                "Search engines need a way to prioritize their crawl-to determine which pages to recrawl, how frequently, and how often to seek out new pages.",
                "Among other factors, the static rank of a page is used to determine this prioritization.",
                "A better static rank thus provides the engine with a higher quality, more upto-date index.",
                "Google is often regarded as the first commercially successful search engine.",
                "Their ranking was originally based on the PageRank algorithm [5][27].",
                "Due to this (and possibly due to Googles promotion of PageRank to the public), PageRank is widely regarded as the best method for the static ranking of Web pages.",
                "Though PageRank has historically been thought to perform quite well, there has yet been little academic evidence to support this claim.",
                "Even worse, there has recently been work showing that PageRank may not perform any better than other simple measures on certain tasks.",
                "Upstill et al. have found that for the task of finding home pages, the number of pages linking to a page and the type of URL were as, or more, effective than PageRank [32].",
                "They found similar results for the task of finding high quality companies [31].",
                "PageRank has also been used in systems for TRECs very large collection and Web track competitions, but with much less success than had been expected [17].",
                "Finally, Amento et al. [1] found that simple features, such as the number of pages on a site, performed as well as PageRank.",
                "Despite these, the general belief remains among many, both academic and in the public, that PageRank is an essential factor for a good static rank.",
                "Failing this, it is still assumed that using the link structure is crucial, in the form of the number of inlinks or the amount of anchor text.",
                "In this paper, we show there are a number of simple url- or pagebased features that significantly outperform PageRank (for the purposes of statically ranking Web pages) despite ignoring the structure of the Web.",
                "We combine these and other static features using machine learning to achieve a ranking system that is significantly better than PageRank (in pairwise agreement with human labels).",
                "A machine learning approach for static ranking has other advantages besides the quality of the ranking.",
                "Because the measure consists of many features, it is harder for malicious users to manipulate it (i.e., to raise their pages static rank to an undeserved level through questionable techniques, also known as Web spamming).",
                "This is particularly true if the feature set is not known.",
                "In contrast, a single measure like PageRank can be easier to manipulate because spammers need only concentrate on one goal: how to cause more pages to point to their page.",
                "With an algorithm that learns, a feature that becomes unusable due to spammer manipulation will simply be reduced or removed from the final computation of rank.",
                "This flexibility allows a ranking system to rapidly react to new spamming techniques.",
                "A machine learning approach to static ranking is also able to take advantage of any advances in the machine learning field.",
                "For example, recent work on adversarial classification [12] suggests that it may be possible to explicitly model the Web page spammers (the adversary) actions, adjusting the ranking model in advance of the spammers attempts to circumvent it.",
                "Another example is the elimination of outliers in constructing the model, which helps reduce the effect that unique sites may have on the overall quality of the static rank.",
                "By moving static ranking to a machine learning framework, we not only gain in accuracy, but also gain in the ability to react to spammers actions, to rapidly add new features to the ranking algorithm, and to leverage advances in the rapidly growing field of machine learning.",
                "Finally, we believe there will be significant advantages to using this technique for other domains, such as searching a local hard drive or a corporations intranet.",
                "These are domains where the link structure is particularly weak (or non-existent), but there are other domain-specific features that could be just as powerful.",
                "For example, the author of an intranet page and his/her position in the organization (e.g., CEO, manager, or developer) could provide significant clues as to the importance of that page.",
                "A machine learning approach thus allows rapid development of a good static algorithm in new domains.",
                "This papers contribution is a systematic study of static features, including PageRank, for the purposes of (statically) ranking Web pages.",
                "Previous studies on PageRank typically used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g., the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages).",
                "Also, the performance of PageRank and other static features has typically been evaluated in the context of a complete system for dynamic ranking, or for other tasks such as question answering.",
                "In contrast, we explore the use of PageRank and other features for the direct task of statically ranking Web pages.",
                "We first briefly describe the PageRank algorithm.",
                "In Section 3 we introduce RankNet, the machine learning technique used to combine static features into a final ranking.",

                "PAGERANK The basic idea behind PageRank is simple: a link from a Web page to another can be seen as an endorsement of that page.",

                "Imagine a Web surfer who jumps from Web page to Web page, choosing with uniform probability which link to follow at each step.",
                "In order to reduce the effect of dead-ends or endless cycles the surfer will occasionally jump to a random page with some small probability α, or when on a page with no out-links.",
                "If averaged over a sufficient number of steps, the probability the surfer is on page j at some point in time is given by the formula: ∑∈ + − = ji i iP N jP B F )()1( )( α α (1) Where Fi is the set of pages that page i links to, and Bj is the set of pages that link to page j.",
                "The PageRank score for node j is defined as this probability: PR(j)=P(j).",

                "That is, for each pair of feature vectors <i,j> in the training set, RankNet computes the network outputs oi and oj.",
                "Since vector i is supposed to be ranked higher than vector j, the larger is oj-oi, the larger the cost.",
                "RankNet also allows the pairs in Z to be weighted with a confidence (posed as the probability that the pair satisfies the ordering induced by the ranking function).",
                "In this paper, we used a probability of one for all pairs.",
                "In the next section, we will discuss the features used in our feature vectors, xi. 4.",
                "FEATURES To apply RankNet (or other machine learning techniques) to the ranking problem, we needed to extract a set of features from each page.",
                "We divided our feature set into four, mutually exclusive, categories: page-level (Page), domain-level (Domain), anchor text and inlinks (Anchor), and popularity (Popularity).",
                "We also optionally used the PageRank of a page as a feature.",
                "Below, we describe each of these feature categories in more detail.",
                "PageRank We computed PageRank on a Web graph of 5 billion crawled pages (and 20 billion known URLs linked to by these pages).",
                "This represents a significant portion of the Web, and is approximately the same number of pages as are used by Google, Yahoo, and MSN for their search engines.",
                "Because PageRank is a graph-based algorithm, it is important that it be run on as large a subset of the Web as possible.",
                "Most previous studies on PageRank used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g. the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages) We computed PageRank using the standard value of 0.85 for α.",
                "Popularity Another feature we used is the actual popularity of a Web page, measured as the number of times that it has been visited by users over some period of time.",
                "We have access to such data from users who have installed the MSN toolbar and have opted to provide it to MSN.",
                "The data is aggregated into a count, for each Web page, of the number of users who viewed that page.",
                "Though popularity data is generally unavailable, there are two other sources for it.",
                "The first is from proxy logs.",
                "For example, a university that requires its students to use a proxy has a record of all the pages they have visited while on campus.",
                "Unfortunately, proxy data is quite biased and relatively small.",
                "Another source, internal to search engines, are records of which results their users clicked on.",
                "Such data was used by the search engine Direct Hit, and has recently been explored for dynamic ranking purposes [20].",
                "An advantage of the toolbar data over this is that it contains information about URL visits that are not just the result of a search.",
                "The raw popularity is processed into a number of features such as the number of times a page was viewed and the number of times any page in the domain was viewed.",
                "More details are provided in section 5.5.",
                "Anchor text and inlinks These features are based on the information associated with links to the page in question.",
                "It includes features such as the total amount of text in links pointing to the page (anchor text), the number of unique words in that text, etc.",
                "Page This category consists of features which may be determined by looking at the page (and its URL) alone.",
                "We used only eight, simple features such as the number of words in the body, the frequency of the most common term, etc.",
                "Domain This category contains features that are computed as averages across all pages in the domain.",
                "For example, the average number of outlinks on any page and the average PageRank.",
                "Many of these features have been used by others for ranking Web pages, particularly the anchor and page features.",
                "As mentioned, the evaluation is typically for dynamic ranking, and we wish to evaluate the use of them for static ranking.",
                "Also, to our knowledge, this is the first study on the use of actual page <br>visitation popularity</br> for static ranking.",
                "The closest similar work is on using click-through behavior (that is, which search engine results the users click on) to affect dynamic ranking (see e.g., [20]).",
                "Because we use a wide variety of features to come up with a static ranking, we refer to this as fRank (for feature-based ranking). fRank uses RankNet and the set of features described in this section to learn a ranking function for Web pages.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, fRank was trained with all of the features. 5.",
                "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we will demonstrate that we can out perform PageRank by applying machine learning to a straightforward set of features.",
                "Before the results, we first discuss the data, the performance metric, and the training method. 5.1 Data In order to evaluate the quality of a static ranking, we needed a gold standard defining the correct ordering for a set of pages.",
                "For this, we employed a dataset which contains human judgments for 28000 queries.",
                "For each query, a number of results are manually assigned a rating, from 0 to 4, by human judges.",
                "The rating is meant to be a measure of how relevant the result is for the query, where 0 means poor and 4 means excellent.",
                "There are approximately 500k judgments in all, or an average of 18 ratings per query.",
                "The queries are selected by randomly choosing queries from among those issued to the MSN search engine.",
                "The probability that a query is selected is proportional to its frequency among all 709 of the queries.",
                "As a result, common queries are more likely to be judged than uncommon queries.",
                "As an example of how diverse the queries are, the first four queries in the training set are chef schools, chicagoland speedway, eagles fan club, and Turkish culture.",
                "The documents selected for judging are those that we expected would, on average, be reasonably relevant (for example, the top ten documents returned by MSNs search engine).",
                "This provides significantly more information than randomly selecting documents on the Web, the vast majority of which would be irrelevant to a given query.",
                "Because of this process, the judged pages tend to be of higher quality than the average page on the Web, and tend to be pages that will be returned for common search queries.",
                "This bias is good when evaluating the quality of static ranking for the purposes of index ordering and returning relevant documents.",
                "This is because the most important portion of the index to be well-ordered and relevant is the portion that is frequently returned for search queries.",
                "Because of this bias, however, the results in this paper are not applicable to crawl prioritization.",
                "In order to obtain experimental results on crawl prioritization, we would need ratings on a random sample of Web pages.",
                "To convert the data from query-dependent to query-independent, we simply removed the query, taking the maximum over judgments for a URL that appears in more than one query.",
                "The reasoning behind this is that a page that is relevant for some query and irrelevant for another is probably a decent page and should have a high static rank.",
                "Because we evaluated the pages on queries that occur frequently, our data indicates the correct index ordering, and assigns high value to pages that are likely to be relevant to a common query.",
                "We randomly assigned queries to a training, validation, or test set, such that they contained 84%, 8%, and 8% of the queries, respectively.",
                "Each set contains all of the ratings for a given query, and no query appears in more than one set.",
                "The training set was used to train fRank.",
                "The validation set was used to select the model that had the highest performance.",
                "The test set was used for the final results.",
                "This data gives us a query-independent ordering of pages.",
                "The goal for a static ranking algorithm will be to reproduce this ordering as closely as possible.",
                "In the next section, we describe the measure we used to evaluate this. 5.2 Measure We chose to use pairwise accuracy to evaluate the quality of a static ranking.",
                "The pairwise accuracy is the fraction of time that the ranking algorithm and human judges agree on the ordering of a pair of Web pages.",
                "If S(x) is the static ranking assigned to page x, and H(x) is the human judgment of relevance for x, then consider the following sets: )}()(:,{ yHxHyx >=pH and )}()(:,{ ySxSyx >=pS The pairwise accuracy is the portion of Hp that is also contained in Sp: p pp H SH ∩ =accuracypairwise This measure was chosen for two reasons.",
                "First, the discrete human judgments provide only a partial ordering over Web pages, making it difficult to apply a measure such as the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (in the pairwise accuracy measure, a pair of documents with the same human judgment does not affect the score).",
                "Second, the pairwise accuracy has an intuitive meaning: it is the fraction of pairs of documents that, when the humans claim one is better than the other, the static rank algorithm orders them correctly. 5.3 Method We trained fRank (a RankNet based neural network) using the following parameters.",
                "We used a fully connected 2 layer network.",
                "The hidden layer had 10 hidden nodes.",
                "The input weights to this layer were all initialized to be zero.",
                "The output layer (just a single node) weights were initialized using a uniform random distribution in the range [-0.1, 0.1].",
                "We used tanh as the transfer function from the inputs to the hidden layer, and a linear function from the hidden layer to the output.",
                "The cost function is the pairwise cross entropy cost function as discussed in section 3.",
                "The features in the training set were normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.",
                "The same linear transformation was then applied to the features in the validation and test sets.",
                "For training, we presented the network with 5 million pairings of pages, where one page had a higher rating than the other.",
                "The pairings were chosen uniformly at random (with replacement) from all possible pairings.",
                "When forming the pairs, we ignored the magnitude of the difference between the ratings (the rating spread) for the two URLs.",
                "Hence, the weight for each pair was constant (one), and the probability of a pair being selected was independent of its rating spread.",
                "We trained the network for 30 epochs.",
                "On each epoch, the training pairs were randomly shuffled.",
                "The initial training rate was 0.001.",
                "At each epoch, we checked the error on the training set.",
                "If the error had increased, then we decreased the training rate, under the hypothesis that the network had probably overshot.",
                "The training rate at each epoch was thus set to: Training rate = 1+ε κ Where κ is the initial rate (0.001), and ε is the number of times the training set error has increased.",
                "After each epoch, we measured the performance of the neural network on the validation set, using 1 million pairs (chosen randomly with replacement).",
                "The network with the highest pairwise accuracy on the validation set was selected, and then tested on the test set.",
                "We report the pairwise accuracy on the test set, calculated using all possible pairs.",
                "These parameters were determined and fixed before the static rank experiments in this paper.",
                "In particular, the choice of initial training rate, number of epochs, and training rate decay function were taken directly from Burges et al [7].",
                "Though we had the option of preprocessing any of the features before they were input to the neural network, we refrained from doing so on most of them.",
                "The only exception was the popularity features.",
                "As with most Web phenomenon, we found that the distribution of site popularity is Zipfian.",
                "To reduce the dynamic range, and hopefully make the feature more useful, we presented the network with both the unpreprocessed, as well as the logarithm, of the popularity features (As with the others, the logarithmic feature values were also normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation). 710 Applying fRank to a document is computationally efficient, taking time that is only linear in the number of input features; it is thus within a constant factor of other simple machine learning methods such as naïve Bayes.",
                "In our experiments, computing the fRank for all five billion Web pages was approximately 100 times faster than computing the PageRank for the same set. 5.4 Results As Table 1 shows, fRank significantly outperforms PageRank for the purposes of static ranking.",
                "With a pairwise accuracy of 67.4%, fRank more than doubles the accuracy of PageRank (relative to the baseline of 50%, which is the accuracy that would be achieved by a random ordering of Web pages).",
                "Note that one of fRanks input features is the PageRank of the page, so we would expect it to perform no worse than PageRank.",
                "The significant increase in accuracy implies that the other features (anchor, popularity, etc.) do in fact contain useful information regarding the overall quality of a page.",
                "Table 1: Basic Results Technique Accuracy (%) None (Baseline) 50.00 PageRank 56.70 fRank 67.43 There are a number of decisions that go into the computation of PageRank, such as how to deal with pages that have no outlinks, the choice of α, numeric precision, convergence threshold, etc.",
                "We were able to obtain a computation of PageRank from a completely independent implementation (provided by Marc Najork) that varied somewhat in these parameters.",
                "It achieved a pairwise accuracy of 56.52%, nearly identical to that obtained by our implementation.",
                "We thus concluded that the quality of the PageRank is not sensitive to these minor variations in algorithm, nor was PageRanks low accuracy due to problems with our implementation of it.",
                "We also wanted to find how well each feature set performed.",
                "To answer this, for each feature set, we trained and tested fRank using only that set of features.",
                "The results are shown in Table 2.",
                "As can be seen, every single feature set individually outperformed PageRank on this test.",
                "Perhaps the most interesting result is that the Page-level features had the highest performance out of all the feature sets.",
                "This is surprising because these are features that do not depend on the overall graph structure of the Web, nor even on what pages point to a given page.",
                "This is contrary to the common belief that the Web graph structure is the key to finding a good static ranking of Web pages.",

                "This means that a particular feature that appears to have little value in isolation could actually be very important when used in combination with other features.",

                "One fix for this is to add information about the link to the PageRank computation, such as the size of the text, whether it was at the bottom of the page, etc.",
                "The other bias comes from the fact that the population of Web site authors is different than the population of Web users.",
                "Web authors tend to be technologically-oriented, and thus their linking behavior reflects those interests. fRank, by knowing the actual <br>visitation popularity</br> of a site (the popularity feature set), is able to eliminate some of that bias.",

                "The toolbar provides information about which Web pages people find interesting right now, whereas links are added to pages more slowly, as authors find the time and interest. 6.",
                "RELATED AND FUTURE WORK 6.1 Improvements to PageRank Since the original PageRank paper, there has been work on improving it.",
                "Much of that work centers on speeding up and parallelizing the computation [15][25].",
                "One recognized problem with PageRank is that of topic drift: A page about dogs will have high PageRank if it is linked to by many pages that themselves have high rank, regardless of their topic.",
                "In contrast, a search engine user looking for good pages about dogs would likely prefer to find pages that are pointed to by many pages that are themselves about dogs.",
                "Hence, a link that is on topic should have higher weight than a link that is not.",
                "Richardson and Domingoss Query Dependent PageRank [29] and Haveliwalas Topic-Sensitive PageRank [16] are two approaches that tackle this problem.",
                "Other variations to PageRank include differently weighting links for inter- vs. intra-domain links, adding a backwards step to the random surfer to simulate the back button on most browsers [24] and modifying the jump probability (α) [3].",
                "See Langville and Meyer [23] for a good survey of these, and other modifications to PageRank. 6.2 Other related work PageRank is not the only link analysis algorithm used for ranking Web pages.",
                "The most well-known other is HITS [22], which is used by the Teoma search engine [30].",
                "HITS produces a list of hubs and authorities, where hubs are pages that point to many authority pages, and authorities are pages that are pointed to by many hubs.",
                "Previous work has shown HITS to perform comparably to PageRank [1].",
                "One field of interest is that of static index pruning (see e.g., Carmel et al. [8]).",
                "Static index pruning methods reduce the size of the search engines index by removing documents that are unlikely to be returned by a search query.",
                "The pruning is typically done based on the frequency of query terms.",
                "Similarly, Pandey and Olston [28] suggest crawling pages frequently if they are likely to incorrectly appear (or not appear) as a result of a search.",
                "Similar methods could be incorporated into the static rank (e.g., how many frequent queries contain words found on this page).",
                "Others have investigated the effect that PageRank has on the Web at large [9].",
                "They argue that pages with high PageRank are more likely to be found by Web users, thus more likely to be linked to, and thus more likely to maintain a higher PageRank than other pages.",
                "The same may occur for the popularity data.",
                "If we increase the ranking for popular pages, they are more likely to be clicked on, thus further increasing their popularity.",
                "Cho et al. [10] argue that a more appropriate measure of Web page quality would depend on not only the current link structure of the Web, but also on the change in that link structure.",
                "The same technique may be applicable to popularity data: the change in popularity of a page may be more informative than the absolute popularity.",
                "One interesting related work is that of Ivory and Hearst [19].",
                "Their goal was to build a model of Web sites that are considered high quality from the perspective of content, structure and navigation, visual design, functionality, interactivity, and overall experience.",
                "They used over 100 page level features, as well as features encompassing the performance and structure of the site.",
                "This let them qualitatively describe the qualities of a page that make it appear attractive (e.g., rare use of italics, at least 9 point font, …), and (in later work) to build a system that assists novel Web page authors in creating quality pages by evaluating it according to these features.",
                "The primary differences between this work and ours are the goal (discovering what constitutes a good Web page vs. ordering Web pages for the purposes of Web search), the size of the study (they used a dataset of less than 6000 pages vs. our set of 468,000), and our comparison with PageRank. y = 0.577Ln(x) + 58.283 R 2 = 0.9822 58 58.5 59 59.5 60 60.5 61 1 10 100 Days of Toolbar Data PairwiseAccuracy Figure 1: Relation between the amount of popularity data and the performance of the popularity feature set.",

                "Recent work on incorporating novel features into dynamic ranking includes that by Joachims et al. [21], who investigate the use of implicit feedback from users, in the form of which search engine results are clicked on.",
                "Craswell et al. [11] present a method for determining the best transformation to apply to query independent features (such as those used in this paper) for the purposes of improving dynamic ranking.",
                "Other work, such as Boyan et al. [4] and Bartell et al. [2] apply machine learning for the purposes of improving the overall relevance of a search engine (i.e., the dynamic ranking).",
                "They do not apply their techniques to the problem of static ranking. 6.3 Future work There are many ways in which we would like to extend this work.",
                "First, fRank uses only a small number of features.",
                "We believe we could achieve even more significant results with more features.",
                "In particular the existence, or lack thereof, of certain words could prove very significant (for instance, under construction probably signifies a low quality page).",
                "Other features could include the number of images on a page, size of those images, number of layout elements (tables, divs, and spans), use of style sheets, conforming to W3C standards (like XHTML 1.0 Strict), background color of a page, etc.",
                "Many pages are generated dynamically, the contents of which may depend on parameters in the URL, the time of day, the user visiting the site, or other variables.",
                "For such pages, it may be useful to apply the techniques found in [26] to form a static approximation for the purposes of extracting features.",
                "The resulting grammar describing the page could itself be a source of additional features describing the complexity of the page, such as how many non-terminal nodes it has, the depth of the grammar tree, etc. fRank allows one to specify a confidence in each pairing of documents.",
                "In the future, we will experiment with probabilities that depend on the difference in human judgments between the two items in the pair.",
                "For example, a pair of documents where one was rated 4 and the other 0 should have a higher confidence than a pair of documents rated 3 and 2.",
                "The experiments in this paper are biased toward pages that have higher than average quality.",
                "Also, fRank with all of the features can only be applied to pages that have already been crawled.",
                "Thus, fRank is primarily useful for index ordering and improving relevance, not for directing the crawl.",
                "We would like to investigate a machine learning approach for crawl prioritization as well.",
                "It may be that a combination of methods is best: for example, using PageRank to select the best 5 billion of the 20 billion pages on the Web, then using fRank to order the index and affect search relevancy.",
                "Another interesting direction for exploration is to incorporate fRank and page-level features directly into the PageRank computation itself.",
                "Work on biasing the PageRank jump vector [16], and transition matrix [29], have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of such an approach.",
                "There is reason to believe that a direct application of [29], using the fRank of a page for its relevance, could lead to an improved overall static rank.",
                "Finally, the popularity data can be used in other interesting ways.",
                "The general surfing and searching habits of Web users varies by time of day.",
                "Activity in the morning, daytime, and evening are often quite different (e.g., reading the news, solving problems, and accessing entertainment, respectively).",
                "We can gain insight into these differences by using the popularity data, divided into segments of the day.",
                "When a query is issued, we would then use the popularity data matching the time of query in order to do the ranking of Web pages.",
                "We also plan to explore popularity features that use more than just the counts of how often a page was visited.",
                "For example, how long users tended to dwell on a page, did they leave the page by clicking a link or by hitting the back button, etc.",
                "Fox et al. did a study that showed that features such as this can be valuable for the purposes of dynamic ranking [14].",
                "Finally, the popularity data could be used as the label rather than as a feature.",
                "Using fRank in this way to predict the popularity of a page may useful for the tasks of relevance, efficiency, and crawl priority.",
                "There is also significantly more popularity data than human labeled data, potentially enabling more complex machine learning methods, and significantly more features. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS A good static ranking is an important component for todays search engines and information retrieval systems.",
                "We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank.",
                "By combining many static features, fRank achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise accuracy than PageRank alone.",
                "A qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that Web users, rather than Web authors, visit.",
                "The machine learning component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further developments in the machine learning community in areas such as adversarial classification.",
                "We have only begun to explore the options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the area of static ranking by further experimentation with additional features, other machine learning techniques, and additional sources of data. 8.",

                "The number of incorrect, spamming, and malicious (e.g., phishing) sites has also grown rapidly.",
                "The sheer number of both good and bad pages on the Web has led to an increasing reliance on search engines for the discovery of useful information.",
                "Users rely on search engines not only to return pages related to their search query, but also to separate the good from the bad, and order results so that the best pages are suggested first.",

                "The queries are selected by randomly choosing queries from among those issued to the MSN search engine.",
                "The probability that a query is selected is proportional to its frequency among all 709 of the queries.",
                "As a result, common queries are more likely to be judged than uncommon queries.",
                "As an example of how diverse the queries are, the first four queries in the training set are chef schools, chicagoland speedway, eagles fan club, and Turkish culture.",
                "The documents selected for judging are those that we expected would, on average, be reasonably relevant (for example, the top ten documents returned by MSNs search engine).",
                "This provides significantly more information than randomly selecting documents on the Web, the vast majority of which would be irrelevant to a given query.",
                "Because of this process, the judged pages tend to be of higher quality than the average page on the Web, and tend to be pages that will be returned for common search queries.",
                "This bias is good when evaluating the quality of static ranking for the purposes of index ordering and returning relevant documents.",
                "This is because the most important portion of the index to be well-ordered and relevant is the portion that is frequently returned for search queries.",
                "Because of this bias, however, the results in this paper are not applicable to crawl prioritization.",
                "In order to obtain experimental results on crawl prioritization, we would need ratings on a random sample of Web pages.",
                "To convert the data from query-dependent to query-independent, we simply removed the query, taking the maximum over judgments for a URL that appears in more than one query.",
                "The reasoning behind this is that a page that is relevant for some query and irrelevant for another is probably a decent page and should have a high <br>static rank</br>.",
                "Because we evaluated the pages on queries that occur frequently, our data indicates the correct index ordering, and assigns high value to pages that are likely to be relevant to a common query.",

                "In the next section, we describe the measure we used to evaluate this. 5.2 Measure We chose to use pairwise accuracy to evaluate the quality of a static ranking.",
                "The pairwise accuracy is the fraction of time that the ranking algorithm and human judges agree on the ordering of a pair of Web pages.",
                "If S(x) is the static ranking assigned to page x, and H(x) is the human judgment of relevance for x, then consider the following sets: )}()(:,{ yHxHyx >=pH and )}()(:,{ ySxSyx >=pS The pairwise accuracy is the portion of Hp that is also contained in Sp: p pp H SH ∩ =accuracypairwise This measure was chosen for two reasons.",
                "First, the discrete human judgments provide only a partial ordering over Web pages, making it difficult to apply a measure such as the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (in the pairwise accuracy measure, a pair of documents with the same human judgment does not affect the score).",
                "Second, the pairwise accuracy has an intuitive meaning: it is the fraction of pairs of documents that, when the humans claim one is better than the other, the <br>static rank</br> algorithm orders them correctly. 5.3 Method We trained fRank (a RankNet based neural network) using the following parameters.",
                "We used a fully connected 2 layer network.",
                "The hidden layer had 10 hidden nodes.",
                "The input weights to this layer were all initialized to be zero.",

                "We used tanh as the transfer function from the inputs to the hidden layer, and a linear function from the hidden layer to the output.",
                "The cost function is the pairwise cross entropy cost function as discussed in section 3.",
                "The features in the training set were normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.",
                "The same linear transformation was then applied to the features in the validation and test sets.",
                "For training, we presented the network with 5 million pairings of pages, where one page had a higher rating than the other.",
                "The pairings were chosen uniformly at random (with replacement) from all possible pairings.",
                "When forming the pairs, we ignored the magnitude of the difference between the ratings (the rating spread) for the two URLs.",
                "Hence, the weight for each pair was constant (one), and the probability of a pair being selected was independent of its rating spread.",
                "We trained the network for 30 epochs.",
                "On each epoch, the training pairs were randomly shuffled.",
                "The initial training rate was 0.001.",
                "At each epoch, we checked the error on the training set.",
                "If the error had increased, then we decreased the training rate, under the hypothesis that the network had probably overshot.",
                "The training rate at each epoch was thus set to: Training rate = 1+ε κ Where κ is the initial rate (0.001), and ε is the number of times the training set error has increased.",
                "After each epoch, we measured the performance of the neural network on the validation set, using 1 million pairs (chosen randomly with replacement).",
                "The network with the highest pairwise accuracy on the validation set was selected, and then tested on the test set.",
                "We report the pairwise accuracy on the test set, calculated using all possible pairs.",
                "These parameters were determined and fixed before the <br>static rank</br> experiments in this paper.",
                "In particular, the choice of initial training rate, number of epochs, and training rate decay function were taken directly from Burges et al [7].",
                "Though we had the option of preprocessing any of the features before they were input to the neural network, we refrained from doing so on most of them.",
                "The only exception was the popularity features.",
                "As with most Web phenomenon, we found that the distribution of site popularity is Zipfian.",
                "To reduce the dynamic range, and hopefully make the feature more useful, we presented the network with both the unpreprocessed, as well as the logarithm, of the popularity features (As with the others, the logarithmic feature values were also normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation). 710 Applying fRank to a document is computationally efficient, taking time that is only linear in the number of input features; it is thus within a constant factor of other simple machine learning methods such as naïve Bayes.",
                "In our experiments, computing the fRank for all five billion Web pages was approximately 100 times faster than computing the PageRank for the same set. 5.4 Results As Table 1 shows, fRank significantly outperforms PageRank for the purposes of static ranking.",
                "With a pairwise accuracy of 67.4%, fRank more than doubles the accuracy of PageRank (relative to the baseline of 50%, which is the accuracy that would be achieved by a random ordering of Web pages).",
                "Note that one of fRanks input features is the PageRank of the page, so we would expect it to perform no worse than PageRank.",
                "The significant increase in accuracy implies that the other features (anchor, popularity, etc.) do in fact contain useful information regarding the overall quality of a page.",
                "Table 1: Basic Results Technique Accuracy (%) None (Baseline) 50.00 PageRank 56.70 fRank 67.43 There are a number of decisions that go into the computation of PageRank, such as how to deal with pages that have no outlinks, the choice of α, numeric precision, convergence threshold, etc.",

                "It achieved a pairwise accuracy of 56.52%, nearly identical to that obtained by our implementation.",
                "We thus concluded that the quality of the PageRank is not sensitive to these minor variations in algorithm, nor was PageRanks low accuracy due to problems with our implementation of it.",
                "We also wanted to find how well each feature set performed.",
                "To answer this, for each feature set, we trained and tested fRank using only that set of features.",
                "The results are shown in Table 2.",
                "As can be seen, every single feature set individually outperformed PageRank on this test.",
                "Perhaps the most interesting result is that the Page-level features had the highest performance out of all the feature sets.",
                "This is surprising because these are features that do not depend on the overall graph structure of the Web, nor even on what pages point to a given page.",

                "The toolbar provides information about which Web pages people find interesting right now, whereas links are added to pages more slowly, as authors find the time and interest. 6.",
                "RELATED AND FUTURE WORK 6.1 Improvements to PageRank Since the original PageRank paper, there has been work on improving it.",
                "Much of that work centers on speeding up and parallelizing the computation [15][25].",
                "One recognized problem with PageRank is that of topic drift: A page about dogs will have high PageRank if it is linked to by many pages that themselves have high rank, regardless of their topic.",
                "In contrast, a search engine user looking for good pages about dogs would likely prefer to find pages that are pointed to by many pages that are themselves about dogs.",
                "Hence, a link that is on topic should have higher weight than a link that is not.",
                "Richardson and Domingoss Query Dependent PageRank [29] and Haveliwalas Topic-Sensitive PageRank [16] are two approaches that tackle this problem.",
                "Other variations to PageRank include differently weighting links for inter- vs. intra-domain links, adding a backwards step to the random surfer to simulate the back button on most browsers [24] and modifying the jump probability (α) [3].",
                "See Langville and Meyer [23] for a good survey of these, and other modifications to PageRank. 6.2 Other related work PageRank is not the only link analysis algorithm used for ranking Web pages.",

                "One field of interest is that of static index pruning (see e.g., Carmel et al. [8]).",

                "They do not apply their techniques to the problem of static ranking. 6.3 Future work There are many ways in which we would like to extend this work.",
                "First, fRank uses only a small number of features.",
                "We believe we could achieve even more significant results with more features.",
                "In particular the existence, or lack thereof, of certain words could prove very significant (for instance, under construction probably signifies a low quality page).",
                "Other features could include the number of images on a page, size of those images, number of layout elements (tables, divs, and spans), use of style sheets, conforming to W3C standards (like XHTML 1.0 Strict), background color of a page, etc.",
                "Many pages are generated dynamically, the contents of which may depend on parameters in the URL, the time of day, the user visiting the site, or other variables.",
                "For such pages, it may be useful to apply the techniques found in [26] to form a static approximation for the purposes of extracting features.",
                "The resulting grammar describing the page could itself be a source of additional features describing the complexity of the page, such as how many non-terminal nodes it has, the depth of the grammar tree, etc. fRank allows one to specify a confidence in each pairing of documents.",
                "In the future, we will experiment with probabilities that depend on the difference in human judgments between the two items in the pair.",
                "For example, a pair of documents where one was rated 4 and the other 0 should have a higher confidence than a pair of documents rated 3 and 2.",
                "The experiments in this paper are biased toward pages that have higher than average quality.",
                "Also, fRank with all of the features can only be applied to pages that have already been crawled.",
                "Thus, fRank is primarily useful for index ordering and improving relevance, not for directing the crawl.",
                "We would like to investigate a machine learning approach for crawl prioritization as well.",
                "It may be that a combination of methods is best: for example, using PageRank to select the best 5 billion of the 20 billion pages on the Web, then using fRank to order the index and affect search relevancy.",
                "Another interesting direction for exploration is to incorporate fRank and page-level features directly into the PageRank computation itself.",
                "Work on biasing the PageRank jump vector [16], and transition matrix [29], have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of such an approach.",
                "There is reason to believe that a direct application of [29], using the fRank of a page for its relevance, could lead to an improved overall <br>static rank</br>.",
                "Finally, the popularity data can be used in other interesting ways.",
                "The general surfing and searching habits of Web users varies by time of day.",
                "Activity in the morning, daytime, and evening are often quite different (e.g., reading the news, solving problems, and accessing entertainment, respectively).",
                "We can gain insight into these differences by using the popularity data, divided into segments of the day.",
                "When a query is issued, we would then use the popularity data matching the time of query in order to do the ranking of Web pages.",
                "We also plan to explore popularity features that use more than just the counts of how often a page was visited.",
                "For example, how long users tended to dwell on a page, did they leave the page by clicking a link or by hitting the back button, etc.",
                "Fox et al. did a study that showed that features such as this can be valuable for the purposes of dynamic ranking [14].",
                "Finally, the popularity data could be used as the label rather than as a feature.",
                "Using fRank in this way to predict the popularity of a page may useful for the tasks of relevance, efficiency, and crawl priority.",
                "There is also significantly more popularity data than human labeled data, potentially enabling more complex machine learning methods, and significantly more features. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS A good static ranking is an important component for todays search engines and information retrieval systems.",
                "We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank.",
                "By combining many static features, fRank achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise accuracy than PageRank alone.",
                "A qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that Web users, rather than Web authors, visit.",
                "The machine learning component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further developments in the machine learning community in areas such as adversarial classification.",
                "We have only begun to explore the options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the area of static ranking by further experimentation with additional features, other machine learning techniques, and additional sources of data. 8.",

                "INTRODUCTION Over the past decade, the Web has grown exponentially in size.",
                "Unfortunately, this growth has not been isolated to good-quality pages.",
                "The number of incorrect, spamming, and malicious (e.g., phishing) sites has also grown rapidly.",
                "The sheer number of both good and bad pages on the Web has led to an increasing reliance on search engines for the discovery of useful information.",
                "Users rely on search engines not only to return pages related to their search query, but also to separate the good from the bad, and order results so that the best pages are suggested first.",
                "To date, most work on Web page ranking has focused on improving the ordering of the results returned to the user (querydependent ranking, or dynamic ranking).",
                "However, having a good query-independent ranking (static ranking) is also crucially important for a <br>search engine</br>.",
                "A good static ranking algorithm provides numerous benefits: • Relevance: The static rank of a page provides a general indicator to the overall quality of the page.",
                "This is a useful input to the dynamic ranking algorithm. • Efficiency: Typically, the search engines index is ordered by static rank.",
                "By traversing the index from highquality to low-quality pages, the dynamic ranker may abort the search when it determines that no later page will have as high of a dynamic rank as those already found.",
                "The more accurate the static rank, the better this early-stopping ability, and hence the quicker the <br>search engine</br> may respond to queries. • Crawl Priority: The Web grows and changes as quickly as search engines can crawl it.",
                "Search engines need a way to prioritize their crawl-to determine which pages to recrawl, how frequently, and how often to seek out new pages.",
                "Among other factors, the static rank of a page is used to determine this prioritization.",
                "A better static rank thus provides the engine with a higher quality, more upto-date index.",
                "Google is often regarded as the first commercially successful <br>search engine</br>.",
                "Their ranking was originally based on the PageRank algorithm [5][27].",
                "Due to this (and possibly due to Googles promotion of PageRank to the public), PageRank is widely regarded as the best method for the static ranking of Web pages.",
                "Though PageRank has historically been thought to perform quite well, there has yet been little academic evidence to support this claim.",
                "Even worse, there has recently been work showing that PageRank may not perform any better than other simple measures on certain tasks.",
                "Upstill et al. have found that for the task of finding home pages, the number of pages linking to a page and the type of URL were as, or more, effective than PageRank [32].",
                "They found similar results for the task of finding high quality companies [31].",
                "PageRank has also been used in systems for TRECs very large collection and Web track competitions, but with much less success than had been expected [17].",
                "Finally, Amento et al. [1] found that simple features, such as the number of pages on a site, performed as well as PageRank.",
                "Despite these, the general belief remains among many, both academic and in the public, that PageRank is an essential factor for a good static rank.",
                "Failing this, it is still assumed that using the link structure is crucial, in the form of the number of inlinks or the amount of anchor text.",
                "In this paper, we show there are a number of simple url- or pagebased features that significantly outperform PageRank (for the purposes of statically ranking Web pages) despite ignoring the structure of the Web.",
                "We combine these and other static features using machine learning to achieve a ranking system that is significantly better than PageRank (in pairwise agreement with human labels).",
                "A machine learning approach for static ranking has other advantages besides the quality of the ranking.",
                "Because the measure consists of many features, it is harder for malicious users to manipulate it (i.e., to raise their pages static rank to an undeserved level through questionable techniques, also known as Web spamming).",
                "This is particularly true if the feature set is not known.",
                "In contrast, a single measure like PageRank can be easier to manipulate because spammers need only concentrate on one goal: how to cause more pages to point to their page.",
                "With an algorithm that learns, a feature that becomes unusable due to spammer manipulation will simply be reduced or removed from the final computation of rank.",
                "This flexibility allows a ranking system to rapidly react to new spamming techniques.",
                "A machine learning approach to static ranking is also able to take advantage of any advances in the machine learning field.",
                "For example, recent work on adversarial classification [12] suggests that it may be possible to explicitly model the Web page spammers (the adversary) actions, adjusting the ranking model in advance of the spammers attempts to circumvent it.",
                "Another example is the elimination of outliers in constructing the model, which helps reduce the effect that unique sites may have on the overall quality of the static rank.",
                "By moving static ranking to a machine learning framework, we not only gain in accuracy, but also gain in the ability to react to spammers actions, to rapidly add new features to the ranking algorithm, and to leverage advances in the rapidly growing field of machine learning.",
                "Finally, we believe there will be significant advantages to using this technique for other domains, such as searching a local hard drive or a corporations intranet.",
                "These are domains where the link structure is particularly weak (or non-existent), but there are other domain-specific features that could be just as powerful.",
                "For example, the author of an intranet page and his/her position in the organization (e.g., CEO, manager, or developer) could provide significant clues as to the importance of that page.",
                "A machine learning approach thus allows rapid development of a good static algorithm in new domains.",
                "This papers contribution is a systematic study of static features, including PageRank, for the purposes of (statically) ranking Web pages.",
                "Previous studies on PageRank typically used subsets of the Web that are significantly smaller (e.g., the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by many, contains only 19 million pages).",
                "Also, the performance of PageRank and other static features has typically been evaluated in the context of a complete system for dynamic ranking, or for other tasks such as question answering.",
                "In contrast, we explore the use of PageRank and other features for the direct task of statically ranking Web pages.",
                "We first briefly describe the PageRank algorithm.",
                "In Section 3 we introduce RankNet, the machine learning technique used to combine static features into a final ranking.",
                "Section 4 describes the static features.",
                "The heart of the paper is in Section 5, which presents our experiments and results.",

                "PAGERANK The basic idea behind PageRank is simple: a link from a Web page to another can be seen as an endorsement of that page.",
                "In general, links are made by people.",
                "As such, they are indicative of the quality of the pages to which they point - when creating a page, an author presumably chooses to link to pages deemed to be of good quality.",
                "We can take advantage of this linkage information to order Web pages according to their perceived quality.",
                "Imagine a Web surfer who jumps from Web page to Web page, choosing with uniform probability which link to follow at each step.",
                "In order to reduce the effect of dead-ends or endless cycles the surfer will occasionally jump to a random page with some small probability α, or when on a page with no out-links.",
                "If averaged over a sufficient number of steps, the probability the surfer is on page j at some point in time is given by the formula: ∑∈ + − = ji i iP N jP B F )()1( )( α α (1) Where Fi is the set of pages that page i links to, and Bj is the set of pages that link to page j.",
                "The PageRank score for node j is defined as this probability: PR(j)=P(j).",
                "Because equation (1) is recursive, it must be iteratively evaluated until P(j) converges (typically, the initial distribution for P(j) is uniform).",
                "The intuition is, because a random surfer would end up at the page more frequently, it is likely a better page.",
                "An alternative view for equation (1) is that each page is assigned a quality, P(j).",

                "As mentioned, the evaluation is typically for dynamic ranking, and we wish to evaluate the use of them for static ranking.",
                "Also, to our knowledge, this is the first study on the use of actual page visitation popularity for static ranking.",
                "The closest similar work is on using click-through behavior (that is, which <br>search engine</br> results the users click on) to affect dynamic ranking (see e.g., [20]).",
                "Because we use a wide variety of features to come up with a static ranking, we refer to this as fRank (for feature-based ranking). fRank uses RankNet and the set of features described in this section to learn a ranking function for Web pages.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, fRank was trained with all of the features. 5.",
                "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we will demonstrate that we can out perform PageRank by applying machine learning to a straightforward set of features.",
                "Before the results, we first discuss the data, the performance metric, and the training method. 5.1 Data In order to evaluate the quality of a static ranking, we needed a gold standard defining the correct ordering for a set of pages.",
                "For this, we employed a dataset which contains human judgments for 28000 queries.",
                "For each query, a number of results are manually assigned a rating, from 0 to 4, by human judges.",
                "The rating is meant to be a measure of how relevant the result is for the query, where 0 means poor and 4 means excellent.",
                "There are approximately 500k judgments in all, or an average of 18 ratings per query.",
                "The queries are selected by randomly choosing queries from among those issued to the MSN <br>search engine</br>.",
                "The probability that a query is selected is proportional to its frequency among all 709 of the queries.",
                "As a result, common queries are more likely to be judged than uncommon queries.",
                "As an example of how diverse the queries are, the first four queries in the training set are chef schools, chicagoland speedway, eagles fan club, and Turkish culture.",
                "The documents selected for judging are those that we expected would, on average, be reasonably relevant (for example, the top ten documents returned by MSNs <br>search engine</br>).",
                "This provides significantly more information than randomly selecting documents on the Web, the vast majority of which would be irrelevant to a given query.",
                "Because of this process, the judged pages tend to be of higher quality than the average page on the Web, and tend to be pages that will be returned for common search queries.",
                "This bias is good when evaluating the quality of static ranking for the purposes of index ordering and returning relevant documents.",
                "This is because the most important portion of the index to be well-ordered and relevant is the portion that is frequently returned for search queries.",
                "Because of this bias, however, the results in this paper are not applicable to crawl prioritization.",
                "In order to obtain experimental results on crawl prioritization, we would need ratings on a random sample of Web pages.",
                "To convert the data from query-dependent to query-independent, we simply removed the query, taking the maximum over judgments for a URL that appears in more than one query.",
                "The reasoning behind this is that a page that is relevant for some query and irrelevant for another is probably a decent page and should have a high static rank.",
                "Because we evaluated the pages on queries that occur frequently, our data indicates the correct index ordering, and assigns high value to pages that are likely to be relevant to a common query.",
                "We randomly assigned queries to a training, validation, or test set, such that they contained 84%, 8%, and 8% of the queries, respectively.",
                "Each set contains all of the ratings for a given query, and no query appears in more than one set.",
                "The training set was used to train fRank.",
                "The validation set was used to select the model that had the highest performance.",
                "The test set was used for the final results.",
                "This data gives us a query-independent ordering of pages.",
                "The goal for a static ranking algorithm will be to reproduce this ordering as closely as possible.",
                "In the next section, we describe the measure we used to evaluate this. 5.2 Measure We chose to use pairwise accuracy to evaluate the quality of a static ranking.",
                "The pairwise accuracy is the fraction of time that the ranking algorithm and human judges agree on the ordering of a pair of Web pages.",
                "If S(x) is the static ranking assigned to page x, and H(x) is the human judgment of relevance for x, then consider the following sets: )}()(:,{ yHxHyx >=pH and )}()(:,{ ySxSyx >=pS The pairwise accuracy is the portion of Hp that is also contained in Sp: p pp H SH ∩ =accuracypairwise This measure was chosen for two reasons.",
                "First, the discrete human judgments provide only a partial ordering over Web pages, making it difficult to apply a measure such as the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (in the pairwise accuracy measure, a pair of documents with the same human judgment does not affect the score).",
                "Second, the pairwise accuracy has an intuitive meaning: it is the fraction of pairs of documents that, when the humans claim one is better than the other, the static rank algorithm orders them correctly. 5.3 Method We trained fRank (a RankNet based neural network) using the following parameters.",
                "We used a fully connected 2 layer network.",
                "The hidden layer had 10 hidden nodes.",
                "The input weights to this layer were all initialized to be zero.",
                "The output layer (just a single node) weights were initialized using a uniform random distribution in the range [-0.1, 0.1].",
                "We used tanh as the transfer function from the inputs to the hidden layer, and a linear function from the hidden layer to the output.",
                "The cost function is the pairwise cross entropy cost function as discussed in section 3.",
                "The features in the training set were normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.",
                "The same linear transformation was then applied to the features in the validation and test sets.",
                "For training, we presented the network with 5 million pairings of pages, where one page had a higher rating than the other.",
                "The pairings were chosen uniformly at random (with replacement) from all possible pairings.",
                "When forming the pairs, we ignored the magnitude of the difference between the ratings (the rating spread) for the two URLs.",
                "Hence, the weight for each pair was constant (one), and the probability of a pair being selected was independent of its rating spread.",
                "We trained the network for 30 epochs.",
                "On each epoch, the training pairs were randomly shuffled.",
                "The initial training rate was 0.001.",
                "At each epoch, we checked the error on the training set.",
                "If the error had increased, then we decreased the training rate, under the hypothesis that the network had probably overshot.",
                "The training rate at each epoch was thus set to: Training rate = 1+ε κ Where κ is the initial rate (0.001), and ε is the number of times the training set error has increased.",
                "After each epoch, we measured the performance of the neural network on the validation set, using 1 million pairs (chosen randomly with replacement).",
                "The network with the highest pairwise accuracy on the validation set was selected, and then tested on the test set.",
                "We report the pairwise accuracy on the test set, calculated using all possible pairs.",
                "These parameters were determined and fixed before the static rank experiments in this paper.",
                "In particular, the choice of initial training rate, number of epochs, and training rate decay function were taken directly from Burges et al [7].",
                "Though we had the option of preprocessing any of the features before they were input to the neural network, we refrained from doing so on most of them.",
                "The only exception was the popularity features.",
                "As with most Web phenomenon, we found that the distribution of site popularity is Zipfian.",
                "To reduce the dynamic range, and hopefully make the feature more useful, we presented the network with both the unpreprocessed, as well as the logarithm, of the popularity features (As with the others, the logarithmic feature values were also normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation). 710 Applying fRank to a document is computationally efficient, taking time that is only linear in the number of input features; it is thus within a constant factor of other simple machine learning methods such as naïve Bayes.",
                "In our experiments, computing the fRank for all five billion Web pages was approximately 100 times faster than computing the PageRank for the same set. 5.4 Results As Table 1 shows, fRank significantly outperforms PageRank for the purposes of static ranking.",
                "With a pairwise accuracy of 67.4%, fRank more than doubles the accuracy of PageRank (relative to the baseline of 50%, which is the accuracy that would be achieved by a random ordering of Web pages).",
                "Note that one of fRanks input features is the PageRank of the page, so we would expect it to perform no worse than PageRank.",
                "The significant increase in accuracy implies that the other features (anchor, popularity, etc.) do in fact contain useful information regarding the overall quality of a page.",
                "Table 1: Basic Results Technique Accuracy (%) None (Baseline) 50.00 PageRank 56.70 fRank 67.43 There are a number of decisions that go into the computation of PageRank, such as how to deal with pages that have no outlinks, the choice of α, numeric precision, convergence threshold, etc.",
                "We were able to obtain a computation of PageRank from a completely independent implementation (provided by Marc Najork) that varied somewhat in these parameters.",
                "It achieved a pairwise accuracy of 56.52%, nearly identical to that obtained by our implementation.",
                "We thus concluded that the quality of the PageRank is not sensitive to these minor variations in algorithm, nor was PageRanks low accuracy due to problems with our implementation of it.",
                "We also wanted to find how well each feature set performed.",
                "To answer this, for each feature set, we trained and tested fRank using only that set of features.",
                "The results are shown in Table 2.",
                "As can be seen, every single feature set individually outperformed PageRank on this test.",
                "Perhaps the most interesting result is that the Page-level features had the highest performance out of all the feature sets.",
                "This is surprising because these are features that do not depend on the overall graph structure of the Web, nor even on what pages point to a given page.",
                "This is contrary to the common belief that the Web graph structure is the key to finding a good static ranking of Web pages.",

                "This means that a particular feature that appears to have little value in isolation could actually be very important when used in combination with other features.",

                "One fix for this is to add information about the link to the PageRank computation, such as the size of the text, whether it was at the bottom of the page, etc.",
                "The other bias comes from the fact that the population of Web site authors is different than the population of Web users.",
                "Web authors tend to be technologically-oriented, and thus their linking behavior reflects those interests. fRank, by knowing the actual visitation popularity of a site (the popularity feature set), is able to eliminate some of that bias.",

                "The primary differences between this work and ours are the goal (discovering what constitutes a good Web page vs. ordering Web pages for the purposes of Web search), the size of the study (they used a dataset of less than 6000 pages vs. our set of 468,000), and our comparison with PageRank. y = 0.577Ln(x) + 58.283 R 2 = 0.9822 58 58.5 59 59.5 60 60.5 61 1 10 100 Days of Toolbar Data PairwiseAccuracy Figure 1: Relation between the amount of popularity data and the performance of the popularity feature set.",
                "Note the x-axis is a logarithmic scale. 713 Nevertheless, their work provides insights to additional useful static features that we could incorporate into fRank in the future.",
                "Recent work on incorporating novel features into dynamic ranking includes that by Joachims et al. [21], who investigate the use of implicit feedback from users, in the form of which <br>search engine</br> results are clicked on.",
                "Craswell et al. [11] present a method for determining the best transformation to apply to query independent features (such as those used in this paper) for the purposes of improving dynamic ranking.",
                "Other work, such as Boyan et al. [4] and Bartell et al. [2] apply machine learning for the purposes of improving the overall relevance of a <br>search engine</br> (i.e., the dynamic ranking).",
                "They do not apply their techniques to the problem of static ranking. 6.3 Future work There are many ways in which we would like to extend this work.",
                "First, fRank uses only a small number of features.",
                "We believe we could achieve even more significant results with more features.",
                "In particular the existence, or lack thereof, of certain words could prove very significant (for instance, under construction probably signifies a low quality page).",
                "Other features could include the number of images on a page, size of those images, number of layout elements (tables, divs, and spans), use of style sheets, conforming to W3C standards (like XHTML 1.0 Strict), background color of a page, etc.",
                "Many pages are generated dynamically, the contents of which may depend on parameters in the URL, the time of day, the user visiting the site, or other variables.",
                "For such pages, it may be useful to apply the techniques found in [26] to form a static approximation for the purposes of extracting features.",
                "The resulting grammar describing the page could itself be a source of additional features describing the complexity of the page, such as how many non-terminal nodes it has, the depth of the grammar tree, etc. fRank allows one to specify a confidence in each pairing of documents.",
                "In the future, we will experiment with probabilities that depend on the difference in human judgments between the two items in the pair.",
                "For example, a pair of documents where one was rated 4 and the other 0 should have a higher confidence than a pair of documents rated 3 and 2.",
                "The experiments in this paper are biased toward pages that have higher than average quality.",
                "Also, fRank with all of the features can only be applied to pages that have already been crawled.",
                "Thus, fRank is primarily useful for index ordering and improving relevance, not for directing the crawl.",
                "We would like to investigate a machine learning approach for crawl prioritization as well.",
                "It may be that a combination of methods is best: for example, using PageRank to select the best 5 billion of the 20 billion pages on the Web, then using fRank to order the index and affect search relevancy.",
                "Another interesting direction for exploration is to incorporate fRank and page-level features directly into the PageRank computation itself.",
                "Work on biasing the PageRank jump vector [16], and transition matrix [29], have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of such an approach.",
                "There is reason to believe that a direct application of [29], using the fRank of a page for its relevance, could lead to an improved overall static rank.",
                "Finally, the popularity data can be used in other interesting ways.",
                "The general surfing and searching habits of Web users varies by time of day.",
                "Activity in the morning, daytime, and evening are often quite different (e.g., reading the news, solving problems, and accessing entertainment, respectively).",
                "We can gain insight into these differences by using the popularity data, divided into segments of the day.",
                "When a query is issued, we would then use the popularity data matching the time of query in order to do the ranking of Web pages.",
                "We also plan to explore popularity features that use more than just the counts of how often a page was visited.",
                "For example, how long users tended to dwell on a page, did they leave the page by clicking a link or by hitting the back button, etc.",
                "Fox et al. did a study that showed that features such as this can be valuable for the purposes of dynamic ranking [14].",
                "Finally, the popularity data could be used as the label rather than as a feature.",
                "Using fRank in this way to predict the popularity of a page may useful for the tasks of relevance, efficiency, and crawl priority.",
                "There is also significantly more popularity data than human labeled data, potentially enabling more complex machine learning methods, and significantly more features. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS A good static ranking is an important component for todays search engines and information retrieval systems.",
                "We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank.",
                "By combining many static features, fRank achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise accuracy than PageRank alone.",
                "A qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that Web users, rather than Web authors, visit.",
                "The machine learning component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further developments in the machine learning community in areas such as adversarial classification.",
                "We have only begun to explore the options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the area of static ranking by further experimentation with additional features, other machine learning techniques, and additional sources of data. 8.",
