It solicits the users relevance judgments on the retrieved images returned by the CBIR systems. The users labeling is then used to learn a classifier to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant images. However, the top returned images may not be the most informative ones. The challenge is thus to determine which unlabeled images would be the most informative (i.e., improve the classifier the most) if they were labeled and used as training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm, called Laplacian Optimal Design (LOD), for relevance feedback image retrieval. Our algorithm is based on a regression model which minimizes the least square error on the measured (or, labeled) images and simultaneously preserves the local geometrical structure of the image space. Specifically, we assume that if two images are sufficiently close to each other, then their measurements (or, labels) are close as well. By constructing a nearest neighbor graph, the geometrical structure of the image space can be described by the graph Laplacian. We discuss how results from the field of optimal experimental design may be used to guide our selection of a subset of images, which gives us the most amount of information. Experimental results on Corel database suggest that the proposed approach achieves higher precision in relevance feedback image retrieval.

INTRODUCTION In many machine learning and information retrieval tasks, there is no shortage of unlabeled data but labels are expensive. The challenge is thus to determine which unlabeled samples would be the most informative (i.e., improve the classifier the most) if they were labeled and used as training samples. This problem is typically called active learning [4]. Here the task is to minimize an overall cost, which depends both on the classifier accuracy and the cost of data collection. Many real world applications can be casted into active learning framework. Particularly, we consider the problem of relevance feedback driven Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) [13]. Content-Based Image Retrieval has attracted substantial interests in the last decade [13]. It is motivated by the fast growth of digital image databases which, in turn, require efficient search schemes. Rather than describe an image using text, in these systems an image query is described using one or more example images. The low level visual features (color, texture, shape, etc.) are automatically extracted to represent the images. However, the low level features may not accurately characterize the high level semantic concepts. To narrow down the semantic gap, relevance feedback is introduced into CBIR [12]. In many of the current relevance feedback driven CBIR systems, the user is required to provide his/her relevance judgments on the top images returned by the system. The labeled images are then used to train a classifier to separate images that match the query concept from those that do not. However, in general the top returned images may not be the most informative ones. In the worst case, all the top images labeled by the user may be positive and thus the standard classification techniques can not be applied due to the lack of negative examples. Unlike the standard classification problems where the labeled samples are pregiven, in relevance feedback image retrieval the system can actively select the images to label. Thus active learning can be naturally introduced into image retrieval. Despite many existing active learning techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM) active learning [14] and regression based active learning [1] have received the most interests. Based on the observation that the closer to the SVM boundary an image is, the less reliable its classification is, SVM active learning selects those unlabeled images closest to the boundary to solicit user feedback so as to achieve maximal refinement on the hyperplane between the two classes. The major disadvantage of SVM active learning is that the estimated boundary may not be accurate enough. Moreover, it may not be applied at the beginning of the retrieval when there is no labeled images. Some other SVM based active learning algorithms can be found in [7], [9]. In statistics, the problem of selecting samples to label is typically referred to as experimental design. The sample x is referred to as experiment, and its label y is referred to as measurement. The study of optimal experimental design (OED) [1] is concerned with the design of experiments that are expected to minimize variances of a parameterized model. The intent of optimal experimental design is usually to maximize confidence in a given model, minimize parameter variances for system identification, or minimize the models output variance. Classical experimental design approaches include A-Optimal Design, D-Optimal Design, and E-Optimal Design. All of these approaches are based on a least squares regression model. Comparing to SVM based active learning algorithms, experimental design approaches are much more efficient in computation. However, this kind of approaches takes only measured (or, labeled) data into account in their objective function, while the unmeasured (or, unlabeled) data is ignored. Benefit from recent progresses on optimal experimental design and semi-supervised learning, in this paper we propose a novel active learning algorithm for image retrieval, called Laplacian Optimal Design (LOD). Unlike traditional experimental design methods whose loss functions are only defined on the measured points, the loss function of our proposed LOD algorithm is defined on both measured and unmeasured points. Specifically, we introduce a locality preserving regularizer into the standard least-square-error based loss function. The new loss function aims to find a classifier which is locally as smooth as possible. In other words, if two points are sufficiently close to each other in the input space, then they are expected to share the same label. Once the loss function is defined, we can select the most informative data points which are presented to the user for labeling. It would be important to note that the most informative images may not be the top returned images. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a brief description of the related work. Our proposed Laplacian Optimal Design algorithm is introduced in Section 3. In Section 4, we compare our algorithm with the state-or-the-art algorithms and present the experimental results on image retrieval. Finally, we provide some concluding remarks and suggestions for future work in Section 5. 2. RELATED WORK Since our proposed algorithm is based on regression framework. The most related work is optimal experimental design [1], including A-Optimal Design, D-Optimal Design, and EOptimal Design. In this Section, we give a brief description of these approaches. 2.1 The Active Learning Problem The generic problem of active learning is the following. Given a set of points A = {x1, x2, · · · , xm} in Rd , find a subset B = {z1, z2, · · · , zk} ⊂ A which contains the most informative points. In other words, the points zi(i = 1, · · · , k) can improve the classifier the most if they are labeled and used as training points. 2.2 Optimal Experimental Design We consider a linear regression model y = wT x + (1) where y is the observation, x is the independent variable, w is the weight vector and is an unknown error with zero mean. Different observations have errors that are independent, but with equal variances σ2 . We define f(x) = wT x to be the learners output given input x and the weight vector w. Suppose we have a set of labeled sample points (z1, y1), · · · , (zk, yk), where yi is the label of zi. Thus, the maximum likelihood estimate for the weight vector, ˆw, is that which minimizes the sum squared error Jsse(w) = k i=1 wT zi − yi 2 (2) The estimate ˆw gives us an estimate of the output at a novel input: ˆy = ˆwT x. By Gauss-Markov theorem, we know that ˆw − w has a zero mean and a covariance matrix given by σ2 H−1 sse, where Hsse is the Hessian of Jsse(w) Hsse = ∂2 Jsse ∂w2 = k i=1 zizT i = ZZT where Z = (z1, z2, · · · , zk). The three most common scalar measures of the size of the parameter covariance matrix in optimal experimental design are: • D-optimal design: determinant of Hsse. • A-optimal design: trace of Hsse. • E-optimal design: maximum eigenvalue of Hsse. Since the computation of the determinant and eigenvalues of a matrix is much more expensive than the computation of matrix trace, A-optimal design is more efficient than the other two. Some recent work on experimental design can be found in [6], [16]. 3. LAPLACIAN OPTIMAL DESIGN Since the covariance matrix Hsse used in traditional approaches is only dependent on the measured samples, i.e. zis, these approaches fail to evaluate the expected errors on the unmeasured samples. In this Section, we introduce a novel active learning algorithm called Laplacian Optimal Design (LOD) which makes efficient use of both measured (labeled) and unmeasured (unlabeled) samples. 3.1 The Objective Function In many machine learning problems, it is natural to assume that if two points xi, xj are sufficiently close to each other, then their measurements (f(xi), f(xj)) are close as well. Let S be a similarity matrix. Thus, a new loss function which respects the geometrical structure of the data space can be defined as follows: J0(w) = k i=1 f(zi)−yi 2 + λ 2 m i,j=1 f(xi)−f(xj) 2 Sij (3) where yi is the measurement (or, label) of zi. Note that, the loss function (3) is essentially the same as the one used in Laplacian Regularized Regression (LRR, [2]). However, LRR is a passive learning algorithm where the training data is given. In this paper, we are focused on how to select the most informative data for training. The loss function with our choice of symmetric weights Sij (Sij = Sji) incurs a heavy penalty if neighboring points xi and xj are mapped far apart. Therefore, minimizing J0(w) is an attempt to ensure that if xi and xj are close then f(xi) and f(xj) are close as well. There are many choices of the similarity matrix S. A simple definition is as follows: Sij = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 1, if xi is among the p nearest neighbors of xj, or xj is among the p nearest neighbors of xi; 0, otherwise. (4) Let D be a diagonal matrix, Dii = j Sij, and L = D−S. The matrix L is called graph Laplacian in spectral graph theory [3]. Let y = (y1, · · · , yk)T and X = (x1, · · · , xm). Following some simple algebraic steps, we see that: J0(w) = k i=1 wT zi − yi 2 + λ 2 m i,j=1 wT xi − wT xj 2 Sij = y − ZT w T y − ZT w + λwT m i=1 DiixixT i − m i,j=1 SijxixT j w = yT y − 2wT Zy + wT ZZT w +λwT XDXT − XSXT w = yT y − 2wT Zy + wT ZZT + λXLXT w The Hessian of J0(w) can be computed as follows: H0 = ∂2 J0 ∂w2 = ZZT + λXLXT In some cases, the matrix ZZT +λXLXT is singular (e.g. if m < d). Thus, there is no stable solution to the optimization problem Eq. (3). A common way to deal with this ill-posed problem is to introduce a Tikhonov regularizer into our loss function: J(w) = k i=1 wT zi − yi 2 + λ1 2 m i,j=1 wT xi − wT xj 2 Sij +λ2 w 2 (5) The Hessian of the new loss function is given by: H = ∂2 J ∂w2 = ZZT + λ1XLXT + λ2I := ZZT + Λ where I is an identity matrix and Λ = λ1XLXT + λ2I. Clearly, H is of full rank. Requiring that the gradient of J(w) with respect to w vanish gives the optimal estimate ˆw: ˆw = H−1 Zy The following proposition states the bias and variance properties of the estimator for the coefficient vector w. Proposition 3.1. E( ˆw − w) = −H−1 Λw, Cov( ˆw) = σ2 (H−1 − H−1 ΛH−1 ) Proof. Since y = ZT w + and E( ) = 0, it follows that E( ˆw − w) (6) = H−1 ZZT w − w = H−1 (ZZT + Λ − Λ)w − w = (I − H−1 Λ)w − w = −H−1 Λw (7) Notice Cov(y) = σ2 I, the covariance matrix of ˆw has the expression: Cov( ˆw) = H−1 ZCov(y)ZT H−1 = σ2 H−1 ZZT H−1 = σ2 H−1 (H − Λ)H−1 = σ2 (H−1 − H−1 ΛH−1 ) (8) Therefore mean squared error matrix for the coefficients w is E(w − ˆw)(w − ˆw)T (9) = H−1 ΛwwT ΛH−1 + σ2 (H−1 − H−1 ΛH−1 ) (10) For any x, let ˆy = ˆwT x be its predicted observation. The expected squared prediction error is E(y − ˆy)2 = E( + wT x − ˆwT x)2 = σ2 + xT [E(w − ˆw)(w − ˆw)T ]x = σ2 + xT [H−1 ΛwwT ΛH−1 + σ2 H−1 − σ2 H−1 ΛH−1 ]x Clearly the expected square prediction error depends on the explanatory variable x, therefore average expected square predictive error over the complete data set A is 1 m m i=1 E(yi − ˆwT xi)2 = 1 m m i=1 xT i [H−1 ΛwwT ΛH−1 + σ2 H−1 − σ2 H−1 ΛH−1 ]xi +σ2 = 1 m Tr(XT [σ2 H−1 + H−1 ΛwwT ΛH−1 − σ2 H−1 ΛH−1 ]X) +σ2 Since Tr(XT [H−1 ΛwwT ΛH−1 − σ2 H−1 ΛH−1 ]X) Tr(σ2 XT H−1 X), Our Laplacian optimality criterion is thus formulated by minimizing the trace of XT H−1 X. Definition 1. Laplacian Optimal Design min Z=(z1,··· ,zk) Tr XT ZZT + λ1XLXT + λ2I −1 X (11) where z1, · · · , zk are selected from {x1, · · · , xm}. 4. KERNEL LAPLACIAN OPTIMAL DESIGN Canonical experimental design approaches (e.g. A-Optimal Design, D-Optimal Design, and E-Optimal) only consider linear functions. They fail to discover the intrinsic geometry in the data when the data space is highly nonlinear. In this section, we describe how to perform Laplacian Experimental Design in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) which gives rise to Kernel Laplacian Experimental Design (KLOD). For given data points x1, · · · , xm ∈ X with a positive definite mercer kernel K : X ×X → R, there exists a unique RKHS HK of real valued functions on X. Let Kt(s) be the function of s obtained by fixing t and letting Kt(s) . = K(s, t). HK consists of all finite linear combinations of the form l i=1 αiKti with ti ∈ X and limits of such functions as the ti become dense in X. We have Ks, Kt HK = K(s, t). 4.1 Derivation of LOD in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space Consider the optimization problem (5) in RKHS. Thus, we seek a function f ∈ HK such that the following objective function is minimized: min f∈HK k i=1 f(zi)−yi 2 + λ1 2 m i,j=1 f(xi)−f(xj) 2 Sij+λ2 f 2 HK (12) We have the following proposition. Proposition 4.1. Let H = { m i=1 αiK(·, xi)|αi ∈ R} be a subspace of HK , the solution to the problem (12) is in H. Proof. Let H⊥ be the orthogonal complement of H, i.e. HK = H ⊕ H⊥ . Thus, for any function f ∈ HK , it has orthogonal decomposition as follows: f = fH + fH⊥ Now, lets evaluate f at xi: f(xi) = f, Kxi HK = fH + fH⊥ , Kxi HK = fH, Kxi HK + fH⊥ , Kxi HK Notice that Kxi ∈ H while fH⊥ ∈ H⊥ . This implies that fH⊥ , Kxi HK = 0. Therefore, f(xi) = fH, Kxi HK = fH(xi) This completes the proof. Proposition 4.1 tells us the minimizer of problem (12) admits a representation f∗ = m i=1 αiK(·, xi). Please see [2] for the details. Let φ : Rd → H be a feature map from the input space Rd to H, and K(xi, xj) =< φ(xi), φ(xj) >. Let X denote the data matrix in RKHS, X = (φ(x1), φ(x2), · · · , φ(xm)). Similarly, we define Z = (φ(z1), φ(z2), · · · , φ(zk)). Thus, the optimization problem in RKHS can be written as follows: min Z Tr XT ZZT + λ1XLXT + λ2I −1 X (13) Since the mapping function φ is generally unknown, there is no direct way to solve problem (13). In the following, we apply kernel tricks to solve this optimization problem. Let X−1 be the Moore-Penrose inverse (also known as pseudo inverse) of X. Thus, we have: XT ZZT + λ1XLXT + λ2I −1 X = XT XX−1 ZZT + λ1XLXT + λ2I −1 (XT )−1 XT X = XT X ZZT X + λ1XLXT X + λ2X −1 (XT )−1 XT X = XT X XT ZZT X + λ1XT XLXT X + λ2XT X −1 XT X = KXX KXZKZX + λ1KXXLKXX + λ2KXX −1 KXX where KXX is a m × m matrix (KXX,ij = K(xi, xj)), KXZ is a m×k matrix (KXZ,ij = K(xi, zj)), and KZX is a k×m matrix (KZX,ij = K(zi, xj)). Thus, the Kernel Laplacian Optimal Design can be defined as follows: Definition 2. Kernel Laplacian Optimal Design minZ=(z1,··· ,zk) Tr KXX KXZKZX + λ1KXXLKXX λ2KXX −1 KXX (14) 4.2 Optimization Scheme In this subsection, we discuss how to solve the optimization problems (11) and (14). Particularly, if we select a linear kernel for KLOD, then it reduces to LOD. Therefore, we will focus on problem (14) in the following. It can be shown that the optimization problem (14) is NP-hard. In this subsection, we develop a simple sequential greedy approach to solve (14). Suppose n points have been selected, denoted by a matrix Zn = (z1, · · · , zn). The (n + 1)-th point zn+1 can be selected by solving the following optimization problem: max Zn+1=(Zn,zn+1) Tr KXX KXZn+1 KZn+1X + λ1KXXLKXX + λ2KXX −1 KXX (15) The kernel matrices KXZn+1 and KZn+1X can be rewritten as follows: KXZn+1 = KXZn , KXzn+1 , KZn+1X = KZnX Kzn+1X Thus, we have: KXZn+1 KZn+1X = KXZn KZnX + KXzn+1 Kzn+1X We define: A = KXZn KZnX + λ1KXXLKXX + λ2KXX A is only dependent on X and Zn . Thus, the (n + 1)-th point zn+1 is given by: zn+1 = arg min zn+1 Tr KXX A + KXzn+1 Kzn+1X −1 KXX (16) Each time we select a new point zn+1, the matrix A is updated by: A ← A + KXzn+1 Kzn+1X If the kernel function is chosen as inner product K(x, y) = x, y , then HK is a linear functional space and the algorithm reduces to LOD. 5. CONTENT-BASED IMAGE RETRIEVAL USING LAPLACIAN OPTIMAL DESIGN In this section, we describe how to apply Laplacian Optimal Design to CBIR. We begin with a brief description of image representation using low level visual features. 5.1 Low-Level Image Representation Low-level image representation is a crucial problem in CBIR. General visual features includes color, texture, shape, etc. Color and texture features are the most extensively used visual features in CBIR. Compared with color and texture features, shape features are usually described after images have been segmented into regions or objects. Since robust and accurate image segmentation is difficult to achieve, the use of shape features for image retrieval has been limited to special applications where objects or regions are readily available. In this work, We combine 64-dimensional color histogram and 64-dimensional Color Texture Moment (CTM, [15]) to represent the images. The color histogram is calculated using 4 × 4 × 4 bins in HSV space. The Color Texture Moment is proposed by Yu et al. [15], which integrates the color and texture characteristics of the image in a compact form. CTM adopts local Fourier transform as a texture representation scheme and derives eight characteristic maps to describe different aspects of co-occurrence relations of image pixels in each channel of the (SVcosH, SVsinH, V) color space. Then CTM calculates the first and second moment of these maps as a representation of the natural color image pixel distribution. Please see [15] for details. 5.2 Relevance Feedback Image Retrieval Relevance feedback is one of the most important techniques to narrow down the gap between low level visual features and high level semantic concepts [12]. Traditionally, the users relevance feedbacks are used to update the query vector or adjust the weighting of different dimensions. This process can be viewed as an on-line learning process in which the image retrieval system acts as a learner and the user acts as a teacher. They typical retrieval process is outlined as follows: 1. The user submits a query image example to the system. The system ranks the images in database according to some pre-defined distance metric and presents to the user the top ranked images. 2. The system selects some images from the database and request the user to label them as relevant or irrelevant. 3. The system uses the users provided information to rerank the images in database and returns to the user the top images. Go to step 2 until the user is satisfied. Our Laplacian Optimal Design algorithm is applied in the second step for selecting the most informative images. Once we get the labels for the images selected by LOD, we apply Laplacian Regularized Regression (LRR, [2]) to solve the optimization problem (3) and build the classifier. The classifier is then used to re-rank the images in database. Note that, in order to reduce the computational complexity, we do not use all the unlabeled images in the database but only those within top 500 returns of previous iteration. 6. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS In this section, we evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm on a large image database. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed LOD algorithm, we compare it with Laplacian Regularized Regression (LRR, [2]), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Support Vector Machine Active Learning (SVMactive) [14], and A-Optimal Design (AOD). Both SVMactive, AOD, and LOD are active learning algorithms, while LRR and SVM are standard classification algorithms. SVM only makes use of the labeled images, while LRR is a semi-supervised learning algorithm which makes use of both labeled and unlabeled images. For SVMactive, AOD, and LOD, 10 training images are selected by the algorithms themselves at each iteration. While for LRR and SVM, we use the top 10 images as training data. It would be important to note that SVMactive is based on the ordinary SVM, LOD is based on LRR, and AOD is based on the ordinary regression. The parameters λ1 and λ2 in our LOD algorithm are empirically set to be 0.001 and 0.00001. For both LRR and LOD algorithms, we use the same graph structure (see Eq. 4) and set the value of p (number of nearest neighbors) to be 5. We begin with a simple synthetic example to give some intuition about how LOD works. 6.1 Simple Synthetic Example A simple synthetic example is given in Figure 1. The data set contains two circles. Eight points are selected by AOD and LOD. As can be seen, all the points selected by AOD are from the big circle, while LOD selects four points from the big circle and four from the small circle. The numbers beside the selected points denote their orders to be selected. Clearly, the points selected by our LOD algorithm can better represent the original data set. We did not compare our algorithm with SVMactive because SVMactive can not be applied in this case due to the lack of the labeled points. 6.2 Image Retrieval Experimental Design The image database we used consists of 7,900 images of 79 semantic categories, from COREL data set. It is a large and heterogeneous image set. Each image is represented as a 128-dimensional vector as described in Section 5.1. Figure 2 shows some sample images. To exhibit the advantages of using our algorithm, we need a reliable way of evaluating the retrieval performance and the comparisons with other algorithms. We list different aspects of the experimental design below. 6.2.1 Evaluation Metrics We use precision-scope curve and precision rate [10] to evaluate the effectiveness of the image retrieval algorithms. The scope is specified by the number (N) of top-ranked images presented to the user. The precision is the ratio of the number of relevant images presented to the user to the (a) Data set 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (b) AOD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (c) LOD Figure 1: Data selection by active learning algorithms. The numbers beside the selected points denote their orders to be selected. Clearly, the points selected by our LOD algorithm can better represent the original data set. Note that, the SVMactive algorithm can not be applied in this case due to the lack of labeled points. (a) (b) (c) Figure 2: Sample images from category bead, elephant, and ship. scope N. The precision-scope curve describes the precision with various scopes and thus gives an overall performance evaluation of the algorithms. On the other hand, the precision rate emphasizes the precision at a particular value of scope. In general, it is appropriate to present 20 images on a screen. Putting more images on a screen may affect the quality of the presented images. Therefore, the precision at top 20 (N = 20) is especially important. In real world image retrieval systems, the query image is usually not in the image database. To simulate such environment, we use five-fold cross validation to evaluate the algorithms. More precisely, we divide the whole image database into five subsets with equal size. Thus, there are 20 images per category in each subset. At each run of cross validation, one subset is selected as the query set, and the other four subsets are used as the database for retrieval. The precisionscope curve and precision rate are computed by averaging the results from the five-fold cross validation. 6.2.2 Automatic Relevance Feedback Scheme We designed an automatic feedback scheme to model the retrieval process. For each submitted query, our system retrieves and ranks the images in the database. 10 images were selected from the database for user labeling and the label information is used by the system for re-ranking. Note that, the images which have been selected at previous iterations are excluded from later selections. For each query, the automatic relevance feedback mechanism is performed for four iterations. It is important to note that the automatic relevance feedback scheme used here is different from the ones described in [8], [11]. In [8], [11], the top four relevant and irrelevant images were selected as the feedback images. However, this may not be practical. In real world image retrieval systems, it is possible that most of the top-ranked images are relevant (or, irrelevant). Thus, it is difficult for the user to find both four relevant and irrelevant images. It is more reasonable for the users to provide feedback information only on the 10 images selected by the system. 6.3 Image Retrieval Performance In real world, it is not practical to require the user to provide many rounds of feedbacks. The retrieval performance after the first two rounds of feedbacks (especially the first round) is more important. Figure 3 shows the average precision-scope curves of the different algorithms for the first two feedback iterations. At the beginning of retrieval, the Euclidean distances in the original 128-dimensional space are used to rank the images in database. After the user provides relevance feedbacks, the LRR, SVM, SVMactive, AOD, and LOD algorithms are then applied to re-rank the images. In order to reduce the time complexity of active learning algorithms, we didnt select the most informative images from the whole database but from the top 500 images. For LRR and SVM, the user is required to label the top 10 images. For SVMactive, AOD, and LOD, the user is required to label 10 most informative images selected by these algorithms. Note that, SVMactive can only be ap(a) Feedback Iteration 1 (b) Feedback Iteration 2 Figure 3: The average precision-scope curves of different algorithms for the first two feedback iterations. The LOD algorithm performs the best on the entire scope. Note that, at the first round of feedback, the SVMactive algorithm can not be applied. It applies the ordinary SVM to build the initial classifier.

As can be seen, our LOD algorithm consistently outperforms the other four algorithms. plied when the classifier is already built. Therefore, it can not be applied at the first round and we use the standard SVM to build the initial classifier. As can be seen, our LOD algorithm outperforms the other four algorithms on the entire scope. Also, the LRR algorithm performs better than SVM. This is because that the LRR algorithm makes efficient use of the unlabeled images by incorporating a locality preserving regularizer into the ordinary regression objective function. The AOD algorithm performs the worst. As the scope gets larger, the performance difference between these algorithms gets smaller. By iteratively adding the users feedbacks, the corresponding precision results (at top 10, top 20, and top 30) of the five algorithms are respectively shown in Figure 4. As can be seen, our LOD algorithm performs the best in all the cases and the LRR algorithm performs the second best. Both of these two algorithms make use of the unlabeled images. This shows that the unlabeled images are helpful for discovering the intrinsic geometrical structure of the image space and therefore enhance the retrieval performance. In real world, the user may not be willing to provide too many relevance feedbacks. Therefore, the retrieval performance at the first two rounds are especially important. As can be seen, our LOD algorithm achieves 6.8% performance improvement for top 10 results, 5.2% for top 20 results, and 4.1% for top 30 results, comparing to the second best algorithm (LRR) after the first two rounds of relevance feedbacks. 6.4 Discussion Several experiments on Corel database have been systematically performed. We would like to highlight several interesting points: 1. It is clear that the use of active learning is beneficial in the image retrieval domain. There is a significant increase in performance from using the active learning methods. Especially, out of the three active learning methods (SVMactive, AOD, LOD), our proposed LOD algorithm performs the best. 2. In many real world applications like relevance feedback image retrieval, there are generally two ways of reducing labor-intensive manual labeling task. One is active learning which selects the most informative samples to label, and the other is semi-supervised learning which makes use of the unlabeled samples to enhance the learning performance. Both of these two strategies have been studied extensively in the past [14], [7], [5], [8]. The work presented in this paper is focused on active learning, but it also takes advantage of the recent progresses on semi-supervised learning [2]. Specifically, we incorporate a locality preserving regularizer into the standard regression framework and find the most informative samples with respect to the new objective function. In this way, the active learning and semi-supervised learning techniques are seamlessly unified for learning an optimal classifier. 3. The relevance feedback technique is crucial to image retrieval. For all the five algorithms, the retrieval performance improves with more feedbacks provided by the user. 7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper describes a novel active learning algorithm, called Laplacian Optimal Design, to enable more effective relevance feedback image retrieval. Our algorithm is based on an objective function which simultaneously minimizes the empirical error and preserves the local geometrical structure of the data space. Using techniques from experimental design, our algorithm finds the most informative images to label. These labeled images and the unlabeled images in the database are used to learn a classifier. The experimental results on Corel database show that both active learning and semi-supervised learning can significantly improve the retrieval performance. In this paper, we consider the image retrieval problem on a small, static, and closed-domain image data. A much more challenging domain is the World Wide Web (WWW). For Web image search, it is possible to collect a large amount of user click information. This information can be naturally used to construct the affinity graph in our algorithm. However, the computational complexity in Web scenario may become a crucial issue. Also, although our primary interest in this paper is focused on relevance feedback image retrieval, our results may also be of interest to researchers in patten recognition and machine learning, especially when a large amount of data is available but only a limited samples can be labeled. 8.

Burbank, CA 91504 hex@yahoo-inc.com Wanli Min Ibm Yorktown Heights, NY 10598 wanlimin@us.ibm.com Deng Cai CS Departamento, UIUC Urbana, IL 61801 Dengcai2@cs.uiuc.edu Kun Zhou Microsoft Research Asia Beijing, China kunzhou@microsoft.com Resumen La retroalimentación de relevancia es una técnica poderosa para mejorar el rendimiento de recuperación de imágenes basada en el contenido (CBIR). Solicita a los usuarios juicios de relevancia sobre las imágenes recuperadas devueltas por los sistemas CBIR. El etiquetado de los usuarios se usa para aprender un clasificador para distinguir entre imágenes relevantes e irrelevantes. Sin embargo, las imágenes devueltas superiores pueden no ser las más informativas. Por lo tanto, el desafío es determinar qué imágenes no etiquetadas serían la más informativa (es decir, mejorar el clasificador) si se etiquetaron y se usan como muestras de entrenamiento. En este documento, proponemos un nuevo algoritmo de aprendizaje activo, llamado Laplacian Optimal Design (LOD), para la recuperación de la imagen de retroalimentación relevante. Nuestro algoritmo se basa en un modelo de regresión que minimiza el error de mínimo cuadrado en las imágenes medidas (o etiquetadas) y preserva simultáneamente la estructura geométrica local del espacio de la imagen. Específicamente, suponemos que si dos imágenes están suficientemente cercanas entre sí, entonces sus medidas (o etiquetas) también están cerca. Al construir un gráfico vecino más cercano, la estructura geométrica del espacio de la imagen puede describirse con el gráfico Laplacian. Discutimos cómo se pueden utilizar los resultados del campo del diseño experimental óptimo para guiar nuestra selección de un subconjunto de imágenes, lo que nos brinda la mayor cantidad de información. Los resultados experimentales en la base de datos COREL sugieren que el enfoque propuesto logra una mayor precisión en la recuperación de la imagen de retroalimentación relevante.

Introducción En muchas tareas de aprendizaje automático y recuperación de información, no hay escasez de datos no etiquetados, pero las etiquetas son caras. Por lo tanto, el desafío es determinar qué muestras no etiquetadas serían las más informativas (es decir, mejorar el clasificador más) si se etiquetaron y se usan como muestras de entrenamiento. Este problema generalmente se llama aprendizaje activo [4]. Aquí la tarea es minimizar un costo total, que depende tanto de la precisión del clasificador como del costo de la recopilación de datos. Muchas aplicaciones del mundo real se pueden iniciar en el marco de aprendizaje activo. Particularmente, consideramos el problema de relevancia de la recuperación de imágenes basada en contenido basada en retroalimentación (CBIR) [13]. La recuperación de imágenes basada en el contenido ha atraído intereses sustanciales en la última década [13]. Está motivado por el rápido crecimiento de las bases de datos de imágenes digitales que, a su vez, requieren esquemas de búsqueda eficientes. En lugar de describir una imagen usando texto, en estos sistemas se describe una consulta de imagen utilizando una o más imágenes de ejemplo. Las características visuales de bajo nivel (color, textura, forma, etc.) se extraen automáticamente para representar las imágenes. Sin embargo, las características de bajo nivel pueden no caracterizar con precisión los conceptos semánticos de alto nivel. Para reducir la brecha semántica, la retroalimentación de relevancia se introduce en CBIR [12]. En muchos de los sistemas CBIR impulsados por la retroalimentación de relevancia actual, se requiere que el usuario proporcione sus juicios de relevancia sobre las imágenes superiores devueltas por el sistema. Las imágenes etiquetadas se usan para entrenar un clasificador para separar las imágenes que coinciden con el concepto de consulta de las que no lo hacen. Sin embargo, en general, las imágenes devueltas superiores pueden no ser las más informativas. En el peor de los casos, todas las imágenes superiores etiquetadas por el usuario pueden ser positivas y, por lo tanto, las técnicas de clasificación estándar no se pueden aplicar debido a la falta de ejemplos negativos. A diferencia de los problemas de clasificación estándar donde las muestras etiquetadas están previas, en la recuperación de la imagen de retroalimentación relevante, el sistema puede seleccionar activamente las imágenes para etiquetar. Por lo tanto, el aprendizaje activo puede introducirse naturalmente en la recuperación de imágenes. A pesar de muchas técnicas de aprendizaje activo existentes, el aprendizaje activo de la máquina de vectores de soporte (SVM) y el aprendizaje activo basado en la regresión [1] han recibido la mayoría de los intereses. Según la observación de que cuanto más cerca del límite SVM es una imagen, cuanto menos confiable es su clasificación, SVM Active Learning selecciona aquellas imágenes sin etiqueta más cercanas al límite para solicitar la retroalimentación de los usuarios para lograr un refinamiento máximo en el hiperplano entre las dos clases. La principal desventaja del aprendizaje activo SVM es que el límite estimado puede no ser lo suficientemente preciso. Además, puede no aplicarse al comienzo de la recuperación cuando no hay imágenes etiquetadas. Algunos otros algoritmos de aprendizaje activo basados en SVM se pueden encontrar en [7], [9]. En estadísticas, el problema de seleccionar muestras a etiqueta generalmente se conoce como diseño experimental. La muestra X se conoce como experimento, y su etiqueta Y se conoce como medición. El estudio del diseño experimental óptimo (OED) [1] se refiere al diseño de experimentos que se espera que minimicen las variaciones de un modelo parametrizado. La intención de un diseño experimental óptimo generalmente es maximizar la confianza en un modelo dado, minimizar las variaciones de parámetros para la identificación del sistema o minimizar la varianza de salida de los modelos. Los enfoques clásicos de diseño experimental incluyen diseño óptimo A, diseño óptimo D y diseño óptimo E-óptimo. Todos estos enfoques se basan en un modelo de regresión de mínimos cuadrados. En comparación con los algoritmos de aprendizaje activo basados en SVM, los enfoques de diseño experimental son mucho más eficientes en el cálculo. Sin embargo, este tipo de enfoques solo tiene en cuenta los datos medidos (o, etiquetados) en su función objetivo, mientras que los datos no medidos (o sin etiquetar) se ignoran. Beneficio de los progresos recientes en un diseño experimental óptimo y un aprendizaje semi-supervisado, en este artículo proponemos un nuevo algoritmo de aprendizaje activo para la recuperación de imágenes, llamado Laplacian Optimal Design (LOD). A diferencia de los métodos de diseño experimentales tradicionales cuyas funciones de pérdida solo se definen en los puntos medidos, la función de pérdida de nuestro algoritmo LOD propuesto se define en los puntos medidos y no medidos. Específicamente, presentamos un regularizador de preservación de la localidad en la función de pérdida basada en el error de mínimo cuadrado estándar. La nueva función de pérdida tiene como objetivo encontrar un clasificador que sea localmente lo más suave posible. En otras palabras, si dos puntos están suficientemente cerca uno del otro en el espacio de entrada, entonces se espera que compartan la misma etiqueta. Una vez que se define la función de pérdida, podemos seleccionar los puntos de datos más informativos que se presentan al usuario para el etiquetado. Sería importante tener en cuenta que las imágenes más informativas pueden no ser las imágenes devueltas. El resto del documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, proporcionamos una breve descripción del trabajo relacionado. Nuestro algoritmo de diseño óptimo de Laplacian propuesto se introduce en la Sección 3. En la Sección 4, comparamos nuestro algoritmo con los algoritmos estatales o del arte y presentamos los resultados experimentales en la recuperación de imágenes. Finalmente, proporcionamos algunos comentarios y sugerencias finales para el trabajo futuro en la Sección 5. 2. Trabajo relacionado ya que nuestro algoritmo propuesto se basa en el marco de regresión. El trabajo más relacionado es el diseño experimental óptimo [1], incluido el diseño óptimo A, el diseño óptimo D y el diseño óptimo. En esta sección, damos una breve descripción de estos enfoques.2.1 El problema de aprendizaje activo El problema genérico del aprendizaje activo es el siguiente. Dado un conjunto de puntos a = {x1, x2, · · ·, xm} en rd, encuentre un subconjunto b = {z1, z2, · · ·, zk} ⊂ A que contiene los puntos más informativos. En otras palabras, los puntos Zi (i = 1, · · ·, k) pueden mejorar el clasificador más si están etiquetados y utilizados como puntos de entrenamiento.2.2 Diseño experimental óptimo Consideramos un modelo de regresión lineal Y = WT x + (1) donde y es la observación, x es la variable independiente, W es el vector de peso y es un error desconocido con media cero. Diferentes observaciones tienen errores que son independientes, pero con variaciones ácidas σ2. Definimos f (x) = wt x como la salida de los alumnos dada la entrada x y el vector de peso w.Supongamos que tenemos un conjunto de puntos de muestra etiquetados (Z1, Y1), · · ·, (Zk, YK), donde Yi es la etiqueta de Zi. Por lo tanto, la estimación de máxima probabilidad para el vector de peso, ˆW, es lo que minimiza el error cuadrado de suma JSSE (W) = K I = 1 WT Zi - Yi 2 (2) La estimación ˆW nos da una estimación de la salida en una novelaEntrada: ˆy = ˆwt x. Por el teorema de Gauss-Markov, sabemos que ˆW-W tiene una media cero y una matriz de covarianza dada por σ2 H-1 SSE, donde HSSE es el Hessian de JSSE (W) HSSE = ∂2 JSSE ∂W2 = K I = 1 Zizti = zzt donde z = (z1, z2, · · ·, zk). Las tres medidas escalar más comunes del tamaño de la matriz de covarianza de parámetros en un diseño experimental óptimo son: • Diseño óptimo D: determinante de HSSE.• Diseño óptimo A: traza de HSSE.• Diseño óptimo e óptimo: valor propio máximo de HSSE. Dado que el cálculo de los valores propios y propios de una matriz es mucho más costoso que el cálculo de la traza de matriz, el diseño óptimo A es más eficiente que los otros dos. Algunos trabajos recientes sobre diseño experimental se pueden encontrar en [6], [16].3. El diseño óptimo de Laplacian Dado que la matriz de covarianza HSSE utilizada en los enfoques tradicionales solo depende de las muestras medidas, es decir, ZIS, estos enfoques no pueden evaluar los errores esperados en las muestras no medidas. En esta sección, presentamos un nuevo algoritmo de aprendizaje activo llamado Laplacian Optimal Design (LOD) que hace un uso eficiente de muestras medidas (etiquetadas) y no medidas (sin etiquetar).3.1 La función objetivo En muchos problemas de aprendizaje automático, es natural suponer que si dos puntos Xi, XJ están suficientemente cerca el uno del otro, entonces sus mediciones (F (XI), F (XJ)) también están cerca. Sea s una matriz de similitud. Por lo tanto, una nueva función de pérdida que respeta la estructura geométrica del espacio de datos se puede definir de la siguiente manera: j0 (w) = k i = 1 f (zi) −yi 2 + λ 2 m i, j = 1 f (xi) −f(xj) 2 Sij (3) donde yi es la medición (o, etiqueta) de Zi. Tenga en cuenta que la función de pérdida (3) es esencialmente la misma que la que se usa en la regresión regularizada de Laplacian (LRR, [2]). Sin embargo, LRR es un algoritmo de aprendizaje pasivo donde se dan los datos de capacitación. En este artículo, estamos enfocados en cómo seleccionar los datos más informativos para la capacitación. La función de pérdida con nuestra elección de pesos simétricos SiJ (Sij = SJI) incurre en una gran penalización si los puntos vecinos XI y XJ están muy separados. Por lo tanto, minimizar J0 (W) es un intento de garantizar que si Xi y XJ estén cerca, F (Xi) y F (XJ) también estén cerca. Hay muchas opciones de la matriz de similitud S. Una definición simple es la siguiente: Sij = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 1, si Xi se encuentra entre los vecinos P más cercanos de XJ, o XJ se encuentra entre los vecinos P más cercanos de Xi;0, de lo contrario.(4) Sea D una matriz diagonal, DII = J Sij y L = D - S. La matriz L se llama gráfica laplacian en la teoría del gráfico espectral [3]. Sea y = (y1, · · ·, yk) t y x = (x1, · · ·, xm). Siguiendo algunos pasos algebraicos simples, vemos que: j0 (w) = k i = 1 wt zi - yi 2 + λ 2 m i, j = 1 wt xi - wt xj 2 sij = y - zt w t y - zt w + λwtm i = 1 Diixixting i - m i, j = 1 sijxixt J w = yt y - 2wt zy + wt zzt w + λwt xdxt - xsxt w = yt y - 2wt zy + wt zzt + λxlxt w la hessia de j0 (w) puede ser puede serCalculado de la siguiente manera: H0 = ∂2 J0 ∂w2 = ZZT + λxlxt En algunos casos, la matriz ZZT + λxlxt es singular (por ejemplo, si m <d). Por lo tanto, no existe una solución estable para el problema de optimización Eq.(3). Una forma común de lidiar con este problema mal plenado es introducir un regularizador de tikhonov en nuestra función de pérdida: j (w) = k i = 1 wt zi-yi 2 + λ1 2 m i, j = 1 wt xi-wt xj 2 Sij+ λ2 W 2 (5) La Hessia de la nueva función de pérdida viene dada por: H = ∂2 J ∂w2 = ZZT + λ1xlxt + λ2i: = Zzt + λ donde i es una matriz de identidad y λ = λ1xlxt + λ2i. Claramente, H es de rango completo. Requerir que el gradiente de J (W) con respecto a W desaparezca, proporciona la estimación óptima ˆW: ˆW = H - 1 ZY La siguiente proposición establece el sesgo y las propiedades de varianza del estimador para el vector coeficiente w.Proposición 3.1. E (ˆW - W) = −H - 1 λW, CoV (ˆW) = σ2 (H - 1 - H - 1 λH - 1). Dado que y = zt w + y e () = 0, se deduce que e (ˆw - w) (6) = h - 1 zzt w - w = h - 1 (zzt + λ - λ) w - w = (i- h - 1 λ) w - w = −h - 1 λw (7) aviso cov (y) = σ2 i, la matriz de covarianza de ˆw tiene la expresión: cov (ˆw) = h - 1 zCov (y) zt h h−1 = σ2 H - 1 ZZT H - 1 = σ2 H - 1 (H - λ) H - 1 = σ2 (H - 1 - H - 1 λH - 1) (8) Por lo tanto, la matriz de error cuadrático medio para los coeficientes Wes e (w - ˆw) (w - ˆw) t (9) = h - 1 λwwt λh - 1 + σ2 (h - 1 - h - 1 λh - 1) (10) para cualquier x, let ˆy = ˆwt xser su observación predicha. El error de predicción al cuadrado esperado es E (y - ˆy) 2 = E ( + wt x - ˆwt x) 2 = σ2 + xt [e (w - ˆw) (w - ˆw) t] x = σ2 + xt [h−1 λwwt λh - 1 + σ2 h - 1 - σ2 h - 1 λh - 1] claramente el error de predicción cuadrada esperada depende de la variable explicativa x, por lo tanto, el error predictivo cuadrado promedio esperado sobre el conjunto de datos completo A es 1 m m i = 1E (yi - ˆwt xi) 2 = 1 m m i = 1 xt i [h - 1 λwwt λH - 1 + σ2 h - 1 - σ2 h - 1 λH - 1] xi + σ2 = 1 M TR (xt [σ2 h−1 + h - 1 λwwt λH -1 - 1 σ2 h -1 λH - 1] x) + σ2 ya desde TR (TR (XT [H - 1 λWWT λHT λH -1 - 1 - 1 σ2 h - 1 λH - 1] x) TR (σ2 tern HOWS HEDS HEDS HEDS HEDS HEDO ALDO ALLO ALLO ALDO ALLO ALLOododos−1 x), nuestro criterio de optimización laplaciana se formula así minimizando el rastro de XT H - 1 X. Definición 1. Diseño óptimo de Laplacian Min Z = (Z1, ···, Zk) TR XT ZZT + λ1XLXT + λ2I −1 x (11) donde Z1, · · ·, Zk se seleccionan de {x1, · · ·, xm}.4. Enfoques de diseño experimental canónico de diseño luplacio del núcleo (p. Ej. Diseño óptimo A, diseño D-óptimo y E-óptimo) solo consideran funciones lineales. No pueden descubrir la geometría intrínseca en los datos cuando el espacio de datos es altamente no lineal. En esta sección, describimos cómo realizar el diseño experimental de la laplacia en la reproducción del espacio de núcleo de núcleo Hilbert (RKHS) que da lugar al diseño experimental de el núcleo laplaciano (KLOD). Para los puntos de datos dados x1, · · ·, xm ∈ X con un núcleo Mercer definido positivo K: x × x → R, existe un RKHS HK único de funciones valoradas reales en X. Deje que KT (s) sea la función de S obtenida fijando T y permitiendo KT (s).= K (s, t). HK consiste en todas las combinaciones lineales finitas de la forma l i = 1 αikti con ti ∈ X y límites de funciones tales a medida que el Ti se vuelve denso en X. Tenemos ks, kt hk = k (s, t).4.1 Derivación de LOD en la reproducción del espacio del núcleo Hilbert Considere el problema de optimización (5) en RKHS. Por lo tanto, buscamos una función f ∈ Hk de tal manera que la siguiente función objetivo se minimice: min f∈Hk k i = 1 f (zi) −yi 2 + λ1 2 m i, j = 1 f (xi) −f (xj) 2SiJ+λ2 F 2 HK (12) Tenemos la siguiente proposición. Proposición 4.1. Sea h = {m i = 1 αik (·, xi) | αi ∈ R} Sea un subespacio de HK, la solución al problema (12) está en H. prueba. Sea H⊥ el complemento ortogonal de H, es decir, HK = H ⊕ H⊥. Por lo tanto, para cualquier función f ∈ Hk, tiene descomposición ortogonal de la siguiente manera: f = fh + fh⊥ ahora, evaluemos f en xi: f (xi) = f, kxi hk = fh + fh⊥, kxi hk = fh,Kxi hk + fh⊥, kxi hk observa que kxi ∈ H mientras fh⊥ ∈ H⊥. Esto implica que FH⊥, KXI HK = 0. Por lo tanto, f (xi) = fh, kxi hk = fh (xi) Esto completa la prueba. La Proposición 4.1 nos dice que el minimizador del problema (12) admite una representación F ∗ = M I = 1 αik (·, xi). Consulte [2] para ver los detalles. Sea φ: rd → h un mapa de características del espacio de entrada rd a h, y k (xi, xj) = <φ (xi), φ (xj)>. Deje que X denote la matriz de datos en RKHS, x = (φ (x1), φ (x2), · · ·, φ (xm)). Del mismo modo, definimos z = (φ (z1), φ (z2), · · ·, φ (zk)). Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización en RKHS se puede escribir de la siguiente manera: Min Z TR XT ZZT + λ1XLXT + λ2I −1 x (13) Dado que la función de mapeo φ es generalmente desconocida, no hay una forma directa de resolver el problema (13). A continuación, aplicamos trucos de kernel para resolver este problema de optimización. Sea X-1 el inverso Moore-Penrose (también conocido como pseudo inverso) de X. Por lo tanto, tenemos: xt zzt + λ1xlxt + λ2i −1 x = xt xx - 1 zzt + λ1xlxt + λ2i −1 (xt) −1 xt x = xt x zzt x + λ1xlxt x + λ2x −1 (xt) −1Xt x = xt x xt zzt x + λ1xt xlxt x + λ2xt x −1 xt x = kxx kxzkzxx + λ1kxxxlkxx + λ2kxx −1 kxx donde kxx es una matriz m × m (kxx, ij = k (xi, xj)), kxzes una matriz m × k (kxz, ij = k (xi, zj)), y kzx es una matriz K × m (kzx, ij = k (zi, xj)). Por lo tanto, el diseño óptimo de Kernel Laplacian se puede definir de la siguiente manera: Definición 2. Diseño óptimo de Kernel Laplacian Minz = (Z1, ···, Zk) TR KXX KXZKZX + λ1KXXLKXX λ2KXX −1 KXX (14) 4.2 Esquema de optimización En esta subsección, discutimos cómo resolver los problemas de optimización (11) y (14). Particularmente, si seleccionamos un núcleo lineal para Klod, entonces se reduce a LOD. Por lo tanto, nos centraremos en el problema (14) en el siguiente. Se puede demostrar que el problema de optimización (14) es NP-HARD. En esta subsección, desarrollamos un enfoque codicioso secuencial simple para resolver (14). Supongamos que se han seleccionado N puntos, denotados por una matriz Zn = (Z1, · · ·, Zn). El (n+1) -th Point Zn+1 se puede seleccionar resolviendo el siguiente problema de optimización: Max Zn+1 = (Zn, Zn+1) TR KXX KXZN+1 KZN+1X+λ1KXXLKXX+λ2KXX −1 KXX (15) Las matrices de núcleo KXZN+1 y KZN+1X se pueden reescribir de la siguiente manera: KXZN+1 = KXZN, KXZN+1, KZN+1X = KZNX KZN+1X Por lo tanto, tenemos: KXZN+1 KZN+1X = KXZN KZNX+ Kxzn + 1 kzn + 1x Definimos: a = kxzn kznx + λ1kxxlkxx + λ2kxx A solo depende de x y zn. Por lo tanto, el (n+1) -th Point Zn+1 viene dado por: Zn+1 = arg min zn+1 tr kxx a+kxzn+1 kzn+1x −1 kxx (16) Cada vez que seleccionamos un nuevo puntoZn+1, la matriz A se actualiza por: A ← A+KXZN+1 KZN+1X Si la función del núcleo se elige como producto interno k (x, y) = x, y, entonces HK es un espacio funcional lineal y elEl algoritmo se reduce a LOD.5. Recuperación de imágenes basada en el contenido utilizando el diseño óptimo de Laplacian En esta sección, describimos cómo aplicar el diseño óptimo de Laplacian a CBIR. Comenzamos con una breve descripción de la representación de imágenes utilizando características visuales de bajo nivel.5.1 Representación de imágenes de bajo nivel La representación de imágenes de bajo nivel es un problema crucial en CBIR. Las características visuales generales incluyen color, textura, forma, etc. Las características de color y textura son las características visuales más utilizadas en CBIR. En comparación con las características de color y textura, las características de forma generalmente se describen después de que las imágenes se han segmentado en regiones u objetos. Dado que la segmentación de imágenes robusta y precisa es difícil de lograr, el uso de características de forma para la recuperación de imágenes se ha limitado a aplicaciones especiales donde los objetos o regiones están fácilmente disponibles. En este trabajo, combinamos un histograma de color 64 dimensional y un momento de textura de color de 64 dimensiones (CTM, [15]) para representar las imágenes. El histograma de color se calcula usando contenedores 4 × 4 × 4 en el espacio HSV. El momento de la textura del color es propuesto por Yu et al.[15], que integra las características de color y textura de la imagen en forma compacta. CTM adopta la transformación local de Fourier como un esquema de representación de textura y deriva ocho mapas característicos para describir diferentes aspectos de las relaciones de concurrencia de píxeles de imagen en cada canal del espacio de color (SVCOSH, SVSINH, V). Luego, CTM calcula el primer y segundo momento de estos mapas como una representación de la distribución de píxeles de imagen de color natural. Consulte [15] para más detalles.5.2 Relevancia Comentarios REPARACIÓN DE REPARACIÓN DE RELAVANCIÓN RELAVANCIA es una de las técnicas más importantes para reducir la brecha entre las características visuales de bajo nivel y los conceptos semánticos de alto nivel [12]. Tradicionalmente, los comentarios de relevancia de los usuarios se utilizan para actualizar el vector de consulta o ajustar la ponderación de diferentes dimensiones. Este proceso puede verse como un proceso de aprendizaje en línea en el que el sistema de recuperación de imágenes actúa como alumno y el usuario actúa como maestro. El proceso de recuperación típico se describe de la siguiente manera: 1. El usuario envía un ejemplo de imagen de consulta al sistema. El sistema clasifica las imágenes en la base de datos de acuerdo con algunas métricas de distancia predefinidas y presenta al usuario las imágenes clasificadas.2. El sistema selecciona algunas imágenes de la base de datos y solicita al usuario que las etiqueta como relevantes o irrelevantes.3. El sistema utiliza la información de los usuarios proporcionados para volver a relajar las imágenes en la base de datos y devuelve al usuario las imágenes principales. Vaya al paso 2 hasta que el usuario esté satisfecho. Nuestro algoritmo de diseño óptimo de Laplacian se aplica en el segundo paso para seleccionar las imágenes más informativas. Una vez que obtenemos las etiquetas de las imágenes seleccionadas por LOD, aplicamos la regresión regularizada de Laplacian (LRR, [2]) para resolver el problema de optimización (3) y construir el clasificador. El clasificador se usa para volver a clasificar las imágenes en la base de datos. Tenga en cuenta que, para reducir la complejidad computacional, no usamos todas las imágenes no etiquetadas en la base de datos, sino solo aquellas dentro de los 500 mejores devoluciones de iteración anterior.6. Resultados experimentales En esta sección, evaluamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto en una base de datos de imágenes grandes. Para demostrar la efectividad de nuestro algoritmo LOD propuesto, lo comparamos con la regresión regularizada laplaciana (LRR, [2]), la máquina de vectores de soporte (SVM), el aprendizaje activo de la máquina de vectores de soporte (SVMactive) [14] y el diseño óptimo A (A-Optimal (Aod). Tanto SVMactive, AOD como LOD son algoritmos de aprendizaje activos, mientras que LRR y SVM son algoritmos de clasificación estándar. SVM solo utiliza las imágenes etiquetadas, mientras que LRR es un algoritmo de aprendizaje semi-supervisado que utiliza imágenes etiquetadas y sin etiqueta. Para Svmactive, AOD y LOD, se seleccionan 10 imágenes de capacitación por los algoritmos en cada iteración. Mientras que para LRR y SVM, utilizamos las 10 imágenes principales como datos de entrenamiento. Sería importante tener en cuenta que SVMactive se basa en la SVM ordinaria, LOD se basa en LRR y AOD se basa en la regresión ordinaria. Los parámetros λ1 y λ2 en nuestro algoritmo LOD se establecen empíricamente para ser 0.001 y 0.00001. Para los algoritmos LRR y LOD, utilizamos la misma estructura gráfica (ver Ec. 4) y establecemos que el valor de P (número de vecinos más cercanos) sea 5. Comenzamos con un simple ejemplo sintético para dar alguna intuición sobre cómo funciona LOD.6.1 Ejemplo sintético simple Se da un ejemplo sintético simple en la Figura 1. El conjunto de datos contiene dos círculos. AOD y LOD seleccionan ocho puntos. Como se puede ver, todos los puntos seleccionados por AOD son del Big Circle, mientras que LOD selecciona cuatro puntos del Big Circle y cuatro del pequeño círculo. Los números junto a los puntos seleccionados denotan sus órdenes que se seleccionarán. Claramente, los puntos seleccionados por nuestro algoritmo LOD pueden representar mejor el conjunto de datos original. No comparamos nuestro algoritmo con SVMactive porque SVMactive no se puede aplicar en este caso debido a la falta de puntos etiquetados.6.2 Diseño experimental de recuperación de imágenes La base de datos de imágenes que utilizamos consta de 7,900 imágenes de 79 categorías semánticas, del conjunto de datos de Corel. Es un conjunto de imágenes grande y heterogéneo. Cada imagen se representa como un vector de 128 dimensiones como se describe en la Sección 5.1. La Figura 2 muestra algunas imágenes de muestra. Para exhibir las ventajas de usar nuestro algoritmo, necesitamos una forma confiable de evaluar el rendimiento de la recuperación y las comparaciones con otros algoritmos. Enumeramos diferentes aspectos del diseño experimental a continuación.6.2.1 Métricas de evaluación Utilizamos la curva de precisión de alcance y la tasa de precisión [10] para evaluar la efectividad de los algoritmos de recuperación de imágenes. El alcance se especifica mediante el número (n) de las imágenes de alto rango presentadas al usuario. La precisión es la relación del número de imágenes relevantes presentadas al usuario al (a) conjunto de datos 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (b) AOD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (c) LOD Figura 1: DatosSelección por algoritmos de aprendizaje activo. Los números junto a los puntos seleccionados denotan sus órdenes que se seleccionarán. Claramente, los puntos seleccionados por nuestro algoritmo LOD pueden representar mejor el conjunto de datos original. Tenga en cuenta que el algoritmo SVMactive no se puede aplicar en este caso debido a la falta de puntos etiquetados.(a) (b) (c) Figura 2: Imágenes de muestra de Bead de categoría, elefante y barco.Alcance N. La curva de precisión de alcance describe la precisión con varios ámbitos y, por lo tanto, proporciona una evaluación general del rendimiento de los algoritmos. Por otro lado, la tasa de precisión enfatiza la precisión en un valor particular del alcance. En general, es apropiado presentar 20 imágenes en una pantalla. Poner más imágenes en una pantalla puede afectar la calidad de las imágenes presentadas. Por lo tanto, la precisión en el top 20 (n = 20) es especialmente importante. En los sistemas de recuperación de imágenes del mundo real, la imagen de consulta generalmente no está en la base de datos de imágenes. Para simular dicho entorno, utilizamos una validación cruzada de cinco veces para evaluar los algoritmos. Más precisamente, dividimos toda la base de datos de la imagen en cinco subconjuntos con igual tamaño. Por lo tanto, hay 20 imágenes por categoría en cada subconjunto. En cada ejecución de validación cruzada, se selecciona un subconjunto como conjunto de consultas, y los otros cuatro subconjuntos se utilizan como base de datos para la recuperación. La curva de precisión de Precisions y la tasa de precisión se calculan promediando los resultados de la validación cruzada de cinco veces.6.2.2 Esquema de retroalimentación de relevancia automática Diseñamos un esquema de retroalimentación automática para modelar el proceso de recuperación. Para cada consulta enviada, nuestro sistema recupera y clasifica las imágenes en la base de datos.Se seleccionaron 10 imágenes de la base de datos para el etiquetado de los usuarios y el sistema utiliza la información de la etiqueta para volver a clasificar. Tenga en cuenta que las imágenes que se han seleccionado en iteraciones anteriores se excluyen de las selecciones posteriores. Para cada consulta, el mecanismo de retroalimentación de relevancia automática se realiza para cuatro iteraciones. Es importante tener en cuenta que el esquema de retroalimentación de relevancia automática utilizado aquí es diferente de los descritos en [8], [11]. En [8], [11], las cuatro principales imágenes relevantes e irrelevantes se seleccionaron como imágenes de retroalimentación. Sin embargo, esto puede no ser práctico. En los sistemas de recuperación de imágenes del mundo real, es posible que la mayoría de las imágenes mejor clasificadas sean relevantes (o irrelevantes). Por lo tanto, es difícil para el usuario encontrar cuatro imágenes relevantes e irrelevantes. Es más razonable que los usuarios proporcionen información de retroalimentación solo en las 10 imágenes seleccionadas por el sistema.6.3 Rendimiento de recuperación de imágenes En el mundo real, no es práctico exigir al usuario que proporcione muchas rondas de comentarios. El rendimiento de recuperación después de las dos primeras rondas de comentarios (especialmente la primera ronda) es más importante. La Figura 3 muestra las curvas de alcance de precisión promedio de los diferentes algoritmos para las dos primeras iteraciones de retroalimentación. Al comienzo de la recuperación, las distancias euclidianas en el espacio original de 128 dimensiones se utilizan para clasificar las imágenes en la base de datos. Después de que el usuario proporciona retroalimentación de relevancia, los algoritmos LRR, SVM, SVMactive, AOD y LOD se aplican para volver a clasificar las imágenes. Para reducir la complejidad del tiempo de los algoritmos de aprendizaje activo, no seleccionamos las imágenes más informativas de toda la base de datos sino de las 500 imágenes principales. Para LRR y SVM, se requiere que el usuario etiquete las 10 imágenes principales. Para SVMactive, AOD y LOD, el usuario debe etiquetar 10 imágenes más informativas seleccionadas por estos algoritmos. Tenga en cuenta que Svmactive solo puede ser AP (a) iteración de retroalimentación 1 (b) iteración de retroalimentación 2 Figura 3: Las curvas promedio de alcance de precisión de diferentes algoritmos para las dos primeras iteraciones de retroalimentación. El algoritmo LOD realiza lo mejor en todo el alcance. Tenga en cuenta que, en la primera ronda de retroalimentación, no se puede aplicar el algoritmo SVMactive. Aplica el SVM ordinario para construir el clasificador inicial.(a) Precisión en el top 10 (b) Precisión en el top 20 (c) Precisión en el top 30 Figura 4: Evaluación del rendimiento de los cinco algoritmos de aprendizaje para la recuperación de la imagen de retroalimentación de relevancia.(a) Precisión en la top 10, (b) Precisión en el top 20 y (c) precisión en el top 30. Como se puede ver, nuestro algoritmo LOD supera constantemente a los otros cuatro algoritmos.Capazado cuando el clasificador ya está construido. Por lo tanto, no se puede aplicar en la primera ronda y usamos el SVM estándar para construir el clasificador inicial. Como se puede ver, nuestro algoritmo LOD supera a los otros cuatro algoritmos en todo el alcance. Además, el algoritmo LRR funciona mejor que SVM. Esto se debe a que el algoritmo LRR hace un uso eficiente de las imágenes no etiquetadas al incorporar un regularizador de preservación de la localidad en la función objetivo de regresión ordinaria. El algoritmo AOD realiza lo peor. A medida que el alcance se hace más grande, la diferencia de rendimiento entre estos algoritmos se vuelve más pequeña. Al agregar iterativamente los comentarios de los usuarios, los resultados de precisión correspondientes (en el top 10, top 20 y top 30) de los cinco algoritmos se muestran respectivamente en la Figura 4. Como se puede ver, nuestro algoritmo LOD realiza lo mejor en todos los casos y el algoritmo LRR realiza el segundo mejor. Ambos dos algoritmos utilizan las imágenes sin etiquetar. Esto muestra que las imágenes no etiquetadas son útiles para descubrir la estructura geométrica intrínseca del espacio de la imagen y, por lo tanto, mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperación. En el mundo real, el usuario puede no estar dispuesto a proporcionar demasiadas comentarios de relevancia. Por lo tanto, el rendimiento de recuperación en las dos primeras rondas es especialmente importante. Como se puede ver, nuestro algoritmo LOD logra una mejora del rendimiento del 6.8% para los 10 mejores resultados, 5.2% para los 20 resultados principales y 4.1% para los 30 mejores resultados, en comparación con el segundo algoritmo mejor (LRR) después de las dos primeras rondas de comentarios de relevancia..6.4 Discusión Se han realizado sistemáticamente varios experimentos en la base de datos COREL. Nos gustaría resaltar varios puntos interesantes: 1. Está claro que el uso del aprendizaje activo es beneficioso en el dominio de recuperación de imágenes. Hay un aumento significativo en el rendimiento del uso de los métodos de aprendizaje activo. Especialmente, de los tres métodos de aprendizaje activo (SVMactive, AOD, LOD), nuestro algoritmo LOD propuesto funciona mejor.2. En muchas aplicaciones del mundo real, como la recuperación de la imagen de retroalimentación de relevancia, generalmente hay dos formas de reducir la tarea de etiquetado manual intensivo en mano de obra. Uno es un aprendizaje activo que selecciona las muestras más informativas para etiquetar, y la otra es el aprendizaje semi-supervisado que hace uso de las muestras no etiquetadas para mejorar el rendimiento del aprendizaje. Ambas estrategias se han estudiado ampliamente en el pasado [14], [7], [5], [8]. El trabajo presentado en este documento se centra en el aprendizaje activo, pero también aprovecha los progresos recientes en el aprendizaje semi-supervisado [2]. Específicamente, incorporamos un regularidad de preservación de la localidad en el marco de regresión estándar y encontramos las muestras más informativas con respecto a la nueva función objetivo. De esta manera, el aprendizaje activo y las técnicas de aprendizaje semi-supervisado se unifican sin problemas para aprender un clasificador óptimo.3. La técnica de retroalimentación de relevancia es crucial para la recuperación de imágenes. Para los cinco algoritmos, el rendimiento de la recuperación mejora con más comentarios proporcionados por el usuario.7. Conclusiones y trabajos futuros Este documento describe un nuevo algoritmo de aprendizaje activo, llamado diseño óptimo de Laplacian, para permitir una recuperación de imagen de retroalimentación de relevancia más efectiva. Nuestro algoritmo se basa en una función objetivo que simultáneamente minimiza el error empírico y preserva la estructura geométrica local del espacio de datos. Utilizando técnicas del diseño experimental, nuestro algoritmo encuentra las imágenes más informativas para etiquetar. Estas imágenes etiquetadas y las imágenes no etiquetadas en la base de datos se utilizan para aprender un clasificador. Los resultados experimentales en la base de datos COREL muestran que tanto el aprendizaje activo como el aprendizaje semi-supervisado pueden mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de la recuperación. En este artículo, consideramos el problema de recuperación de la imagen en los datos de imagen pequeños, estáticos y de dominio cerrado. Un dominio mucho más desafiante es la World Wide Web (www). Para la búsqueda de imágenes web, es posible recopilar una gran cantidad de información de clics del usuario. Esta información se puede utilizar naturalmente para construir el gráfico de afinidad en nuestro algoritmo. Sin embargo, la complejidad computacional en el escenario web puede convertirse en un problema crucial. Además, aunque nuestro interés principal en este documento se centra en la recuperación de la imagen de retroalimentación de relevancia, nuestros resultados también pueden ser de interés para los investigadores en el reconocimiento de Patten y el aprendizaje automático, especialmente cuando hay una gran cantidad de datos disponibles, pero solo se pueden etiquetar muestras limitadas..8.

        "Different observations have errors that are independent, but with equal variances σ2 .",
        "We define f(x) = wT x to be the learners output given input x and the weight vector w. Suppose we have a set of labeled sample points (z1, y1), · · · , (zk, yk), where yi is the label of zi.",
        "Thus, the maximum likelihood estimate for the weight vector, ˆw, is that which minimizes the sum squared error Jsse(w) = k i=1 wT zi − yi 2 (2) The estimate ˆw gives us an estimate of the output at a novel input: ˆy = ˆwT x.",
        "By Gauss-Markov theorem, we know that ˆw − w has a zero mean and a covariance matrix given by σ2 H−1 sse, where Hsse is the Hessian of Jsse(w) Hsse = ∂2 Jsse ∂w2 = k i=1 zizT i = ZZT where Z = (z1, z2, · · · , zk).",
        "The three most common scalar measures of the size of the parameter covariance matrix in optimal experimental design are: • D-optimal design: determinant of Hsse. • A-optimal design: trace of Hsse. • E-optimal design: maximum eigenvalue of Hsse.",
        "Since the computation of the determinant and eigenvalues of a matrix is much more expensive than the computation of matrix trace, A-optimal design is more efficient than the other two.",
        "Some recent work on experimental design can be found in [6], [16]. 3.",
        "LAPLACIAN OPTIMAL DESIGN Since the covariance matrix Hsse used in traditional approaches is only dependent on the measured samples, i.e. zis, these approaches fail to evaluate the expected errors on the unmeasured samples.",
        "In this Section, we introduce a novel active learning algorithm called Laplacian Optimal Design (LOD) which makes efficient use of both measured (labeled) and unmeasured (unlabeled) samples. 3.1 The Objective Function In many machine learning problems, it is natural to assume that if two points xi, xj are sufficiently close to each other, then their measurements (f(xi), f(xj)) are close as well.",
        "Let S be a similarity matrix.",

        "Please see [15] for details. 5.2 Relevance Feedback Image Retrieval Relevance feedback is one of the most important techniques to narrow down the gap between low level visual features and high level semantic concepts [12].",
        "Traditionally, the users relevance feedbacks are used to update the query vector or adjust the weighting of different dimensions.",
        "This process can be viewed as an on-line learning process in which the image retrieval system acts as a learner and the user acts as a teacher.",
        "They typical retrieval process is outlined as follows: 1.",
        "The user submits a query image example to the system.",
        "The system ranks the images in database according to some pre-defined distance metric and presents to the user the top ranked images. 2.",
        "The system selects some images from the database and request the user to label them as relevant or irrelevant. 3.",

        "Note that, in order to reduce the computational complexity, we do not use all the unlabeled images in the database but only those within top 500 returns of previous iteration. 6.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS In this section, we evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm on a large image database.",
        "To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed LOD algorithm, we compare it with Laplacian Regularized Regression (LRR, [2]), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Support Vector Machine Active Learning (SVMactive) [14], and A-Optimal Design (AOD).",
        "Both SVMactive, AOD, and LOD are active learning algorithms, while LRR and SVM are standard classification algorithms.",
        "SVM only makes use of the labeled images, while LRR is a semi-supervised learning algorithm which makes use of both labeled and unlabeled images.",
        "For SVMactive, AOD, and LOD, 10 training images are selected by the algorithms themselves at each iteration.",
        "While for LRR and SVM, we use the top 10 images as training data.",
        "It would be important to note that SVMactive is based on the ordinary SVM, LOD is based on LRR, and AOD is based on the ordinary regression.",
        "The parameters λ1 and λ2 in our LOD algorithm are empirically set to be 0.001 and 0.00001.",
        "For both LRR and LOD algorithms, we use the same graph structure (see Eq. 4) and set the value of p (number of nearest neighbors) to be 5.",
        "We begin with a simple synthetic example to give some intuition about how LOD works. 6.1 Simple Synthetic Example A simple synthetic example is given in Figure 1.",
        "The data set contains two circles.",
        "Eight points are selected by AOD and LOD.",
        "As can be seen, all the points selected by AOD are from the big circle, while LOD selects four points from the big circle and four from the small circle.",
        "The numbers beside the selected points denote their orders to be selected.",
        "Clearly, the points selected by our LOD algorithm can better represent the original data set.",
        "We did not compare our algorithm with SVMactive because SVMactive can not be applied in this case due to the lack of the labeled points. 6.2 Image Retrieval Experimental Design The image database we used consists of 7,900 images of 79 semantic categories, from COREL data set.",
        "It is a large and heterogeneous image set.",
        "Each image is represented as a 128-dimensional vector as described in Section 5.1.",
        "Figure 2 shows some sample images.",
        "To exhibit the advantages of using our algorithm, we need a reliable way of evaluating the retrieval performance and the comparisons with other algorithms.",
        "We list different aspects of the experimental design below. 6.2.1 Evaluation Metrics We use precision-scope curve and precision rate [10] to evaluate the effectiveness of the image retrieval algorithms.",
        "The scope is specified by the number (N) of top-ranked images presented to the user.",
        "The precision is the ratio of the number of relevant images presented to the user to the (a) Data set 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (b) AOD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (c) LOD Figure 1: Data selection by active learning algorithms.",
        "The numbers beside the selected points denote their orders to be selected.",
        "Clearly, the points selected by our LOD algorithm can better represent the original data set.",
        "Note that, the SVMactive algorithm can not be applied in this case due to the lack of labeled points. (a) (b) (c) Figure 2: Sample images from category bead, elephant, and ship. scope N. The precision-scope curve describes the precision with various scopes and thus gives an overall performance evaluation of the algorithms.",
        "On the other hand, the precision rate emphasizes the precision at a particular value of scope.",
        "In general, it is appropriate to present 20 images on a screen.",
        "Putting more images on a screen may affect the quality of the presented images.",
        "Therefore, the precision at top 20 (N = 20) is especially important.",
        "In real world image retrieval systems, the query image is usually not in the image database.",
        "To simulate such environment, we use five-fold cross validation to evaluate the algorithms.",
        "More precisely, we divide the whole image database into five subsets with equal size.",
        "Thus, there are 20 images per category in each subset.",
        "At each run of cross validation, one subset is selected as the query set, and the other four subsets are used as the database for retrieval.",
        "The precisionscope curve and precision rate are computed by averaging the results from the five-fold cross validation. 6.2.2 Automatic Relevance Feedback Scheme We designed an automatic feedback scheme to model the retrieval process.",
        "For each submitted query, our system retrieves and ranks the images in the database. 10 images were selected from the database for user labeling and the label information is used by the system for re-ranking.",
        "Note that, the images which have been selected at previous iterations are excluded from later selections.",
        "For each query, the automatic relevance feedback mechanism is performed for four iterations.",
        "It is important to note that the automatic relevance feedback scheme used here is different from the ones described in [8], [11].",
        "In [8], [11], the top four relevant and irrelevant images were selected as the feedback images.",
        "However, this may not be practical.",
        "In real world image retrieval systems, it is possible that most of the top-ranked images are relevant (or, irrelevant).",
        "Thus, it is difficult for the user to find both four relevant and irrelevant images.",
        "It is more reasonable for the users to provide feedback information only on the 10 images selected by the system. 6.3 Image Retrieval Performance In real world, it is not practical to require the user to provide many rounds of feedbacks.",
        "The retrieval performance after the first two rounds of feedbacks (especially the first round) is more important.",
        "Figure 3 shows the average precision-scope curves of the different algorithms for the first two feedback iterations.",
        "At the beginning of retrieval, the Euclidean distances in the original 128-dimensional space are used to rank the images in database.",
        "After the user provides relevance feedbacks, the LRR, SVM, SVMactive, AOD, and LOD algorithms are then applied to re-rank the images.",
        "In order to reduce the time complexity of active learning algorithms, we didnt select the most informative images from the whole database but from the top 500 images.",
        "For LRR and SVM, the user is required to label the top 10 images.",
        "For SVMactive, AOD, and LOD, the user is required to label 10 most informative images selected by these algorithms.",
        "Note that, SVMactive can only be ap(a) Feedback Iteration 1 (b) Feedback Iteration 2 Figure 3: The average precision-scope curves of different algorithms for the first two feedback iterations.",
        "The LOD algorithm performs the best on the entire scope.",
        "Note that, at the first round of feedback, the SVMactive algorithm can not be applied.",
        "It applies the ordinary SVM to build the initial classifier. (a) Precision at Top 10 (b) Precision at Top 20 (c) Precision at Top 30 Figure 4: Performance evaluation of the five learning algorithms for relevance feedback image retrieval. (a) Precision at top 10, (b) Precision at top 20, and (c) Precision at top 30.",
        "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm consistently outperforms the other four algorithms. plied when the classifier is already built.",
        "Therefore, it can not be applied at the first round and we use the standard SVM to build the initial classifier.",
        "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm outperforms the other four algorithms on the entire scope.",
        "Also, the LRR algorithm performs better than SVM.",
        "This is because that the LRR algorithm makes efficient use of the unlabeled images by incorporating a locality preserving regularizer into the ordinary regression objective function.",
        "The AOD algorithm performs the worst.",
        "As the scope gets larger, the performance difference between these algorithms gets smaller.",
        "By iteratively adding the users feedbacks, the corresponding precision results (at top 10, top 20, and top 30) of the five algorithms are respectively shown in Figure 4.",
        "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm performs the best in all the cases and the LRR algorithm performs the second best.",
        "Both of these two algorithms make use of the unlabeled images.",
        "This shows that the unlabeled images are helpful for discovering the intrinsic geometrical structure of the image space and therefore enhance the retrieval performance.",
        "In real world, the user may not be willing to provide too many relevance feedbacks.",
        "Therefore, the retrieval performance at the first two rounds are especially important.",
        "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm achieves 6.8% performance improvement for top 10 results, 5.2% for top 20 results, and 4.1% for top 30 results, comparing to the second best algorithm (LRR) after the first two rounds of relevance feedbacks. 6.4 Discussion Several experiments on Corel database have been systematically performed.",
        "We would like to highlight several interesting points: 1.",
        "It is clear that the use of active learning is beneficial in the image retrieval domain.",
        "There is a significant increase in performance from using the active learning methods.",
        "Especially, out of the three active learning methods (SVMactive, AOD, LOD), our proposed LOD algorithm performs the best. 2.",
        "In many real world applications like relevance feedback image retrieval, there are generally two ways of reducing labor-intensive manual labeling task.",
        "One is active learning which selects the most informative samples to label, and the other is semi-supervised learning which makes use of the unlabeled samples to enhance the learning performance.",
        "Both of these two strategies have been studied extensively in the past [14], [7], [5], [8].",
        "The work presented in this paper is focused on active learning, but it also takes advantage of the recent progresses on semi-supervised learning [2].",
        "Specifically, we incorporate a locality preserving regularizer into the standard regression framework and find the most informative samples with respect to the new objective function.",
        "In this way, the active learning and semi-supervised learning techniques are seamlessly unified for learning an optimal classifier. 3.",
        "The relevance feedback technique is crucial to image retrieval.",
        "For all the five algorithms, the retrieval performance improves with more feedbacks provided by the user. 7.",
        "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper describes a novel active learning algorithm, called Laplacian Optimal Design, to enable more effective relevance feedback image retrieval.",
        "Our algorithm is based on an objective function which simultaneously minimizes the empirical error and preserves the local geometrical structure of the data space.",
        "Using techniques from experimental design, our algorithm finds the most informative images to label.",
        "These labeled images and the unlabeled images in the database are used to learn a classifier.",
        "The experimental results on Corel database show that both active learning and semi-supervised learning can significantly improve the retrieval performance.",
        "In this paper, we consider the image retrieval problem on a small, static, and closed-domain image data.",
        "A much more challenging domain is the World Wide Web (WWW).",
        "For Web image search, it is possible to collect a large amount of user click information.",
        "This information can be naturally used to construct the affinity graph in our algorithm.",
        "However, the computational complexity in Web scenario may become a crucial issue.",
        "Also, although our primary interest in this paper is focused on relevance feedback image retrieval, our results may also be of interest to researchers in patten recognition and machine learning, especially when a large amount of data is available but only a limited samples can be labeled. 8.",

                "Putting more images on a screen may affect the quality of the presented images.",
                "Therefore, the precision at top 20 (N = 20) is especially important.",
                "In real world image retrieval systems, the query image is usually not in the image database.",
                "To simulate such environment, we use five-fold cross validation to evaluate the algorithms.",

                "In [8], [11], the top four relevant and irrelevant images were selected as the feedback images.",
                "However, this may not be practical.",
                "In real world image retrieval systems, it is possible that most of the top-ranked images are relevant (or, irrelevant).",

                "The retrieval performance after the first two rounds of feedbacks (especially the first round) is more important.",

                "After the user provides relevance feedbacks, the LRR, SVM, SVMactive, AOD, and LOD algorithms are then applied to re-rank the images.",
                "In order to reduce the time complexity of <br>active learning</br> algorithms, we didnt select the most informative images from the whole database but from the top 500 images.",
                "For LRR and SVM, the user is required to label the top 10 images.",
                "For SVMactive, AOD, and LOD, the user is required to label 10 most informative images selected by these algorithms.",

                "Also, the LRR algorithm performs better than SVM.",
                "This is because that the LRR algorithm makes efficient use of the unlabeled images by incorporating a locality preserving regularizer into the ordinary regression objective function.",
                "The AOD algorithm performs the worst.",
                "As the scope gets larger, the performance difference between these algorithms gets smaller.",
                "By iteratively adding the users feedbacks, the corresponding precision results (at top 10, top 20, and top 30) of the five algorithms are respectively shown in Figure 4.",
                "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm performs the best in all the cases and the LRR algorithm performs the second best.",
                "Both of these two algorithms make use of the unlabeled images.",
                "This shows that the unlabeled images are helpful for discovering the intrinsic geometrical structure of the image space and therefore enhance the retrieval performance.",
                "In real world, the user may not be willing to provide too many relevance feedbacks.",
                "Therefore, the retrieval performance at the first two rounds are especially important.",
                "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm achieves 6.8% performance improvement for top 10 results, 5.2% for top 20 results, and 4.1% for top 30 results, comparing to the second best algorithm (LRR) after the first two rounds of relevance feedbacks. 6.4 Discussion Several experiments on Corel database have been systematically performed.",

                "Especially, out of the three <br>active learning</br> methods (SVMactive, AOD, LOD), our proposed LOD algorithm performs the best. 2.",
                "In many real world applications like relevance feedback image retrieval, there are generally two ways of reducing labor-intensive manual labeling task.",
                "One is <br>active learning</br> which selects the most informative samples to label, and the other is semi-supervised learning which makes use of the unlabeled samples to enhance the learning performance.",
                "Both of these two strategies have been studied extensively in the past [14], [7], [5], [8].",

                "Therefore, the precision at top 20 (N = 20) is especially important.",
                "In real world image retrieval systems, the query image is usually not in the image database.",

                "In real world image retrieval systems, it is possible that most of the top-ranked images are relevant (or, irrelevant).",

                "For LRR and SVM, the user is required to label the top 10 images.",
                "For SVMactive, AOD, and LOD, the user is required to label 10 most informative images selected by these algorithms.",

                "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm outperforms the other four algorithms on the entire scope.",
                "Also, the LRR algorithm performs better than SVM.",
                "This is because that the LRR algorithm makes efficient use of the unlabeled images by incorporating a locality preserving regularizer into the ordinary regression objective function.",
                "The AOD algorithm performs the worst.",
                "As the scope gets larger, the performance difference between these algorithms gets smaller.",
                "By iteratively adding the users feedbacks, the corresponding precision results (at top 10, top 20, and top 30) of the five algorithms are respectively shown in Figure 4.",
                "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm performs the best in all the cases and the LRR algorithm performs the second best.",
                "Both of these two algorithms make use of the unlabeled images.",
                "This shows that the unlabeled images are helpful for discovering the intrinsic geometrical structure of the image space and therefore enhance the retrieval performance.",
                "In real world, the user may not be willing to provide too many relevance feedbacks.",
                "Therefore, the retrieval performance at the first two rounds are especially important.",
                "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm achieves 6.8% performance improvement for top 10 results, 5.2% for top 20 results, and 4.1% for top 30 results, comparing to the second best algorithm (LRR) after the first two rounds of relevance feedbacks. 6.4 Discussion Several experiments on Corel database have been systematically performed.",

                "In many real world applications like relevance feedback image retrieval, there are generally two ways of reducing labor-intensive manual labeling task.",
                "One is active learning which selects the most informative samples to label, and the other is semi-supervised learning which makes use of the unlabeled samples to enhance the learning performance.",
                "Both of these two strategies have been studied extensively in the past [14], [7], [5], [8].",
                "The work presented in this paper is focused on active learning, but it also takes advantage of the recent progresses on semi-supervised learning [2].",

                "The precision is the ratio of the number of relevant images presented to the user to the (a) Data set 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (b) AOD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (c) LOD Figure 1: Data selection by active learning algorithms.",
                "The numbers beside the selected points denote their orders to be selected.",
                "Clearly, the points selected by our LOD algorithm can better represent the original data set.",
                "Note that, the SVMactive algorithm can not be applied in this case due to the lack of labeled points. (a) (b) (c) Figure 2: Sample images from category bead, elephant, and ship. scope N. The precision-scope curve describes the precision with various scopes and thus gives an overall performance evaluation of the algorithms.",
                "On the other hand, the precision rate emphasizes the precision at a particular value of scope.",
                "In general, it is appropriate to present 20 images on a screen.",
                "Putting more images on a screen may affect the quality of the presented images.",
                "Therefore, the precision at top 20 (N = 20) is especially important.",
                "In real world image retrieval systems, the query image is usually not in the image database.",
                "To simulate such environment, we use five-fold cross validation to evaluate the algorithms.",
                "More precisely, we divide the whole image database into five subsets with equal size.",
                "Thus, there are 20 images per category in each subset.",
                "At each run of cross validation, one subset is selected as the query set, and the other four subsets are used as the database for retrieval.",
                "The precisionscope curve and precision rate are computed by averaging the results from the five-fold cross validation. 6.2.2 Automatic Relevance Feedback Scheme We designed an automatic feedback scheme to model the retrieval process.",
                "For each submitted query, our system retrieves and ranks the images in the database. 10 images were selected from the database for user labeling and the label information is used by the system for re-ranking.",

                "It is important to note that the automatic relevance feedback scheme used here is different from the ones described in [8], [11].",
                "In [8], [11], the top four relevant and irrelevant images were selected as the feedback images.",

                "It is more reasonable for the users to provide feedback information only on the 10 images selected by the system. 6.3 Image Retrieval Performance In real world, it is not practical to require the user to provide many rounds of feedbacks.",
                "The retrieval performance after the first two rounds of feedbacks (especially the first round) is more important.",
                "Figure 3 shows the average precision-scope curves of the different algorithms for the first two feedback iterations.",
                "At the beginning of retrieval, the Euclidean distances in the original 128-dimensional space are used to rank the images in database.",
                "After the user provides relevance feedbacks, the LRR, SVM, SVMactive, AOD, and LOD algorithms are then applied to re-rank the images.",
                "In order to reduce the time complexity of active learning algorithms, we didnt select the most informative images from the whole database but from the top 500 images.",
                "For LRR and SVM, the user is required to label the top 10 images.",
                "For SVMactive, AOD, and LOD, the user is required to label 10 most informative images selected by these algorithms.",

                "Therefore, it can not be applied at the first round and we use the standard SVM to build the initial classifier.",
                "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm outperforms the other four algorithms on the entire scope.",
                "Also, the LRR algorithm performs better than SVM.",
                "This is because that the LRR algorithm makes efficient use of the unlabeled images by incorporating a locality preserving regularizer into the ordinary regression objective function.",
                "The AOD algorithm performs the worst.",
                "As the scope gets larger, the performance difference between these algorithms gets smaller.",
                "By iteratively adding the users feedbacks, the corresponding precision results (at top 10, top 20, and top 30) of the five algorithms are respectively shown in Figure 4.",
                "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm performs the best in all the cases and the LRR algorithm performs the second best.",
                "Both of these two algorithms make use of the unlabeled images.",
                "This shows that the unlabeled images are helpful for discovering the intrinsic geometrical structure of the image space and therefore enhance the retrieval performance.",
                "In real world, the user may not be willing to provide too many relevance feedbacks.",
                "Therefore, the retrieval performance at the first two rounds are especially important.",
                "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm achieves 6.8% performance improvement for top 10 results, 5.2% for top 20 results, and 4.1% for top 30 results, comparing to the second best algorithm (LRR) after the first two rounds of relevance feedbacks. 6.4 Discussion Several experiments on Corel database have been systematically performed.",

                "In many real world applications like relevance feedback image retrieval, there are generally two ways of reducing labor-intensive manual labeling task.",
                "One is active learning which selects the most informative samples to label, and the other is semi-supervised learning which makes use of the unlabeled samples to enhance the learning performance.",
                "Both of these two strategies have been studied extensively in the past [14], [7], [5], [8].",

                "This information can be naturally used to construct the affinity graph in our algorithm.",
                "However, the computational complexity in Web scenario may become a crucial issue.",
                "Also, although our primary interest in this paper is focused on relevance feedback image retrieval, our results may also be of interest to researchers in patten recognition and machine learning, especially when a large amount of data is available but only a limited samples can be labeled. 8.",

                "Also, the LRR algorithm performs better than SVM.",

                "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm performs the best in all the cases and the LRR algorithm performs the second best.",
                "Both of these two algorithms make use of the unlabeled images.",
                "This shows that the unlabeled images are helpful for discovering the <br>intrinsic geometrical structure</br> of the image space and therefore enhance the retrieval performance.",

                "In many real world applications like relevance feedback image retrieval, there are generally two ways of reducing labor-intensive manual labeling task.",
                "One is active learning which selects the most informative samples to label, and the other is semi-supervised learning which makes use of the unlabeled samples to enhance the learning performance.",
                "Both of these two strategies have been studied extensively in the past [14], [7], [5], [8].",

                "The precision is the ratio of the number of relevant images presented to the user to the (a) Data set 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (b) AOD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (c) LOD Figure 1: Data selection by active learning algorithms.",
                "The numbers beside the selected points denote their orders to be selected.",

(a) (b) (c) Figure 2: Sample images from category bead, elephant, and ship. scope N. The precision-scope curve describes the precision with various scopes and thus gives an overall performance evaluation of the algorithms.",
                "On the other hand, the precision rate emphasizes the precision at a particular value of scope.",
                "In general, it is appropriate to present 20 images on a screen.",
                "Putting more images on a screen may affect the quality of the presented images.",
                "Therefore, the precision at top 20 (N = 20) is especially important.",
                "In real world image retrieval systems, the query image is usually not in the image database.",
                "To simulate such environment, we use five-fold cross validation to evaluate the algorithms.",
                "More precisely, we divide the whole image database into five subsets with equal size.",

                "At each run of cross validation, one subset is selected as the query set, and the other four subsets are used as the database for retrieval.",
                "The precisionscope curve and precision rate are computed by averaging the results from the five-fold cross validation. 6.2.2 Automatic Relevance Feedback Scheme We designed an automatic feedback scheme to model the retrieval process.",
                "For each submitted query, our system retrieves and ranks the images in the database. 10 images were selected from the database for user labeling and the label information is used by the system for re-ranking.",

                "It is more reasonable for the users to provide feedback information only on the 10 images selected by the system. 6.3 Image Retrieval Performance In real world, it is not practical to require the user to provide many rounds of feedbacks.",
                "The retrieval performance after the first two rounds of feedbacks (especially the first round) is more important.",

                "After the user provides relevance feedbacks, the LRR, SVM, SVMactive, AOD, and LOD algorithms are then applied to re-rank the images.",
                "In order to reduce the time complexity of active learning algorithms, we didnt select the most informative images from the whole database but from the top 500 images.",
                "For LRR and SVM, the user is required to label the top 10 images.",
                "For SVMactive, AOD, and LOD, the user is required to label 10 most informative images selected by these algorithms.",

                "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm outperforms the other four algorithms on the entire scope.",
                "Also, the LRR algorithm performs better than SVM.",
                "This is because that the LRR algorithm makes efficient use of the unlabeled images by incorporating a locality preserving regularizer into the ordinary regression objective function.",
                "The AOD algorithm performs the worst.",
                "As the scope gets larger, the performance difference between these algorithms gets smaller.",
                "By iteratively adding the users feedbacks, the corresponding precision results (at top 10, top 20, and top 30) of the five algorithms are respectively shown in Figure 4.",
                "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm performs the best in all the cases and the LRR algorithm performs the second best.",
                "Both of these two algorithms make use of the unlabeled images.",
                "This shows that the unlabeled images are helpful for discovering the intrinsic geometrical structure of the image space and therefore enhance the retrieval performance.",
                "In real world, the user may not be willing to provide too many relevance feedbacks.",
                "Therefore, the retrieval performance at the first two rounds are especially important.",
                "As can be seen, our LOD algorithm achieves 6.8% performance improvement for top 10 results, 5.2% for top 20 results, and 4.1% for top 30 results, comparing to the second best algorithm (LRR) after the first two rounds of relevance feedbacks. 6.4 Discussion Several experiments on Corel database have been systematically performed.",

                "In many real world applications like relevance feedback image retrieval, there are generally two ways of reducing labor-intensive manual labeling task.",
                "One is active learning which selects the most informative samples to label, and the other is semi-supervised learning which makes use of the unlabeled samples to enhance the learning performance.",
                "Both of these two strategies have been studied extensively in the past [14], [7], [5], [8].",
                "The work presented in this paper is focused on active learning, but it also takes advantage of the recent progresses on semi-supervised learning [2].",

                "This information can be naturally used to construct the affinity graph in our algorithm.",
                "However, the computational complexity in Web scenario may become a crucial issue.",
                "Also, although our primary interest in this paper is focused on relevance feedback image retrieval, our results may also be of interest to researchers in <br>patten recognition</br> and machine learning, especially when a large amount of data is available but only a limited samples can be labeled. 8.",
