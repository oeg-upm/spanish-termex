The standardization of grids based on web services has resulted in the need for scalable web service discovery mechanisms to be deployed in grids Even though UDDI has been the de facto industry standard for web-services discovery, imposed requirements of tight-replication among registries and lack of autonomous control has severely hindered its widespread deployment and usage. With the advent of grid computing the scalability issue of UDDI will become a roadblock that will prevent its deployment in grids. In this paper we present our distributed web-service discovery architecture, called DUDE (Distributed UDDI Deployment Engine). DUDE leverages DHT (Distributed Hash Tables) as a rendezvous mechanism between multiple UDDI registries. DUDE enables consumers to query multiple registries, still at the same time allowing organizations to have autonomous control over their registries.. Based on preliminary prototype on PlanetLab, we believe that DUDE architecture can support effective distribution of UDDI registries thereby making UDDI more robust and also addressing its scaling issues. Furthermore, The DUDE architecture for scalable distribution can be applied beyond UDDI to any Grid Service Discovery mechanism.

MGC 05, November 28- December 2, 2005 Grenoble , France discovery mechanisms to be deployed in grids. Grid discovery services provide the ability to monitor and discover resources and services on grids. They provide the ability to query and subscribe to resource/service information. In addition, threshold traps might be required to indicate specific change in existing conditions. The state of the data needs to be maintained in a soft state so that the most recent information is always available. The information gathered needs to be provided to variety of systems for the purpose of either utilizing the grid or proving summary information. However, the fundamental problem is the need to be scalable to handle huge amounts of data from multiple sources. The web services community has addressed the need for service discovery, before grids were anticipated, via an industry standard called UDDI. However, even though UDDI has been the de facto industry standard for web-services discovery, imposed requirements of tight-replication among registries and lack of autonomous control, among other things has severely hindered its widespread deployment and usage [7]. With the advent of grid computing the scalability issue with UDDI will become a roadblock that will prevent its deployment in grids. This paper tackles the scalability issue and a way to find services across multiple registries in UDDI by developing a distributed web services discovery architecture. Distributing UDDI functionality can be achieved in multiple ways and perhaps using different distributed computing infrastructure/platforms (e.g., CORBA, DCE, etc.). In this paper we explore how Distributed Hash Table (DHT) technology can be leveraged to develop a scalable distributed web services discovery architecture. A DHT is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed system that forms a structured overlay allowing more efficient routing than the underlying network. This crucial design choice is motivated by two factors. The first motivating factor is the inherent simplicity of the put/get abstraction that DHTs provide, which makes it easy to rapidly build applications on top of DHTs. We recognize that having just this abstraction may not suffice for all distributed applications, but for the objective at hand, works very well as will become clear later. Other distributed computing platforms/middleware while providing more functionality have much higher overhead and complexity. The second motivating factor stems from the fact that DHTs are relatively new tool for building distributed applications and we would like to test its potential by applying it to the problem of distributing UDDI. In the next section, we provide a brief overview of grid information services, UDDI and its limitations, which is followed by an overview of DHTs in Section 3. Section 4 describes our proposed architecture with details on use cases. In Section 5, we Article 2 describe our current implementation, followed by our findings in Section 6. Section 7 discusses the related work in this area and Section 8 contains our concluding remarks. 2. BACKGROUND 2.1 Grid Service Discovery Grid computing is based on standards which use web services technology. In the architecture presented in [6], the service discovery function is assigned to a specialized Grid service called Registry. The implementation of the web service version of the Monitoring and Discovery Service (WS MDS), also known as the MDS4 component of the Globus Toolkit version 4 (GT4), includes such a registry in the form of the Index service Resource and service properties are collected and indexed by this service. Its basic function makes it similar to UDDI registry. To attain scalability, Index services from different Globus containers can register with each other in a hierarchical fashion to aggregate data. This approach for attaining scalability works best in hierarchical Virtual Organizations (VO), and expanding a search to find sufficient number of matches involves traversing the hierarchy. Specifically, this approach is not a good match for systems that try to exploit the convergence of grid and peer-to-peer computing [5]. 2.2 UDDI Beyond grid computing, the problem of service discovery needs to be addressed more generally in the web services community. Again, scalability is a major concern since millions of buyers looking for specific services need to find all the potential sellers of the service who can meet their needs. Although there are different ways of doing this, the web services standards committees address this requirement through a specification called UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration). A UDDI registry enables a business to enter three types of information in a UDDI registry - white pages, yellow pages and green pages. UDDIs intent is to function as a registry for services just as the yellow pages is a registry for businesses. Just like in Yellow pages, companies register themselves and their services under different categories. In UDDI, White Pages are a listing of the business entities. Green pages represent the technical information that is necessary to invoke a given service. Thus, by browsing a UDDI registry, a developer should be able to locate a service and a company and find out how to invoke the service. When UDDI was initially offered, it provided a lot of potential. However, today we find that UDDI has not been widely deployed in the Internet. In fact, the only known uses of UDDI are what are known as private UDDI registries within an enterprises boundaries. The readers can refer to [7] for a recent article that discusses the shortcomings of UDDI and the properties of an ideal service registry. Improvement of the UDDI standard is continuing in full force and UDDI version 3 (V3) was recently approved as an OASIS Standard. However, UDDI today has issues that have not been addressed, such as scalability and autonomy of individual registries. UDDI V3 provides larger support for multi-registry environments based on portability of keys By allowing keys to be re-registered in multiple registries, the ability to link registries in various topologies is effectively enabled. However, no normative description of these topologies is provided in the UDDI specification at this point. The improvements within UDDI V3 that allow support for multi-registry environments are significant and open the possibility for additional research around how multiregistry environments may be deployed. A recommended deployment scenario proposed by the UDDI V3.0.2 Specification is to use the UDDI Business Registries as root registries, and it is possible to enable this using our solution. 2.3 Distributed Hash Tables A Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed system that forms a structured overlay allowing more efficient routing than the underlying network. It maintains a collection of key-value pairs on the nodes participating in this graph structure. For our deployment, a key is the hash of a keyword from a service name or description. There will be multiple values for this key, one for each service containing the keyword. Just like any other hash table data structure, it provides a simple interface consisting of put() and get() operations. This has to be done with robustness because of the transient nature of nodes in P2P systems. The value stored in the DHT can be any object or a copy or reference to it. The DHT keys are obtained from a large identifier space. A hash function, such as MD5 or SHA-1, is applied to an object name to obtain its DHT key. Nodes in a DHT are also mapped into the same identifier space by applying the hash function to their identifier, such as IP address and port number, or public key. The identifier space is assigned to the nodes in a distributed and deterministic fashion, so that routing and lookup can be performed efficiently. The nodes of a DHT maintain links to some of the other nodes in the DHT. The pattern of these links is known as the DHTs geometry. For example, in the Bamboo DHT [11], and in the Pastry DHT [8] on which Bamboo is based, nodes maintain links to neighboring nodes and to other distant nodes found in a routing table. The routing table entry at row i and column j, denoted Ri[j], is another node whose identifier matches its own in first i digits, and whose (i + 1)st digit is j. The routing table allows efficient overlay routing. Bamboo, like all DHTs, specifies algorithms to be followed when a node joins the overlay network, or when a node fails or leaves the network The geometry must be maintained even when this rate is high. To attain consistent routing or lookup, a DHT key must be routed to the node with the numerically closest identifier. For details of how the routing tables are constructed and maintained, the reader is referred to [8, 11]. 3. PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE OF DHT BASED UDDI REGISTRY HIERARCHIES As mentioned earlier, we propose to build a distributed UDDI system on top of a DHT infrastructure. This choice is primarily motivated by the simplicity of the put/get abstraction that DHTs provide, which is powerful enough for the task at hand, especially since we plan to validate our approach with an implementation running on PlanetLab [9]. A secondary motivation is to understand deployment issues with DHT based systems. Several applications have been built as overlays using DHTs, such as distributed file storage, databases, publish-subscribe systems and content distribution networks. In our case, we are building a DHT based overlay network of UDDI registries, where the DHT acts as a rendezvous network that connects multiple registries. In the grid computing scenario, an overlay network of multiple UDDI registries seems to an interesting alternative to the UDDI public Article 2 registries currently maintained by Microsoft, IBM, SAP and NTT. In addition, our aim is to not change any of the UDDI interfaces for clients as well as publishers. Figure 1 highlights the proposed architecture for the DHT based UDDI Registry framework. UDDI nodes are replicated in a UDDI registry as per the current UDDI standard. However, each local registry has a local proxy registry that mediates between the local UDDI registry and the DHT Service. The DHT service is the glue that connects the Proxy Registries together and facilitates searching across registries. Figure 1: DUDE Architecture Service information can be dispersed to several UDDI registries to promote scalability. The proxy registry publishes, performs queries and deletes information from the dispersed UDDI registries. However, the scope of the queries is limited to relevant registries. The DHT provides information about the relevant registries. The core idea in the architecture is to populate DHT nodes with the necessary information from the proxies which enables easy and ubiquitous searching when queries are made. When a new service is added to a registry, all potential search terms are hashed by the proxy and used as DHT keys to publish the service in the DHT. The value stored for this service uniquely identifies the service, and includes the URL of a registry and the unique UDDI key of the service in that registry. Similarly when queries arrive, they are parsed and a set of search terms are identified. These search terms are hashed and the values stored with those hash values are retrieved from the DHT. Note that a proxy does not need to know all DHT nodes; it needs to know just one DHT node (this is done as part of the bootstrapping process) and as described in Section 2.3, this DHT node can route the query as necessary to the other nodes on the DHT overlay. We describe three usage scenarios later that deal with adding a new local registry, inserting a new service, and querying for a service. Furthermore, the DHT optimizes the UDDI query mechanism. This process becomes a lookup using a UDDI unique key rather than a query using a set of search parameters. This key and the URL of the registry are obtained by searching initially in the DHT. The DHT query can return multiple values for matching services, and in each of the matching registries, the proxy performs lookup operations. The service name is used as a hash for inserting the service information. The service information contains the query URL and unique UDDI key for the registry containing the service. There could be multiple registries associated with a given service. The service information conforms to the following schema. <xs:schema xmlns:xs=http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema elementFormDefault=qualified attributeFormDefault=unqualified> <xs:element name=registries> <xs:annotation> <xs:documentation>Service Information</xs:documentation> </xs:annotation> <xs:complexType> <xs:sequence> <xs:element name=registry maxOccurs=unbounded> <xs:complexType> <xs:sequence> <xs:element name=name/> <xs:element name=key maxOccurs=unbounded/> </xs:sequence> … </xs:schema> There can be multiple proxy UDDI registries in this architecture. The advantage of this is to introduce distributed interactions between the UDDI clients and registries. Organization can also decide what information is available from the local registries by implementing policies at the proxy registry. 3.1 Sequence of Operations In this section, we demonstrate what the sequence of operations should be for three crucial scenarios - adding a new local registry, inserting a new service and querying a service. Other operations like deleting a registry, deleting a service, etc. are similar and for the sake of brevity are omitted here. Figure 2: Sequence Diagram- Add New Local Registry Add a New Local UDDI Registry Figure 2 contains a sequence diagram illustrating how a new UDDI registry is added to the network of UDDI registries. The new registry registers itself with its proxy registry. The proxy registry in turn queries the new registry for all services that it has UDDI Local Registry UDDI Local Registry UDDI Local Registry Proxy Registry DHT Based Distribution Proxy Registry Proxy Registry Article 2 stored in its databases and in turn registers each of those entries with the DHT. Figure 3: Sequence Diagram - Add New Service Add a New Service The use case diagram depicted in Error! Reference source not found. highlights how a client publishes a new service to the UDDI registry. In order to interact with the registry a client has to know how to contact its local proxy registry. It then publishes a service with the proxy registry which in turn publishes the service with the local UDDI registry and receives the UDDI key of the registry entry. Then new key-value pairs are published in the DHT, where each key is obtained by hashing a searchable keyword of the service and the value consists of the query URL of the registry and the UDDI key. Figure 4: Sequence Diagram - Query for a Service Query a Service Figure 4 shows how a client queries the UDDI registry for a service. Once again, the client needs to know how to contact its local proxy registry and invokes the query service request. The proxy registry in turn contacts one of the DHT nodes to determine DHT queries using the search terms. As explained earlier in the context of Figure 1, multiple values might be retrieved from the DHT. Each value includes the query URL of a registry, and the unique UDDI key of a matching service in that registry. The proxy then contacts the matching registries and waits for the response of lookup operations using the corresponding UDDI keys. Upon receiving the responses, the proxy registry collates all responses and returns the aggregated set of services to the client. We will now illustrate these operations using an example. Consider a client contacting its local proxy to publish a service called Computer Accessories. The proxy follows the steps in Figure 3 to add the service to UDDI 1 registry, and also publishes two entries in the DHT. The keys of these entries are obtained by hashing the words computer and accessories respectively. Both entries have the same value consisting of the query URL of this registry and the unique UDDI key returned by the registry for this service. Next we consider another client publishing a service called Computer Repair through its proxy to UDDI 2 registry. A similar process results in 2 more entries being added to the DHT. Recall that our DHT deployment can have multiple entries with the same key. If we follow the steps in Figure 4 for a client sending a query to its proxy using the word computer, we see that the DHT is queried with the hash of the word computer as key. This retrieves the query URL and respective UDDI keys of both services mentioned before in this example. The proxy can then do a simple lookup operation at both UDDI 1 and 2 registries. It is clear that as the number of UDDI registries and clients increases, this process of lookup at only relevant UDDI registries is more scalable that doing a full search using the word computer at all UDDI registries. 4. IMPLEMENTATION In this section, we describe our implementation which is currently deployed on PlanetLab [9]. PlanetLab is an open, globally distributed platform for developing, deploying, and accessing network services. It currently has 527 machines, hosted by 249 sites, spanning over 25 countries. PlanetLab machines are hosted by research/academic institutions as well as industrial companies. France Telecom and HP are two of the major industry supporters for PlanetLab. Every PlanetLab host machine is connected to the Internet and runs a common software package including a Linux based operating system that supports server virtualization. Thus the users can develop and experiment with new services under real-world conditions. The advantage of using PlanetLab is that we can test the DUDE architecture under real-world conditions with a large scale geographically dispersed node base. Due to the availability of jUDDI, an open source UDDI V2 registry (http://www.juddi.org) and a lack of existing readily available UDDI V3 registry, a decision to use UDDI V2 was made. The standardization of UDDI V3 is recent and we intend to extend this work to support UDDI V3 and subsequent versions in the future. The proxy registry is implemented by modifying the jUDDI source to enable publishing, querying and deleting service information from a DHT. Furthermore, it also allows querying multiple registries and collating the response using UDDI4j [13]. For the DHT implementation, we use the Bamboo DHT code [11]. The Bamboo DHT allows multiple proxy registries to publish and delete service information from their respective UDDI registries, as well as to query for services from all the registries. The proxy uses the service name as input to the DHTs hash Article 2 function to get the DHT key. The value that is stored in the DHT using this key is the URI of the registry along with the UDDI key of the service. This ensures that when the proxy registry queries for services with a certain name, it gets back the URI and UDDI keys for matching entries. Using these returned results, the proxy can do fast lookup operations at the respective UDDI registries. The UDDI keys make it unnecessary to repeat the search at the UDDI registries with the service name. We have so far described the process of exact match on service name. However there are additional types of search that must be supported. Firstly, the search requested could be case-insensitive. To support that, the proxy registry has to publish the same service once using the name exactly as entered in the UDDI registry, and once with the name converted to all lower-case letters. To do a case-insensitive search, the proxy registry simply has to convert the query string into lower-case letters. Secondly, the user could query based on the prefix of a service name. Indeed, this is the default behavior of search in UDDI. In other words, a wildcard is implicit at the end of the service name being searched. To support this efficiently in the DHT, our proxy registries have to take prefixes of the service name of varying length and publish the URI and UDDI key multiple times, once using each prefix. For example, the prefix sizes chosen in one deployment might be 5, 10, 15 and 20 characters. If a search for the first 12 characters of a service name is submitted, the proxy registry will query the DHT with the first 10 characters of the search string, and then refine the search result to ensure that the match extends to the 12th character. If the search string has less than 5 characters, and the search is for a prefix rather than an exact match, the DHT cannot be of any help, unless every service is published in the DHT with prefix of length 0. Using this null prefix will send a copy of every advertised service to the DHT node to which the hash of the null prefix maps. Since this can lead to load-imbalance, a better solution might be to use the DHT only to get a list of all UDDI registries, and send the search to all of them in the locations to be searched. Thirdly, the service name being searched can be a regular expression, such as one with embedded wildcard characters. For example, a search for Garden%s should match both Garden Supplies and Gardening Tools. This will be treated similarly to the previous case as the DHT has to be queried with the longest available prefix. The results returned have to be refined to ensure that the regular expression matches. Figure 5 shows the network diagram for our implementation. There are two proxy UDDI and juddi registry pairs. Consider a client which contacts the UDDI proxy on grouse.hpl.hp.com. The proxy does a lookup of the DHT using the query string or a prefix. This involves contacting one of the DHT nodes, such as pli1-br3.hpl.hp.com, which serves as the gateway to the DHT for grouse.hpl.hp.com, based on the latters configuration file. The DHT node may then route the query to one of the other DHT nodes which is responsible for the DHT key that the query string maps to. The results of the DHT lookup return to pli1-br3.hpl.hp.com, which forwards them to grouse.hpl.hp.com. The results may include a few services from each of the juddi registries. So the proxy registry performs the lookup operations at both planetlab1 and planetlab2.rdfrancetelecom.com for their respective entries listed in the search results. The responses to these lookups are collated by the proxy registry and returned to the client. Figure 5 Network Diagram 5. RELATED WORK A framework for QoS-based service discovery in grids has been proposed in [18]. UDDIe, an extended UDDI registry for publishing and discovering services based on QoS parameters, is proposed in [19]. Our work is complementary since we focus on how to federate the UDDI registries and address the scalability issue with UDDI. The DUDE proxy can publish the service properties supported by UDDIe in the DHT and support range queries using techniques proposed for such queries on DHTs. Then we can deliver the scalability benefits of our current solution to both UDDI and UDDIe registries. Discovering services meeting QoS and price requirements has been studied in the context of a grid economy, so that grid schedulers can use various market models such as commodity markets and auctions. The Grid Market Directory [20] was proposed for this purpose. In [12], the authors present an ontology-based matchmaker. Resource and request descriptions are expressed in RDF Schema, a semantic markup language. Matchmaking rules are expressed in TRIPLE, a language based on Horn Logic. Although our current implementation focuses on UDDI version 2, in future we will consider semantic extensions to UDDI, WS-Discovery [16] and other Grid computing standards such as Monitoring and Discovery Service (MDS) [10]. So the simplest extension of our work could involve using the DHT to do an initial syntax-based search to identify the local registries that need to be contacted. Then the Proxy Registry can contact these registries, which do semantic matchmaking to identify their matches, which are then merged at the Proxy Registry and returned to the client. The convergence of grid and P2P computing has been explored in [5]. GridVine [2] builds a logical semantic overlay on top of a physical layer consisting of P-Grid [1], a structured overlay based on distributed search tree that uses prefix-based routing and changes the overlay paths as part of the network maintenance protocol to adapt to load in different parts of the keyspace. A federated UDDI service [4] has been built on top of the PlanetP [3] publish-subscribe system for unstructured P2P communities. The focus of this work has been on the manageability of the federated service. The UDDI service is treated as an application Article 2 service to be managed in their framework. So they do not address the issue of scalability in UDDI, and instead use simple replication. In [21], the authors describe a UDDI extension (UX) system that launches a federated query only if locally found results are not adequate. While the UX Server is positioned as an intermediary similarly to the UDDI Proxy described in our DUDE framework, it focuses more on the QoS framework and does not attempt to implement a seamless federation mechanism such as our DHT based approach. In [22] D2HT describes a discovery framework built on top of DHT. However, we have chosen to use UDDI on top of DHT. D2HT have used (Agent Management System) AMS/ (Directory Facilitator) DF on top of DHT. 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we have described a distributed architecture to support large scale discovery of web-services. Our architecture will enable organizations to maintain autonomous control over their UDDI registries and at the same time allowing clients to query multiple registries simultaneously. The clients are oblivious to the transparent proxy approach we have adopted and get richer and more complete response to their queries. Based on initial prototype testing, we believe that DUDE architecture can support effective distribution of UDDI registries thereby making UDDI more robust and also addressing its scaling issues. The paper has solved the scalability issues with UDDI but does not preclude the application of this approach to other service discovery mechanisms. An example of another service discovery mechanism that could benefit from such an approach is Globus Toolkits MDS. Furthermore, we plan to investigate other aspects of grid service discovery that extend this work. Some of these aspects include the ability to subscribe to resource/service information, the ability to maintain soft states and the ability to provide a variety of views for various different purposes. In addition, we plan to revisit the service APIs for a Grid Service Discovery solution leveraging the available solutions and specifications as well as the work presented in this paper. 7.

La estandarización de las redes basadas en los servicios web ha resultado en la necesidad de que los mecanismos de descubrimiento de servicios web escalables se implementaran en cuadrículas a pesar de que UDDI ha sido el estándar de la industria de facto para el descubrimiento de servicios web, requisitos impuestos de replicación estrecha entre los registros y la faltadel control autónomo ha obstaculizado severamente su despliegue y uso generalizado. Con el advenimiento de la cuadrícula, el problema de la escalabilidad de UDDI se convertirá en un obstáculo que evitará su despliegue en las redes. En este artículo presentamos nuestra arquitectura de descubrimiento de servicio web distribuido, llamada Dude (motor de implementación UDDI distribuido). Dude aprovecha DHT (tablas hash distribuidas) como un mecanismo de cita entre múltiples registros UDDI. Dude permite a los consumidores consultar múltiples registros, al mismo tiempo que permiten que las organizaciones tengan un control autónomo sobre sus registros.

Para copiar lo contrario, volver a publicar, publicar en servidores o redistribuir a las listas, requiere un permiso específico previo y/o una tarifa. MGC 05, 28 de noviembre al 2 de diciembre de 2005 Grenoble, Mecanismos de descubrimiento de Francia que se desplegarán en cuadrículas. Los servicios de descubrimiento de red brindan la capacidad de monitorear y descubrir recursos y servicios en cuadrículas. Proporcionan la capacidad de consultar y suscribirse a la información de recursos/servicios. Además, se pueden requerir trampas de umbral para indicar un cambio específico en las condiciones existentes. El estado de los datos debe mantenerse en un estado suave para que la información más reciente siempre esté disponible. La información recopilada debe proporcionarse a una variedad de sistemas con el fin de utilizar la red o probar información sumaria. Sin embargo, el problema fundamental es la necesidad de ser escalable para manejar grandes cantidades de datos de múltiples fuentes. La comunidad de servicios web ha abordado la necesidad de descubrimiento de servicios, antes de que se anticipara las redes, a través de un estándar de la industria llamado UDDI. Sin embargo, a pesar de que UDDI ha sido el estándar de la industria de facto para el descubrimiento de servicios web, los requisitos impuestos de reflexión estrecha entre los registros y la falta de control autónomo, entre otras cosas, ha obstaculizado severamente su despliegue y uso generalizado [7]. Con el advenimiento de la red calculando el problema de escalabilidad con UDDI se convertirá en un obstáculo que evitará su implementación en las redes. Este documento aborda el problema de escalabilidad y una forma de encontrar servicios en múltiples registros en UDDI mediante el desarrollo de una arquitectura de descubrimiento de servicios web distribuidos. La distribución de la funcionalidad UDDI se puede lograr de múltiples maneras y tal vez utilizando diferentes infraestructuras/plataformas informáticas distribuidas (por ejemplo, Corba, DCE, etc.). En este artículo exploramos cómo se puede aprovechar la tecnología de la tabla de hash distribuida (DHT) para desarrollar una arquitectura de descubrimiento de servicios web distribuidos escalables. Un DHT es un sistema distribuido de igual a igual (P2P) que forma una superposición estructurada que permite un enrutamiento más eficiente que la red subyacente. Esta elección de diseño crucial está motivada por dos factores. El primer factor motivador es la simplicidad inherente de la abstracción Put/Get que proporcionan los DHT, lo que facilita la construcción de aplicaciones rápidamente además de los DHT. Reconocemos que tener solo esta abstracción puede no ser suficiente para todas las aplicaciones distribuidas, pero para el objetivo en cuestión, funciona muy bien, ya que quedará claro más adelante. Otras plataformas de computación distribuidas/middleware, al tiempo que proporcionan más funcionalidad, tienen una sobrecarga y complejidad mucho más altas. El segundo factor motivador se deriva del hecho de que los DHT son una herramienta relativamente nueva para construir aplicaciones distribuidas y nos gustaría probar su potencial aplicándolo al problema de distribuir UDDI. En la siguiente sección, proporcionamos una breve descripción de los servicios de información de la red, UDDI y sus limitaciones, que es seguida por una visión general de los DHT en la Sección 3. La Sección 4 describe nuestra arquitectura propuesta con detalles sobre casos de uso. En la Sección 5, el artículo 2 describimos nuestra implementación actual, seguida de nuestros hallazgos en la Sección 6. La Sección 7 discute el trabajo relacionado en esta área y la Sección 8 contiene nuestros comentarios finales.2. Background 2.1 Servicio de cuadrícula Discovery Computing se basa en estándares que utilizan la tecnología de servicios web. En la arquitectura presentada en [6], la función de descubrimiento de servicios se asigna a un servicio de red especializado llamado Registro. La implementación de la versión del servicio web del servicio de monitoreo y descubrimiento (WS MDS), también conocido como el componente MDS4 de Globus Toolkit versión 4 (GT4), incluye dicho registro en forma de recursos de servicio índice y propiedades de servicio sonrecopilado e indexado por este servicio. Su función básica lo hace similar al registro UDDI. Para alcanzar la escalabilidad, los servicios de índice de diferentes contenedores de globo pueden registrarse entre sí de manera jerárquica para agregar datos. Este enfoque para alcanzar la escalabilidad funciona mejor en las organizaciones virtuales jerárquicas (VO), y expandir una búsqueda para encontrar suficiente número de coincidencias implica atravesar la jerarquía. Específicamente, este enfoque no es una buena coincidencia para los sistemas que intentan explotar la convergencia de la reducción de la red y la computación entre igual [5].2.2 UDDI Más allá de la computación de la cuadrícula, el problema del descubrimiento de servicios debe abordarse de manera más general en la comunidad de servicios web. Una vez más, la escalabilidad es una gran preocupación ya que millones de compradores que buscan servicios específicos deben encontrar todos los vendedores potenciales del servicio que puedan satisfacer sus necesidades. Aunque hay diferentes formas de hacer esto, los comités de estándares de servicios web abordan este requisito a través de una especificación llamada UDDI (descripción universal, descubrimiento e integración). Un registro UDDI permite que una empresa ingrese tres tipos de información en un registro UDDI: páginas blancas, páginas amarillas y páginas verdes. La intención de UDDIS es funcionar como un registro de servicios al igual que las páginas amarillas es un registro para las empresas. Al igual que en las páginas amarillas, las empresas se registran y sus servicios en diferentes categorías. En UDDI, las páginas blancas son una lista de las entidades comerciales. Las páginas verdes representan la información técnica que es necesaria para invocar un servicio determinado. Por lo tanto, al navegar por un registro UDDI, un desarrollador debe poder localizar un servicio y una empresa y averiguar cómo invocar el servicio. Cuando se ofreció inicialmente UDDI, proporcionó mucho potencial. Sin embargo, hoy encontramos que UDDI no se ha implementado ampliamente en Internet. De hecho, los únicos usos conocidos de UDDI son los conocidos como registros privados de UDDI dentro de los límites de las empresas. Los lectores pueden consultar [7] para obtener un artículo reciente que discute las deficiencias de UDDI y las propiedades de un registro de servicio ideal. La mejora del estándar UDDI continúa con toda su fuerza y UDDI versión 3 (V3) se aprobó recientemente como un estándar de OASIS. Sin embargo, UDDI hoy tiene problemas que no se han abordado, como la escalabilidad y la autonomía de los registros individuales. UDDI V3 proporciona un mayor soporte para entornos de múltiples regys basados en la portabilidad de las claves al permitir que las claves se vuelvan a registrar en múltiples registros, la capacidad de vincular los registros en varias topologías está habilitada de manera efectiva. Sin embargo, no se proporciona una descripción normativa de estas topologías en la especificación UDDI en este punto. Las mejoras dentro de UDDI V3 que permiten el apoyo a los entornos de múltiples regularidades son significativas y abieren la posibilidad de investigaciones adicionales sobre cómo se pueden implementar entornos multirregratrales. Un escenario de implementación recomendado propuesto por la especificación UDDI V3.0.2 es utilizar los registros comerciales de UDDI como registros raíz, y es posible habilitar esto utilizando nuestra solución.2.3 Tablas de hash distribuidas Una tabla de hash distribuida (DHT) es un sistema distribuido de igual a igual (P2P) que forma una superposición estructurada que permite un enrutamiento más eficiente que la red subyacente. Mantiene una colección de pares de valor clave en los nodos que participan en esta estructura de gráficos. Para nuestra implementación, una clave es el hash de una palabra clave desde un nombre o descripción del servicio. Habrá múltiples valores para esta clave, uno para cada servicio que contenga la palabra clave. Al igual que cualquier otra estructura de datos de tabla hash, proporciona una interfaz simple que consiste en operaciones put () y get (). Esto debe hacerse con robustez debido a la naturaleza transitoria de los nodos en los sistemas P2P. El valor almacenado en el DHT puede ser cualquier objeto o una copia o referencia a él. Las teclas DHT se obtienen de un gran espacio de identificadores. Una función hash, como MD5 o SHA-1, se aplica a un nombre de objeto para obtener su clave DHT. Los nodos en un DHT también se asignan al mismo espacio de identificadores aplicando la función hash a su identificador, como la dirección IP y el número de puerto, o la clave pública. El espacio del identificador se asigna a los nodos de manera distribuida y determinista, de modo que el enrutamiento y la búsqueda se pueden realizar de manera eficiente. Los nodos de un DHT mantienen enlaces a algunos de los otros nodos en el DHT. El patrón de estos enlaces se conoce como la geometría DHTS. Por ejemplo, en el Bamboo DHT [11], y en la masa DHT [8] en el que se basa el bambú, los nodos mantienen enlaces a los nodos vecinos y a otros nodos distantes que se encuentran en una tabla de enrutamiento. La entrada de la tabla de enrutamiento en la fila I y la columna J, denotó RI [j], es otro nodo cuyo identificador coincide con los propios dígitos primero I, y cuyo dígito (i + 1) ST es j. La tabla de enrutamiento permite un enrutamiento de superposición eficiente. El bambú, como todos los DHT, especifica los algoritmos a seguir cuando un nodo se une a la red superpuesta, o cuando un nodo falla o deja la red, la geometría debe mantenerse incluso cuando esta velocidad es alta. Para lograr un enrutamiento o búsqueda consistente, se debe enrutar una clave DHT al nodo con el identificador numéricamente más cercano. Para obtener detalles sobre cómo se construyen y mantienen las tablas de enrutamiento, se hace referencia al lector [8, 11].3. Arquitectura propuesta de jerarquías de registro UDDI basadas en DHT Como se mencionó anteriormente, proponemos construir un sistema UDDI distribuido sobre una infraestructura DHT. Esta elección está motivada principalmente por la simplicidad de la abstracción Put/Get que los DHT proporcionan, lo cual es lo suficientemente potente para la tarea en cuestión, especialmente porque planeamos validar nuestro enfoque con una implementación que se ejecuta en PlanetLab [9]. Una motivación secundaria es comprender los problemas de implementación con los sistemas basados en DHT. Se han construido varias aplicaciones como superposiciones utilizando DHT, como almacenamiento de archivos distribuidos, bases de datos, publicar sistemas de suscripción y redes de distribución de contenido. En nuestro caso, estamos construyendo una red de superposición basada en DHT de registros UDDI, donde el DHT actúa como una red de encuentro que conecta múltiples registros. En el escenario de computación de la cuadrícula, una red superpuesta de múltiples registros de UDDI parece una alternativa interesante a los registros UDDI Public Artículo 2 que actualmente mantienen Microsoft, IBM, SAP y NTT. Además, nuestro objetivo es no cambiar ninguna de las interfaces UDDI para los clientes y los editores. La Figura 1 destaca la arquitectura propuesta para el marco de registro UDDI basado en DHT. Los nodos UDDI se replican en un registro UDDI según el estándar UDDI actual. Sin embargo, cada registro local tiene un registro de representación local que media entre el registro local de UDDI y el servicio DHT. El servicio DHT es el pegamento que conecta los registros proxy juntos y facilita la búsqueda de registros. Figura 1: La información del servicio de arquitectura de tipo se puede dispersar a varios registros de UDDI para promover la escalabilidad. El Registro Proxy publica, realiza consultas y elimina la información de los registros dispersos de UDDI. Sin embargo, el alcance de las consultas se limita a registros relevantes. El DHT proporciona información sobre los registros relevantes. La idea central en la arquitectura es completar los nodos DHT con la información necesaria de los proxies que permite una búsqueda fácil y ubicua cuando se realizan consultas. Cuando se agrega un nuevo servicio a un registro, todos los términos de búsqueda potenciales son cuidados por el proxy y se usan como claves DHT para publicar el servicio en el DHT. El valor almacenado para este servicio identifica de manera única el servicio e incluye la URL de un registro y la clave UDDI única del servicio en ese registro. De manera similar, cuando llegan consultas, se analizan y se identifican un conjunto de términos de búsqueda. Estos términos de búsqueda son hash y los valores almacenados con esos valores hash se recuperan del DHT. Tenga en cuenta que un proxy no necesita conocer todos los nodos DHT;Necesita saber solo un nodo DHT (esto se hace como parte del proceso de arranque) y, como se describe en la Sección 2.3, este nodo DHT puede enrutar la consulta según sea necesario a los otros nodos en la superposición de DHT. Describimos tres escenarios de uso más adelante que se ocupan de agregar un nuevo registro local, insertar un nuevo servicio y consultar un servicio. Además, el DHT optimiza el mecanismo de consulta UDDI. Este proceso se convierte en una búsqueda utilizando una clave única UDDI en lugar de una consulta utilizando un conjunto de parámetros de búsqueda. Esta clave y la URL del registro se obtienen buscando inicialmente en el DHT. La consulta DHT puede devolver múltiples valores para los servicios de coincidencia, y en cada uno de los registros coincidentes, el proxy realiza operaciones de búsqueda. El nombre del servicio se utiliza como hash para insertar la información del servicio. La información del servicio contiene la URL de consulta y la clave UDDI única para el registro que contiene el servicio. Podría haber múltiples registros asociados con un servicio determinado. La información del servicio se ajusta al siguiente esquema.<xs: esquema xmlns: xs = http: //www.w3.org/2001/xmlschema elementFormDefault = Atribute de AtributeFormdefault = no calificado> <xs: elemento name = registrados> <xs: anotación> <xs: documentación> información de servicio <//////xs: documentación> </xs: anotación> <xs: complextype> <xs: secuence> <xs: element name = registry maxoccurs = unounded> <xs: complextype> <xs: secuence> <xs: element name = name/><xs: elemento name = key maxoccurs = Unbounded/> </xs: secuencia>… </xs: esquema> Puede haber múltiples registros proxy uddi en esta arquitectura. La ventaja de esto es introducir interacciones distribuidas entre los clientes y registros UDDI. La organización también puede decidir qué información está disponible de los registros locales mediante la implementación de políticas en el registro proxy.3.1 Secuencia de operaciones En esta sección, demostramos cuál debería ser la secuencia de operaciones para tres escenarios cruciales: agregar un nuevo registro local, insertar un nuevo servicio y consultar un servicio. Otras operaciones como eliminar un registro, eliminar un servicio, etc. son similares y se omiten aquí. Figura 2: Diagrama de secuencia: agregue un nuevo registro local Agregue un nuevo Registro UDDI local La Figura 2 contiene un diagrama de secuencia que ilustra cómo se agrega un nuevo registro UDDI a la red de registros UDDI. El nuevo registro se registra con su registro de poder. El registro de poder a su vez consulta el nuevo registro para todos los servicios que tiene el registro local de UDDI Registro UDDI Local Registro de Registro Local Registro de proxy de DHT Registro de poder de distribución basado en DHT Artistra 2 almacenado en sus bases de datos y, a su vez, registra cada una de esas entradas con el DHT el DHT el DHT el DHT el DHT.. Figura 3: Diagrama de secuencia: agregue un nuevo servicio Agregue un nuevo servicio, ¡el diagrama de casos de uso representado por error! Fuente de referencia no encontrada.Destaca cómo un cliente publica un nuevo servicio al registro UDDI. Para interactuar con el registro, un cliente debe saber cómo contactar a su registro de poder local. Luego publica un servicio con el registro de poder que a su vez publica el servicio con el registro UDDI local y recibe la clave UDDI de la entrada del registro. Luego, se publican nuevos pares de valor clave en el DHT, donde cada clave se obtiene al fabricar una palabra clave de búsqueda del servicio y el valor consiste en la URL de consulta del registro y la clave UDDI. Figura 4: Diagrama de secuencia: consulta para una consulta de servicio Un servicio La Figura 4 muestra cómo un cliente consulta el registro UDDI para un servicio. Una vez más, el cliente necesita saber cómo contactar a su registro de poder local e invoca la solicitud de servicio de consulta. El registro proxy a su vez contacta a uno de los nodos DHT para determinar las consultas DHT utilizando los términos de búsqueda. Como se explicó anteriormente en el contexto de la Figura 1, se pueden recuperar múltiples valores del DHT. Cada valor incluye la URL de consulta de un registro y la clave UDDI única de un servicio coincidente en ese registro. El proxy luego contacta los registros coincidentes y espera la respuesta de las operaciones de búsqueda utilizando las claves UDDI correspondientes. Al recibir las respuestas, el Registro Proxy recopila todas las respuestas y devuelve el conjunto agregado de servicios al cliente. Ahora ilustraremos estas operaciones usando un ejemplo. Considere un cliente que contactó a su proxy local para publicar un servicio llamado accesorios de computadora. El proxy sigue los pasos de la Figura 3 para agregar el servicio al registro UDDI 1, y también publica dos entradas en el DHT. Las claves de estas entradas se obtienen al hash las palabras computadora y accesorios, respectivamente. Ambas entradas tienen el mismo valor que consiste en la URL de consulta de este registro y la clave UDDI única devuelta por el registro para este servicio. A continuación, consideramos a otro cliente que publica un servicio llamado reparación de computadoras a través de su proxy al registro UDDI 2. Un proceso similar da como resultado 2 entradas más agregadas al DHT. Recuerde que nuestra implementación de DHT puede tener múltiples entradas con la misma clave. Si seguimos los pasos de la Figura 4 para un cliente que envía una consulta a su proxy usando la computadora de la palabra, vemos que el DHT se consulta con el hash de la computadora de la palabra como clave. Esto recupera la URL de consulta y las respectivas claves UDDI de ambos servicios mencionados anteriormente en este ejemplo. El proxy puede hacer una operación de búsqueda simple en los registros UDDI 1 y 2. Está claro que a medida que aumenta el número de registros y clientes de UDDI, este proceso de búsqueda solo en registros UDDI relevantes es más escalable que hacer una búsqueda completa utilizando la computadora Word en todos los registros UDDI.4. Implementación En esta sección, describimos nuestra implementación que actualmente se implementa en PlanetLab [9]. PlanetLab es una plataforma abierta y distribuida a nivel mundial para desarrollar, implementar y acceder a los servicios de red. Actualmente tiene 527 máquinas, alojadas por 249 sitios, que abarcan más de 25 países. Las máquinas PlanetLab están alojadas por instituciones de investigación/académicas, así como de empresas industriales. France Telecom y HP son dos de los principales partidarios de la industria para PlanetLab. Cada máquina host de PlanetLab está conectada a Internet y ejecuta un paquete de software común que incluye un sistema operativo basado en Linux que admite la virtualización del servidor. Por lo tanto, los usuarios pueden desarrollar y experimentar con nuevos servicios en condiciones del mundo real. La ventaja de usar PlanetLab es que podemos probar la arquitectura de tipo en condiciones del mundo real con una base de nodo geográficamente dispersa geográficamente a gran escala. Debido a la disponibilidad de Juddi, un registro UDDI V2 de código abierto (http://www.juddi.org) y la falta de registro UDDI V3 fácilmente disponible, se tomó una decisión de usar UDDI V2. La estandarización de UDDI V3 es reciente y tenemos la intención de extender este trabajo para apoyar UDDI V3 y versiones posteriores en el futuro. El registro de proxy se implementa modificando la fuente de Juddi para habilitar la publicación, consultar y eliminar la información del servicio de un DHT. Además, también permite consultar múltiples registros y recopilar la respuesta usando UDDI4J [13]. Para la implementación de DHT, utilizamos el código DHT de bambú [11]. El Bamboo DHT permite que múltiples registros proxy publiquen y eliminen la información del servicio de sus respectivos registros UDDI, así como consulten los servicios de todos los registros. El proxy utiliza el nombre del servicio como entrada a la función DHTS Hash Artículo 2 para obtener la tecla DHT. El valor que se almacena en el DHT usando esta clave es el URI del registro junto con la clave UDDI del servicio. Esto asegura que cuando el Registro de Proxy consulte los servicios con un nombre determinado, recupere las teclas URI y UDDI para las entradas coincidentes. Usando estos resultados devueltos, el proxy puede hacer operaciones de búsqueda rápidas en los respectivos registros UDDI. Las claves UDDI hacen innecesaria repetir la búsqueda en los registros UDDI con el nombre del servicio. Hasta ahora hemos descrito el proceso de coincidencia exacta en el nombre del servicio. Sin embargo, hay tipos adicionales de búsqueda que deben ser compatibles. En primer lugar, la búsqueda solicitada podría ser insensible al caso. Para respaldar eso, el registro de proxy tiene que publicar el mismo servicio una vez utilizando el nombre exactamente como se ingresó en el registro UDDI, y una vez con el nombre convertido a todas las letras de los casos más bajos. Para hacer una búsqueda insensible al caso, el registro de proxy simplemente tiene que convertir la cadena de consulta en letras de caso inferior. En segundo lugar, el usuario podría consultar en función del prefijo de un nombre de servicio. De hecho, este es el comportamiento predeterminado de la búsqueda en UDDI. En otras palabras, un comodín está implícito al final del nombre del servicio que se busca. Para respaldar esto de manera eficiente en el DHT, nuestros registros proxy deben tomar prefijos del nombre del servicio de una longitud variable y publicar la clave URI y UDDI varias veces, una vez que use cada prefijo. Por ejemplo, los tamaños de prefijo elegidos en una implementación pueden ser de 5, 10, 15 y 20 caracteres. Si se envía una búsqueda de los primeros 12 caracteres de un nombre de servicio, el registro de proxy consultará el DHT con los primeros 10 caracteres de la cadena de búsqueda y luego refinar el resultado de la búsqueda para garantizar que la coincidencia se extienda al 12º carácter. Si la cadena de búsqueda tiene menos de 5 caracteres, y la búsqueda es de un prefijo en lugar de una coincidencia exacta, el DHT no puede ser de ayuda, a menos que cada servicio se publique en el DHT con prefijo de longitud 0. El uso de este prefijo nulo enviará una copia de cada servicio anunciado al nodo DHT al que mapea el hash del prefijo nulo. Dado que esto puede conducir a la carga de carga, una mejor solución podría ser usar el DHT solo para obtener una lista de todos los registros UDDI y enviar la búsqueda a todos en las ubicaciones que se buscarán. En tercer lugar, el nombre del servicio que se busca puede ser una expresión regular, como una con caracteres comodines incrustados. Por ejemplo, una búsqueda de%s de jardín debería coincidir con los suministros de jardín y las herramientas de jardinería. Esto se tratará de manera similar al caso anterior, ya que el DHT debe ser consultado con el prefijo más largo disponible. Los resultados devueltos deben refinarse para garantizar que la expresión regular coincida. La Figura 5 muestra el diagrama de red para nuestra implementación. Hay dos parejas de registro UDDI y Juddi. Considere un cliente que contacta el proxy UDDI en Grouse.hpl.hp.com. El proxy realiza una búsqueda del DHT usando la cadena de consulta o un prefijo. Esto implica contactar a uno de los nodos DHT, como Pli1-Br3.hpl.hp.com, que sirve como puerta de enlace al DHT para Grouse.hpl.hp.com, en función del archivo de configuración de los últimos. El nodo DHT puede luego enrutar la consulta a uno de los otros nodos DHT que es responsable de la tecla DHT a la que se asigna la cadena de la consulta. Los resultados de la búsqueda DHT regresan a Pli1-Br3.hpl.hp.com, que los reenvía a Grouse.hpl.hp.com. Los resultados pueden incluir algunos servicios de cada uno de los registros de Juddi. Por lo tanto, el registro de proxy realiza las operaciones de búsqueda en PlanetLab1 y PlanetLab2.RDFrancetelecom.com para sus respectivas entradas enumeradas en los resultados de búsqueda. Las respuestas a estas búsquedas son recopiladas por el Registro Proxy y se devuelven al cliente. Figura 5 Diagrama de red 5. Trabajo relacionado Se ha propuesto un marco para el descubrimiento de servicios basado en Qo en cuadrículas en [18]. UDDIE, un registro de UDDI extendido para publicar y descubrir servicios basados en parámetros de QoS, se propone en [19]. Nuestro trabajo es complementario ya que nos enfocamos en cómo federar los registros de UDDI y abordar el problema de escalabilidad con UDDI. El proxy Dude puede publicar las propiedades del servicio admitidas por UDDIE en las consultas DHT y Rango de soporte utilizando técnicas propuestas para tales consultas en DHTS. Luego podemos ofrecer los beneficios de escalabilidad de nuestra solución actual a los registros UDDI y UDDIE. Descubrir los servicios que cumplen con los requisitos de QoS y precios se han estudiado en el contexto de una economía de la red, para que los programadores de redes puedan usar varios modelos de mercado, como mercados de productos básicos y subastas. El directorio de mercado de la cuadrícula [20] se propuso para este propósito. En [12], los autores presentan un emparejador basado en la ontología. Las descripciones de recursos y solicitudes se expresan en el esquema RDF, un lenguaje de marcado semántico. Las reglas de emparejamiento se expresan en Triple, un idioma basado en la lógica de la bocina. Aunque nuestra implementación actual se centra en la versión 2 de UDDI, en el futuro consideraremos extensiones semánticas a UDDI, WS-Descubrube [16] y otros estándares de computación de la cuadrícula, como el Servicio de Monitoreo y Descubrimiento (MDS) [10]. Por lo tanto, la extensión más simple de nuestro trabajo podría implicar el uso del DHT para hacer una búsqueda inicial basada en sintaxis para identificar los registros locales que deben ser contactados. Luego, el registro de proxy puede contactar a estos registros, que realizan un emparejamiento semántico para identificar sus coincidencias, que luego se fusionan en el registro de proxy y se devuelven al cliente. La convergencia de la cuadrícula y la computación P2P se ha explorado en [5]. Gridvine [2] construye una superposición semántica lógica encima de una capa física que consiste en P-Grid [1], una superposición estructurada basada en el árbol de búsqueda distribuido que utiliza el enrutamiento basado en prefijos y cambia las rutas de superposición como parte del protocolo de mantenimiento de la redpara adaptarse a la carga en diferentes partes del espacio de tecla. Se ha construido un servicio UDDI federado [4] en la parte superior del sistema Publish-Suscribe Planetp [3] para las comunidades P2P no estructuradas. El enfoque de este trabajo ha estado en la gestión del servicio federado. El servicio UDDI se trata como un servicio de Artículo 2 de la aplicación que se administrará en su marco. Por lo tanto, no abordan el problema de la escalabilidad en UDDI y, en su lugar, usan una replicación simple. En [21], los autores describen un sistema de extensión UDDI (UX) que lanza una consulta federada solo si los resultados encontrados localmente no son adecuados. Si bien el servidor UX se posiciona como un intermediario de manera similar al proxy UDDI descrito en nuestro marco de tipo, se centra más en el marco de QoS y no intenta implementar un mecanismo de federación perfecta como nuestro enfoque basado en DHT. En [22] D2HT describe un marco de descubrimiento construido sobre DHT. Sin embargo, hemos elegido usar UDDI en la parte superior de DHT. D2HT ha utilizado (sistema de gestión de agentes) AMS/ (facilitador de directorio) DF sobre DHT.6. Conclusiones y trabajo futuro En este documento, hemos descrito una arquitectura distribuida para respaldar el descubrimiento a gran escala de servicios web. Nuestra arquitectura permitirá a las organizaciones mantener un control autónomo sobre sus registros UDDI y, al mismo tiempo, permitir a los clientes consultar múltiples registros simultáneamente. Los clientes son ajenos al enfoque de poder transparente que hemos adoptado y enriqueciendo una respuesta más rica y completa a sus consultas. Según las pruebas de prototipos iniciales, creemos que la arquitectura de tipo puede soportar una distribución efectiva de los registros de UDDI, lo que hace que UDDI sea más sólido y también abordar sus problemas de escala. El documento ha resuelto los problemas de escalabilidad con UDDI, pero no impide la aplicación de este enfoque a otros mecanismos de descubrimiento de servicios. Un ejemplo de otro mecanismo de descubrimiento de servicios que podría beneficiarse de dicho enfoque es Globus Toolkits MDS. Además, planeamos investigar otros aspectos del descubrimiento de servicios de red que extienden este trabajo. Algunos de estos aspectos incluyen la capacidad de suscribirse a la información de recursos/servicios, la capacidad de mantener estados blandos y la capacidad de proporcionar una variedad de vistas para diversos fines diferentes. Además, planeamos revisar las API del servicio para una solución de descubrimiento de servicios de cuadrícula que aprovecha las soluciones y especificaciones disponibles, así como el trabajo presentado en este documento.7.

        "However, the fundamental problem is the need to be scalable to handle huge amounts of data from multiple sources.",
        "The web services community has addressed the need for service discovery, before grids were anticipated, via an industry standard called UDDI.",
        "However, even though UDDI has been the de facto industry standard for web-services discovery, imposed requirements of tight-replication among registries and lack of autonomous control, among other things has severely hindered its widespread deployment and usage [7].",

        "Distributing UDDI functionality can be achieved in multiple ways and perhaps using different distributed computing infrastructure/platforms (e.g., CORBA, DCE, etc.).",
        "In this paper we explore how Distributed Hash Table (DHT) technology can be leveraged to develop a scalable distributed web services discovery architecture.",
        "A DHT is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed system that forms a structured overlay allowing more efficient routing than the underlying network.",
        "This crucial design choice is motivated by two factors.",
        "The first motivating factor is the inherent simplicity of the put/get abstraction that DHTs provide, which makes it easy to rapidly build applications on top of DHTs.",
        "We recognize that having just this abstraction may not suffice for all distributed applications, but for the objective at hand, works very well as will become clear later.",
        "Other distributed computing platforms/middleware while providing more functionality have much higher overhead and complexity.",
        "The second motivating factor stems from the fact that DHTs are relatively new tool for building distributed applications and we would like to test its potential by applying it to the problem of distributing UDDI.",
        "In the next section, we provide a brief overview of grid information services, UDDI and its limitations, which is followed by an overview of DHTs in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 describes our proposed architecture with details on use cases.",
        "In Section 5, we Article 2 describe our current implementation, followed by our findings in Section 6.",
        "Section 7 discusses the related work in this area and Section 8 contains our concluding remarks. 2.",
        "BACKGROUND 2.1 Grid Service Discovery Grid computing is based on standards which use web services technology.",
        "In the architecture presented in [6], the service discovery function is assigned to a specialized Grid service called Registry.",
        "The implementation of the web service version of the Monitoring and Discovery Service (WS MDS), also known as the MDS4 component of the Globus Toolkit version 4 (GT4), includes such a registry in the form of the Index service Resource and service properties are collected and indexed by this service.",
        "Its basic function makes it similar to UDDI registry.",
        "To attain scalability, Index services from different Globus containers can register with each other in a hierarchical fashion to aggregate data.",
        "This approach for attaining scalability works best in hierarchical Virtual Organizations (VO), and expanding a search to find sufficient number of matches involves traversing the hierarchy.",
        "Specifically, this approach is not a good match for systems that try to exploit the convergence of grid and peer-to-peer computing [5]. 2.2 UDDI Beyond grid computing, the problem of service discovery needs to be addressed more generally in the web services community.",
        "Again, scalability is a major concern since millions of buyers looking for specific services need to find all the potential sellers of the service who can meet their needs.",
        "Although there are different ways of doing this, the web services standards committees address this requirement through a specification called UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration).",
        "A UDDI registry enables a business to enter three types of information in a UDDI registry - white pages, yellow pages and green pages.",
        "UDDIs intent is to function as a registry for services just as the yellow pages is a registry for businesses.",
        "Just like in Yellow pages, companies register themselves and their services under different categories.",
        "In UDDI, White Pages are a listing of the business entities.",
        "Green pages represent the technical information that is necessary to invoke a given service.",
        "Thus, by browsing a UDDI registry, a developer should be able to locate a service and a company and find out how to invoke the service.",
        "When UDDI was initially offered, it provided a lot of potential.",
        "However, today we find that UDDI has not been widely deployed in the Internet.",
        "In fact, the only known uses of UDDI are what are known as private UDDI registries within an enterprises boundaries.",
        "The readers can refer to [7] for a recent article that discusses the shortcomings of UDDI and the properties of an ideal service registry.",
        "Improvement of the UDDI standard is continuing in full force and UDDI version 3 (V3) was recently approved as an OASIS Standard.",
        "However, UDDI today has issues that have not been addressed, such as scalability and autonomy of individual registries.",
        "UDDI V3 provides larger support for multi-registry environments based on portability of keys By allowing keys to be re-registered in multiple registries, the ability to link registries in various topologies is effectively enabled.",
        "However, no normative description of these topologies is provided in the UDDI specification at this point.",
        "The improvements within UDDI V3 that allow support for multi-registry environments are significant and open the possibility for additional research around how multiregistry environments may be deployed.",
        "A recommended deployment scenario proposed by the UDDI V3.0.2 Specification is to use the UDDI Business Registries as root registries, and it is possible to enable this using our solution. 2.3 Distributed Hash Tables A Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed system that forms a structured overlay allowing more efficient routing than the underlying network.",
        "It maintains a collection of key-value pairs on the nodes participating in this graph structure.",
        "For our deployment, a key is the hash of a keyword from a service name or description.",
        "There will be multiple values for this key, one for each service containing the keyword.",
        "Just like any other hash table data structure, it provides a simple interface consisting of put() and get() operations.",
        "This has to be done with robustness because of the transient nature of nodes in P2P systems.",
        "The value stored in the DHT can be any object or a copy or reference to it.",
        "The DHT keys are obtained from a large identifier space.",
        "A hash function, such as MD5 or SHA-1, is applied to an object name to obtain its DHT key.",
        "Nodes in a DHT are also mapped into the same identifier space by applying the hash function to their identifier, such as IP address and port number, or public key.",
        "The identifier space is assigned to the nodes in a distributed and deterministic fashion, so that routing and lookup can be performed efficiently.",
        "The nodes of a DHT maintain links to some of the other nodes in the DHT.",
        "The pattern of these links is known as the DHTs geometry.",
        "For example, in the Bamboo DHT [11], and in the Pastry DHT [8] on which Bamboo is based, nodes maintain links to neighboring nodes and to other distant nodes found in a routing table.",
        "The routing table entry at row i and column j, denoted Ri[j], is another node whose identifier matches its own in first i digits, and whose (i + 1)st digit is j.",
        "The routing table allows efficient overlay routing.",
        "Bamboo, like all DHTs, specifies algorithms to be followed when a node joins the overlay network, or when a node fails or leaves the network The geometry must be maintained even when this rate is high.",
        "To attain consistent routing or lookup, a DHT key must be routed to the node with the numerically closest identifier.",
        "For details of how the routing tables are constructed and maintained, the reader is referred to [8, 11]. 3.",
        "PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE OF DHT BASED UDDI REGISTRY HIERARCHIES As mentioned earlier, we propose to build a distributed UDDI system on top of a DHT infrastructure.",
        "This choice is primarily motivated by the simplicity of the put/get abstraction that DHTs provide, which is powerful enough for the task at hand, especially since we plan to validate our approach with an implementation running on PlanetLab [9].",
        "A secondary motivation is to understand deployment issues with DHT based systems.",
        "Several applications have been built as overlays using DHTs, such as distributed file storage, databases, publish-subscribe systems and content distribution networks.",
        "In our case, we are building a DHT based overlay network of UDDI registries, where the DHT acts as a rendezvous network that connects multiple registries.",
        "In the grid computing scenario, an overlay network of multiple UDDI registries seems to an interesting alternative to the UDDI public Article 2 registries currently maintained by Microsoft, IBM, SAP and NTT.",
        "In addition, our aim is to not change any of the UDDI interfaces for clients as well as publishers.",
        "Figure 1 highlights the proposed architecture for the DHT based UDDI Registry framework.",
        "UDDI nodes are replicated in a UDDI registry as per the current UDDI standard.",
        "However, each local registry has a local proxy registry that mediates between the local UDDI registry and the DHT Service.",
        "The DHT service is the glue that connects the Proxy Registries together and facilitates searching across registries.",
        "Figure 1: DUDE Architecture Service information can be dispersed to several UDDI registries to promote scalability.",
        "The proxy registry publishes, performs queries and deletes information from the dispersed UDDI registries.",
        "However, the scope of the queries is limited to relevant registries.",
        "The DHT provides information about the relevant registries.",
        "The core idea in the architecture is to populate DHT nodes with the necessary information from the proxies which enables easy and ubiquitous searching when queries are made.",
        "When a new service is added to a registry, all potential search terms are hashed by the proxy and used as DHT keys to publish the service in the DHT.",
        "The value stored for this service uniquely identifies the service, and includes the URL of a registry and the unique UDDI key of the service in that registry.",
        "Similarly when queries arrive, they are parsed and a set of search terms are identified.",
        "These search terms are hashed and the values stored with those hash values are retrieved from the DHT.",
        "Note that a proxy does not need to know all DHT nodes; it needs to know just one DHT node (this is done as part of the bootstrapping process) and as described in Section 2.3, this DHT node can route the query as necessary to the other nodes on the DHT overlay.",
        "We describe three usage scenarios later that deal with adding a new local registry, inserting a new service, and querying for a service.",
        "Furthermore, the DHT optimizes the UDDI query mechanism.",
        "This process becomes a lookup using a UDDI unique key rather than a query using a set of search parameters.",
        "This key and the URL of the registry are obtained by searching initially in the DHT.",
        "The DHT query can return multiple values for matching services, and in each of the matching registries, the proxy performs lookup operations.",
        "The service name is used as a hash for inserting the service information.",
        "The service information contains the query URL and unique UDDI key for the registry containing the service.",
        "There could be multiple registries associated with a given service.",
        "The service information conforms to the following schema. <xs:schema xmlns:xs=http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema elementFormDefault=qualified attributeFormDefault=unqualified> <xs:element name=registries> <xs:annotation> <xs:documentation>Service Information</xs:documentation> </xs:annotation> <xs:complexType> <xs:sequence> <xs:element name=registry maxOccurs=unbounded> <xs:complexType> <xs:sequence> <xs:element name=name/> <xs:element name=key maxOccurs=unbounded/> </xs:sequence> … </xs:schema> There can be multiple proxy UDDI registries in this architecture.",
        "The advantage of this is to introduce distributed interactions between the UDDI clients and registries.",
        "Organization can also decide what information is available from the local registries by implementing policies at the proxy registry. 3.1 Sequence of Operations In this section, we demonstrate what the sequence of operations should be for three crucial scenarios - adding a new local registry, inserting a new service and querying a service.",
        "Other operations like deleting a registry, deleting a service, etc. are similar and for the sake of brevity are omitted here.",
        "Figure 2: Sequence Diagram- Add New Local Registry Add a New Local UDDI Registry Figure 2 contains a sequence diagram illustrating how a new UDDI registry is added to the network of UDDI registries.",
        "The new registry registers itself with its proxy registry.",
        "The proxy registry in turn queries the new registry for all services that it has UDDI Local Registry UDDI Local Registry UDDI Local Registry Proxy Registry DHT Based Distribution Proxy Registry Proxy Registry Article 2 stored in its databases and in turn registers each of those entries with the DHT.",
        "Figure 3: Sequence Diagram - Add New Service Add a New Service The use case diagram depicted in Error!",
        "Reference source not found. highlights how a client publishes a new service to the UDDI registry.",
        "In order to interact with the registry a client has to know how to contact its local proxy registry.",
        "It then publishes a service with the proxy registry which in turn publishes the service with the local UDDI registry and receives the UDDI key of the registry entry.",
        "Then new key-value pairs are published in the DHT, where each key is obtained by hashing a searchable keyword of the service and the value consists of the query URL of the registry and the UDDI key.",
        "Figure 4: Sequence Diagram - Query for a Service Query a Service Figure 4 shows how a client queries the UDDI registry for a service.",
        "Once again, the client needs to know how to contact its local proxy registry and invokes the query service request.",
        "The proxy registry in turn contacts one of the DHT nodes to determine DHT queries using the search terms.",
        "As explained earlier in the context of Figure 1, multiple values might be retrieved from the DHT.",
        "Each value includes the query URL of a registry, and the unique UDDI key of a matching service in that registry.",
        "The proxy then contacts the matching registries and waits for the response of lookup operations using the corresponding UDDI keys.",
        "Upon receiving the responses, the proxy registry collates all responses and returns the aggregated set of services to the client.",
        "We will now illustrate these operations using an example.",
        "Consider a client contacting its local proxy to publish a service called Computer Accessories.",
        "The proxy follows the steps in Figure 3 to add the service to UDDI 1 registry, and also publishes two entries in the DHT.",
        "The keys of these entries are obtained by hashing the words computer and accessories respectively.",
        "Both entries have the same value consisting of the query URL of this registry and the unique UDDI key returned by the registry for this service.",
        "Next we consider another client publishing a service called Computer Repair through its proxy to UDDI 2 registry.",
        "A similar process results in 2 more entries being added to the DHT.",
        "Recall that our DHT deployment can have multiple entries with the same key.",
        "If we follow the steps in Figure 4 for a client sending a query to its proxy using the word computer, we see that the DHT is queried with the hash of the word computer as key.",
        "This retrieves the query URL and respective UDDI keys of both services mentioned before in this example.",
        "The proxy can then do a simple lookup operation at both UDDI 1 and 2 registries.",
        "It is clear that as the number of UDDI registries and clients increases, this process of lookup at only relevant UDDI registries is more scalable that doing a full search using the word computer at all UDDI registries. 4.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION In this section, we describe our implementation which is currently deployed on PlanetLab [9].",
        "PlanetLab is an open, globally distributed platform for developing, deploying, and accessing network services.",
        "It currently has 527 machines, hosted by 249 sites, spanning over 25 countries.",
        "PlanetLab machines are hosted by research/academic institutions as well as industrial companies.",
        "France Telecom and HP are two of the major industry supporters for PlanetLab.",
        "Every PlanetLab host machine is connected to the Internet and runs a common software package including a Linux based operating system that supports server virtualization.",
        "Thus the users can develop and experiment with new services under real-world conditions.",
        "The advantage of using PlanetLab is that we can test the DUDE architecture under real-world conditions with a large scale geographically dispersed node base.",
        "Due to the availability of jUDDI, an open source UDDI V2 registry (http://www.juddi.org) and a lack of existing readily available UDDI V3 registry, a decision to use UDDI V2 was made.",
        "The standardization of UDDI V3 is recent and we intend to extend this work to support UDDI V3 and subsequent versions in the future.",
        "The proxy registry is implemented by modifying the jUDDI source to enable publishing, querying and deleting service information from a DHT.",
        "Furthermore, it also allows querying multiple registries and collating the response using UDDI4j [13].",
        "For the DHT implementation, we use the Bamboo DHT code [11].",
        "The Bamboo DHT allows multiple proxy registries to publish and delete service information from their respective UDDI registries, as well as to query for services from all the registries.",
        "The proxy uses the service name as input to the DHTs hash Article 2 function to get the DHT key.",
        "The value that is stored in the DHT using this key is the URI of the registry along with the UDDI key of the service.",
        "This ensures that when the proxy registry queries for services with a certain name, it gets back the URI and UDDI keys for matching entries.",
        "Using these returned results, the proxy can do fast lookup operations at the respective UDDI registries.",
        "The UDDI keys make it unnecessary to repeat the search at the UDDI registries with the service name.",
        "We have so far described the process of exact match on service name.",
        "However there are additional types of search that must be supported.",
        "Firstly, the search requested could be case-insensitive.",
        "To support that, the proxy registry has to publish the same service once using the name exactly as entered in the UDDI registry, and once with the name converted to all lower-case letters.",
        "To do a case-insensitive search, the proxy registry simply has to convert the query string into lower-case letters.",
        "Secondly, the user could query based on the prefix of a service name.",
        "Indeed, this is the default behavior of search in UDDI.",
        "In other words, a wildcard is implicit at the end of the service name being searched.",
        "To support this efficiently in the DHT, our proxy registries have to take prefixes of the service name of varying length and publish the URI and UDDI key multiple times, once using each prefix.",
        "For example, the prefix sizes chosen in one deployment might be 5, 10, 15 and 20 characters.",
        "If a search for the first 12 characters of a service name is submitted, the proxy registry will query the DHT with the first 10 characters of the search string, and then refine the search result to ensure that the match extends to the 12th character.",
        "If the search string has less than 5 characters, and the search is for a prefix rather than an exact match, the DHT cannot be of any help, unless every service is published in the DHT with prefix of length 0.",
        "Using this null prefix will send a copy of every advertised service to the DHT node to which the hash of the null prefix maps.",
        "Since this can lead to load-imbalance, a better solution might be to use the DHT only to get a list of all UDDI registries, and send the search to all of them in the locations to be searched.",
        "Thirdly, the service name being searched can be a regular expression, such as one with embedded wildcard characters.",
        "For example, a search for Garden%s should match both Garden Supplies and Gardening Tools.",
        "This will be treated similarly to the previous case as the DHT has to be queried with the longest available prefix.",
        "The results returned have to be refined to ensure that the regular expression matches.",
        "Figure 5 shows the network diagram for our implementation.",
        "There are two proxy UDDI and juddi registry pairs.",
        "Consider a client which contacts the UDDI proxy on grouse.hpl.hp.com.",
        "The proxy does a lookup of the DHT using the query string or a prefix.",
        "This involves contacting one of the DHT nodes, such as pli1-br3.hpl.hp.com, which serves as the gateway to the DHT for grouse.hpl.hp.com, based on the latters configuration file.",
        "The DHT node may then route the query to one of the other DHT nodes which is responsible for the DHT key that the query string maps to.",
        "The results of the DHT lookup return to pli1-br3.hpl.hp.com, which forwards them to grouse.hpl.hp.com.",
        "The results may include a few services from each of the juddi registries.",
        "So the proxy registry performs the lookup operations at both planetlab1 and planetlab2.rdfrancetelecom.com for their respective entries listed in the search results.",
        "The responses to these lookups are collated by the proxy registry and returned to the client.",
        "Figure 5 Network Diagram 5.",
        "RELATED WORK A framework for QoS-based service discovery in grids has been proposed in [18].",

                "The second motivating factor stems from the fact that DHTs are relatively new tool for building distributed applications and we would like to test its potential by applying it to the problem of distributing UDDI.",

                "In the architecture presented in [6], the service discovery function is assigned to a specialized Grid service called Registry.",
                "The implementation of the web service version of the Monitoring and Discovery Service (WS MDS), also known as the MDS4 component of the Globus Toolkit version 4 (GT4), includes such a registry in the form of the Index service Resource and service properties are collected and indexed by this service.",
                "Its basic function makes it similar to UDDI registry.",
                "To attain scalability, Index services from different Globus containers can register with each other in a hierarchical fashion to aggregate data.",
                "This approach for attaining scalability works best in hierarchical Virtual Organizations (VO), and expanding a search to find sufficient number of matches involves traversing the hierarchy.",
                "Specifically, this approach is not a good match for systems that try to exploit the convergence of grid and peer-to-peer computing [5]. 2.2 UDDI Beyond grid computing, the problem of service discovery needs to be addressed more generally in the web services community.",
                "Again, scalability is a major concern since millions of buyers looking for specific services need to find all the potential sellers of the service who can meet their needs.",
                "Although there are different ways of doing this, the web services standards committees address this requirement through a specification called UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration).",
                "A UDDI registry enables a business to enter three types of information in a UDDI registry - white pages, yellow pages and green pages.",
                "UDDIs intent is to function as a registry for services just as the yellow pages is a registry for businesses.",
                "Just like in Yellow pages, companies register themselves and their services under different categories.",
                "In UDDI, White Pages are a listing of the business entities.",
                "Green pages represent the technical information that is necessary to invoke a given service.",
                "Thus, by browsing a UDDI registry, a developer should be able to locate a service and a company and find out how to invoke the service.",
                "When UDDI was initially offered, it provided a lot of potential.",
                "However, today we find that UDDI has not been widely deployed in the Internet.",
                "In fact, the only known uses of UDDI are what are known as private UDDI registries within an enterprises boundaries.",
                "The readers can refer to [7] for a recent article that discusses the shortcomings of UDDI and the properties of an ideal service registry.",
                "Improvement of the UDDI standard is continuing in full force and UDDI version 3 (V3) was recently approved as an OASIS Standard.",
                "However, UDDI today has issues that have not been addressed, such as scalability and autonomy of individual registries.",
                "UDDI V3 provides larger support for multi-registry environments based on portability of keys By allowing keys to be re-registered in multiple registries, the ability to link registries in various topologies is effectively enabled.",
                "However, no normative description of these topologies is provided in the UDDI specification at this point.",
                "The improvements within UDDI V3 that allow support for multi-registry environments are significant and open the possibility for additional research around how multiregistry environments may be deployed.",

                "Just like any other hash table data structure, it provides a simple interface consisting of put() and get() operations.",
                "This has to be done with robustness because of the transient nature of nodes in P2P systems.",
                "The value stored in the DHT can be any object or a copy or reference to it.",

                "The identifier space is assigned to the nodes in a distributed and deterministic fashion, so that routing and lookup can be performed efficiently.",
                "The nodes of a DHT maintain links to some of the other nodes in the DHT.",
                "The pattern of these links is known as the DHTs geometry.",
                "For example, in the Bamboo DHT [11], and in the Pastry DHT [8] on which Bamboo is based, nodes maintain links to neighboring nodes and to other distant nodes found in a routing table.",
                "The routing table entry at row i and column j, denoted Ri[j], is another node whose identifier matches its own in first i digits, and whose (i + 1)st digit is j.",
                "The routing table allows efficient overlay routing.",
                "Bamboo, like all DHTs, specifies algorithms to be followed when a node joins the overlay network, or when a node fails or leaves the network The geometry must be maintained even when this rate is high.",
                "To attain consistent routing or lookup, a DHT key must be routed to the node with the numerically closest identifier.",

                "PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE OF DHT BASED UDDI REGISTRY HIERARCHIES As mentioned earlier, we propose to build a distributed UDDI system on top of a DHT infrastructure.",
                "This choice is primarily motivated by the simplicity of the put/get abstraction that DHTs provide, which is powerful enough for the task at hand, especially since we plan to validate our approach with an implementation running on PlanetLab [9].",

                "Several applications have been built as overlays using DHTs, such as distributed file storage, databases, publish-subscribe systems and content distribution networks.",
                "In our case, we are building a DHT based overlay network of UDDI registries, where the DHT acts as a rendezvous network that connects multiple registries.",
                "In the grid computing scenario, an overlay network of multiple UDDI registries seems to an interesting alternative to the UDDI public Article 2 registries currently maintained by Microsoft, IBM, SAP and NTT.",
                "In addition, our aim is to not change any of the UDDI interfaces for clients as well as publishers.",

                "UDDI nodes are replicated in a UDDI registry as per the current UDDI standard.",
                "However, each local registry has a local proxy registry that mediates between the local UDDI registry and the DHT Service.",
                "The DHT service is the glue that connects the Proxy Registries together and facilitates searching across registries.",
                "Figure 1: DUDE Architecture Service information can be dispersed to several UDDI registries to promote scalability.",
                "The proxy registry publishes, performs queries and deletes information from the dispersed UDDI registries.",
                "However, the scope of the queries is limited to relevant registries.",
                "The DHT provides information about the relevant registries.",
                "The core idea in the architecture is to populate DHT nodes with the necessary information from the proxies which enables easy and ubiquitous searching when queries are made.",
                "When a new service is added to a registry, all potential search terms are hashed by the proxy and used as DHT keys to publish the service in the DHT.",
                "The value stored for this service uniquely identifies the service, and includes the URL of a registry and the unique UDDI key of the service in that registry.",
                "Similarly when queries arrive, they are parsed and a set of search terms are identified.",
                "These search terms are hashed and the values stored with those hash values are retrieved from the DHT.",
                "Note that a proxy does not need to know all DHT nodes; it needs to know just one DHT node (this is done as part of the bootstrapping process) and as described in Section 2.3, this DHT node can route the query as necessary to the other nodes on the DHT overlay.",
                "We describe three usage scenarios later that deal with adding a new local registry, inserting a new service, and querying for a service.",
                "Furthermore, the DHT optimizes the UDDI query mechanism.",
                "This process becomes a lookup using a UDDI unique key rather than a query using a set of search parameters.",
                "This key and the URL of the registry are obtained by searching initially in the DHT.",
                "The DHT query can return multiple values for matching services, and in each of the matching registries, the proxy performs lookup operations.",
                "The service name is used as a hash for inserting the service information.",
                "The service information contains the query URL and unique UDDI key for the registry containing the service.",

                "If a search for the first 12 characters of a service name is submitted, the proxy registry will query the DHT with the first 10 characters of the search string, and then refine the search result to ensure that the match extends to the 12th character.",
                "If the search string has less than 5 characters, and the search is for a prefix rather than an exact match, the DHT cannot be of any help, unless every service is published in the DHT with prefix of length 0.",

                "Since this can lead to load-imbalance, a better solution might be to use the DHT only to get a list of all UDDI registries, and send the search to all of them in the locations to be searched.",

                "In the architecture presented in [6], the service discovery function is assigned to a specialized Grid service called Registry.",
                "The implementation of the web service version of the Monitoring and Discovery Service (WS MDS), also known as the MDS4 component of the Globus Toolkit version 4 (GT4), includes such a registry in the form of the Index service Resource and service properties are collected and indexed by this service.",
                "Its basic function makes it similar to UDDI registry.",
                "To attain scalability, Index services from different Globus containers can register with each other in a hierarchical fashion to aggregate data.",
                "This approach for attaining scalability works best in hierarchical Virtual Organizations (VO), and expanding a search to find sufficient number of matches involves traversing the hierarchy.",
                "Specifically, this approach is not a good match for systems that try to exploit the convergence of grid and peer-to-peer computing [5]. 2.2 UDDI Beyond grid computing, the problem of service discovery needs to be addressed more generally in the web services community.",
                "Again, scalability is a major concern since millions of buyers looking for specific services need to find all the potential sellers of the service who can meet their needs.",
                "Although there are different ways of doing this, the web services standards committees address this requirement through a specification called UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration).",
                "A UDDI registry enables a business to enter three types of information in a UDDI registry - white pages, yellow pages and green pages.",
                "UDDIs intent is to function as a registry for services just as the yellow pages is a registry for businesses.",
                "Just like in Yellow pages, companies register themselves and their services under different categories.",
                "In UDDI, White Pages are a listing of the business entities.",
                "Green pages represent the technical information that is necessary to invoke a given service.",
                "Thus, by browsing a UDDI registry, a developer should be able to locate a service and a company and find out how to invoke the service.",
                "When UDDI was initially offered, it provided a lot of potential.",
                "However, today we find that UDDI has not been widely deployed in the Internet.",
                "In fact, the only known uses of UDDI are what are known as private UDDI registries within an enterprises boundaries.",

                "Bamboo, like all DHTs, specifies algorithms to be followed when a node joins the overlay network, or when a node fails or leaves the network The geometry must be maintained even when this rate is high.",

                "UDDI nodes are replicated in a UDDI registry as per the current UDDI standard.",
                "However, each local registry has a local proxy registry that mediates between the local UDDI registry and the DHT Service.",
                "The DHT service is the glue that connects the Proxy Registries together and facilitates searching across registries.",
                "Figure 1: DUDE Architecture Service information can be dispersed to several UDDI registries to promote scalability.",
                "The proxy registry publishes, performs queries and deletes information from the dispersed UDDI registries.",
                "However, the scope of the queries is limited to relevant registries.",
                "The DHT provides information about the relevant registries.",
                "The core idea in the architecture is to populate DHT nodes with the necessary information from the proxies which enables easy and ubiquitous searching when queries are made.",
                "When a new service is added to a registry, all potential search terms are hashed by the proxy and used as DHT keys to publish the service in the DHT.",
                "The value stored for this service uniquely identifies the service, and includes the URL of a registry and the unique UDDI key of the service in that registry.",
                "Similarly when queries arrive, they are parsed and a set of search terms are identified.",
                "These search terms are hashed and the values stored with those hash values are retrieved from the DHT.",
                "Note that a proxy does not need to know all DHT nodes; it needs to know just one DHT node (this is done as part of the bootstrapping process) and as described in Section 2.3, this DHT node can route the query as necessary to the other nodes on the DHT overlay.",
                "We describe three usage scenarios later that deal with adding a new local registry, inserting a new service, and querying for a service.",
                "Furthermore, the DHT optimizes the UDDI query mechanism.",

                "This key and the URL of the registry are obtained by searching initially in the DHT.",
                "The DHT query can return multiple values for matching services, and in each of the matching registries, the proxy performs lookup operations.",
                "The service name is used as a hash for inserting the service information.",
                "The service information contains the query URL and unique UDDI key for the registry containing the service.",

                "For the DHT implementation, we use the Bamboo DHT code [11].",
                "The Bamboo DHT allows multiple proxy registries to publish and delete service information from their respective UDDI registries, as well as to query for services from all the registries.",
                "The proxy uses the service name as input to the DHTs hash Article 2 function to get the DHT key.",
                "The value that is stored in the DHT using this key is the URI of the registry along with the UDDI key of the service.",
                "This ensures that when the proxy registry queries for services with a certain name, it gets back the URI and UDDI keys for matching entries.",

                "Firstly, the search requested could be case-insensitive.",
                "To support that, the proxy registry has to publish the same service once using the name exactly as entered in the UDDI registry, and once with the name converted to all lower-case letters.",
                "To do a case-insensitive search, the proxy registry simply has to convert the query string into lower-case letters.",
                "Secondly, the user could query based on the prefix of a service name.",
                "Indeed, this is the default behavior of search in UDDI.",
                "In other words, a wildcard is implicit at the end of the service name being searched.",
                "To support this efficiently in the DHT, our proxy registries have to take prefixes of the service name of varying length and publish the URI and UDDI key multiple times, once using each prefix.",
                "For example, the prefix sizes chosen in one deployment might be 5, 10, 15 and 20 characters.",
                "If a search for the first 12 characters of a service name is submitted, the proxy registry will query the DHT with the first 10 characters of the search string, and then refine the search result to ensure that the match extends to the 12th character.",
                "If the search string has less than 5 characters, and the search is for a prefix rather than an exact match, the DHT cannot be of any help, unless every service is published in the DHT with prefix of length 0.",
                "Using this null prefix will send a copy of every advertised service to the DHT node to which the hash of the null prefix maps.",
                "Since this can lead to load-imbalance, a better solution might be to use the DHT only to get a list of all UDDI registries, and send the search to all of them in the locations to be searched.",
                "Thirdly, the service name being searched can be a regular expression, such as one with embedded wildcard characters.",
                "For example, a search for Garden%s should match both Garden Supplies and Gardening Tools.",
                "This will be treated similarly to the previous case as the DHT has to be queried with the longest available prefix.",

                "The clients are oblivious to the transparent proxy approach we have adopted and get richer and more complete response to their queries.",
                "Based on initial prototype testing, we believe that DUDE architecture can support effective distribution of UDDI registries thereby making UDDI more robust and also addressing its scaling issues.",
                "The paper has solved the scalability issues with UDDI but does not preclude the application of this approach to other service discovery mechanisms.",
                "An example of another service discovery mechanism that could benefit from such an approach is Globus Toolkits MDS.",
                "Furthermore, we plan to investigate other aspects of grid service discovery that extend this work.",
                "Some of these aspects include the ability to subscribe to resource/service information, the ability to maintain soft states and the ability to provide a variety of views for various different purposes.",
                "In addition, we plan to revisit the service APIs for a Grid Service Discovery solution leveraging the available solutions and specifications as well as the work presented in this paper. 7.",

                "This crucial design choice is motivated by two factors.",

                "The second motivating factor stems from the fact that DHTs are relatively new tool for building distributed applications and we would like to test its potential by applying it to the problem of distributing UDDI.",

                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Grid Service Discovery Grid computing is based on standards which use web services technology.",
                "In the architecture presented in [6], the service discovery function is assigned to a specialized Grid service called Registry.",
                "The implementation of the web service version of the Monitoring and Discovery Service (WS MDS), also known as the MDS4 component of the Globus Toolkit version 4 (GT4), includes such a registry in the form of the Index service Resource and service properties are collected and indexed by this service.",
                "Its basic function makes it similar to UDDI registry.",
                "To attain scalability, Index services from different Globus containers can register with each other in a hierarchical fashion to aggregate data.",
                "This approach for attaining scalability works best in hierarchical Virtual Organizations (VO), and expanding a search to find sufficient number of matches involves traversing the hierarchy.",
                "Specifically, this approach is not a good match for systems that try to exploit the convergence of grid and peer-to-peer computing [5]. 2.2 UDDI Beyond grid computing, the problem of service discovery needs to be addressed more generally in the web services community.",
                "Again, scalability is a major concern since millions of buyers looking for specific services need to find all the potential sellers of the service who can meet their needs.",
                "Although there are different ways of doing this, the web services standards committees address this requirement through a specification called UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration).",
                "A UDDI registry enables a business to enter three types of information in a UDDI registry - white pages, yellow pages and green pages.",
                "UDDIs intent is to function as a registry for services just as the yellow pages is a registry for businesses.",
                "Just like in Yellow pages, companies register themselves and their services under different categories.",
                "In UDDI, White Pages are a listing of the business entities.",
                "Green pages represent the technical information that is necessary to invoke a given service.",
                "Thus, by browsing a UDDI registry, a developer should be able to locate a service and a company and find out how to invoke the service.",
                "When UDDI was initially offered, it provided a lot of potential.",
                "However, today we find that UDDI has not been widely deployed in the Internet.",
                "In fact, the only known uses of UDDI are what are known as private UDDI registries within an enterprises boundaries.",
                "The readers can refer to [7] for a recent article that discusses the shortcomings of UDDI and the properties of an ideal service registry.",
                "Improvement of the UDDI standard is continuing in full force and UDDI version 3 (V3) was recently approved as an OASIS Standard.",

                "UDDI V3 provides larger support for multi-registry environments based on portability of keys By allowing keys to be re-registered in multiple registries, the ability to link registries in various topologies is effectively enabled.",
                "However, no normative description of these topologies is provided in the UDDI specification at this point.",
                "The improvements within UDDI V3 that allow support for multi-registry environments are significant and open the possibility for additional research around how multiregistry environments may be deployed.",
                "A recommended deployment scenario proposed by the UDDI V3.0.2 Specification is to use the UDDI Business Registries as root registries, and it is possible to enable this using our solution. 2.3 Distributed Hash Tables A Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed system that forms a structured overlay allowing more efficient routing than the underlying network.",
                "It maintains a collection of key-value pairs on the nodes participating in this graph structure.",
                "For our deployment, a key is the hash of a keyword from a service name or description.",
                "There will be multiple values for this key, one for each service containing the keyword.",
                "Just like any other hash table data structure, it provides a simple interface consisting of put() and get() operations.",
                "This has to be done with robustness because of the transient nature of nodes in P2P systems.",
                "The value stored in the DHT can be any object or a copy or reference to it.",
                "The DHT keys are obtained from a large identifier space.",

                "Nodes in a DHT are also mapped into the same identifier space by applying the hash function to their identifier, such as IP address and port number, or public key.",
                "The identifier space is assigned to the nodes in a distributed and deterministic fashion, so that routing and lookup can be performed efficiently.",
                "The nodes of a DHT maintain links to some of the other nodes in the DHT.",
                "The pattern of these links is known as the DHTs geometry.",
                "For example, in the Bamboo DHT [11], and in the Pastry DHT [8] on which Bamboo is based, nodes maintain links to neighboring nodes and to other distant nodes found in a routing table.",
                "The routing table entry at row i and column j, denoted Ri[j], is another node whose identifier matches its own in first i digits, and whose (i + 1)st digit is j.",
                "The routing table allows efficient overlay routing.",
                "Bamboo, like all DHTs, specifies algorithms to be followed when a node joins the overlay network, or when a node fails or leaves the network The geometry must be maintained even when this rate is high.",
                "To attain consistent routing or lookup, a DHT key must be routed to the node with the numerically closest identifier.",
                "For details of how the routing tables are constructed and maintained, the reader is referred to [8, 11]. 3.",
                "PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE OF DHT BASED UDDI REGISTRY HIERARCHIES As mentioned earlier, we propose to build a distributed UDDI system on top of a DHT infrastructure.",
                "This choice is primarily motivated by the simplicity of the put/get abstraction that DHTs provide, which is powerful enough for the task at hand, especially since we plan to validate our approach with an implementation running on PlanetLab [9].",
                "A secondary motivation is to understand deployment issues with DHT based systems.",
                "Several applications have been built as overlays using DHTs, such as distributed file storage, databases, publish-subscribe systems and content distribution networks.",
                "In our case, we are building a DHT based overlay network of UDDI registries, where the DHT acts as a rendezvous network that connects multiple registries.",
                "In the grid computing scenario, an overlay network of multiple UDDI registries seems to an interesting alternative to the UDDI public Article 2 registries currently maintained by Microsoft, IBM, SAP and NTT.",
                "In addition, our aim is to not change any of the UDDI interfaces for clients as well as publishers.",
                "Figure 1 highlights the proposed architecture for the DHT based UDDI Registry framework.",
                "UDDI nodes are replicated in a UDDI registry as per the current UDDI standard.",
                "However, each local registry has a local proxy registry that mediates between the local UDDI registry and the DHT Service.",
                "The DHT service is the glue that connects the Proxy Registries together and facilitates searching across registries.",
                "Figure 1: DUDE Architecture Service information can be dispersed to several UDDI registries to promote scalability.",
                "The proxy registry publishes, performs queries and deletes information from the dispersed UDDI registries.",
                "However, the scope of the queries is limited to relevant registries.",
                "The DHT provides information about the relevant registries.",
                "The core idea in the architecture is to populate DHT nodes with the necessary information from the proxies which enables easy and ubiquitous searching when queries are made.",
                "When a new service is added to a registry, all potential search terms are hashed by the proxy and used as DHT keys to publish the service in the DHT.",
                "The value stored for this service uniquely identifies the service, and includes the URL of a registry and the unique UDDI key of the service in that registry.",
                "Similarly when queries arrive, they are parsed and a set of search terms are identified.",
                "These search terms are hashed and the values stored with those hash values are retrieved from the DHT.",
                "Note that a proxy does not need to know all DHT nodes; it needs to know just one DHT node (this is done as part of the bootstrapping process) and as described in Section 2.3, this DHT node can route the query as necessary to the other nodes on the DHT overlay.",
                "We describe three usage scenarios later that deal with adding a new local registry, inserting a new service, and querying for a service.",
                "Furthermore, the DHT optimizes the UDDI query mechanism.",
                "This process becomes a lookup using a UDDI unique key rather than a query using a set of search parameters.",
                "This key and the URL of the registry are obtained by searching initially in the DHT.",
                "The DHT query can return multiple values for matching services, and in each of the matching registries, the proxy performs lookup operations.",
                "The service name is used as a hash for inserting the service information.",
                "The service information contains the query URL and unique UDDI key for the registry containing the service.",
                "There could be multiple registries associated with a given service.",
                "The service information conforms to the following schema. <xs:schema xmlns:xs=http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema elementFormDefault=qualified attributeFormDefault=unqualified> <xs:element name=registries> <xs:annotation> <xs:documentation>Service Information</xs:documentation> </xs:annotation> <xs:complexType> <xs:sequence> <xs:element name=registry maxOccurs=unbounded> <xs:complexType> <xs:sequence> <xs:element name=name/> <xs:element name=key maxOccurs=unbounded/> </xs:sequence> … </xs:schema> There can be multiple proxy UDDI registries in this architecture.",
                "The advantage of this is to introduce distributed interactions between the UDDI clients and registries.",
                "Organization can also decide what information is available from the local registries by implementing policies at the proxy registry. 3.1 Sequence of Operations In this section, we demonstrate what the sequence of operations should be for three crucial scenarios - adding a new local registry, inserting a new service and querying a service.",

                "We will now illustrate these operations using an example.",
                "Consider a client contacting its local proxy to publish a service called Computer Accessories.",
                "The proxy follows the steps in Figure 3 to add the service to UDDI 1 registry, and also publishes two entries in the DHT.",
                "The keys of these entries are obtained by hashing the words computer and accessories respectively.",
                "Both entries have the same value consisting of the query URL of this registry and the unique UDDI key returned by the registry for this service.",
                "Next we consider another client publishing a service called Computer Repair through its proxy to UDDI 2 registry.",
                "A similar process results in 2 more entries being added to the DHT.",
                "Recall that our DHT deployment can have multiple entries with the same key.",
                "If we follow the steps in Figure 4 for a client sending a query to its proxy using the word computer, we see that the DHT is queried with the hash of the word computer as key.",
                "This retrieves the query URL and respective UDDI keys of both services mentioned before in this example.",
                "The proxy can then do a simple lookup operation at both UDDI 1 and 2 registries.",
                "It is clear that as the number of UDDI registries and clients increases, this process of lookup at only relevant UDDI registries is more scalable that doing a full search using the word computer at all UDDI registries. 4.",
                "IMPLEMENTATION In this section, we describe our implementation which is currently deployed on PlanetLab [9].",

                "Every PlanetLab host machine is connected to the Internet and runs a common software package including a Linux based operating system that supports server virtualization.",
                "Thus the users can develop and experiment with new services under real-world conditions.",
                "The advantage of using PlanetLab is that we can test the DUDE architecture under real-world conditions with a large scale geographically dispersed node base.",
                "Due to the availability of jUDDI, an open source UDDI V2 registry (http://www.juddi.org) and a lack of existing readily available UDDI V3 registry, a decision to use UDDI V2 was made.",
                "The standardization of UDDI V3 is recent and we intend to extend this work to support UDDI V3 and subsequent versions in the future.",
                "The proxy registry is implemented by modifying the jUDDI source to enable publishing, querying and deleting service information from a DHT.",
                "Furthermore, it also allows querying multiple registries and collating the response using UDDI4j [13].",
                "For the DHT implementation, we use the <br>bamboo dht code</br> [11].",
                "The Bamboo DHT allows multiple proxy registries to publish and delete service information from their respective UDDI registries, as well as to query for services from all the registries.",
                "The proxy uses the service name as input to the DHTs hash Article 2 function to get the DHT key.",
                "The value that is stored in the DHT using this key is the URI of the registry along with the UDDI key of the service.",
                "This ensures that when the proxy registry queries for services with a certain name, it gets back the URI and UDDI keys for matching entries.",
                "Using these returned results, the proxy can do fast lookup operations at the respective UDDI registries.",
                "The UDDI keys make it unnecessary to repeat the search at the UDDI registries with the service name.",
                "We have so far described the process of exact match on service name.",
                "However there are additional types of search that must be supported.",
                "Firstly, the search requested could be case-insensitive.",
                "To support that, the proxy registry has to publish the same service once using the name exactly as entered in the UDDI registry, and once with the name converted to all lower-case letters.",
                "To do a case-insensitive search, the proxy registry simply has to convert the query string into lower-case letters.",
                "Secondly, the user could query based on the prefix of a service name.",
                "Indeed, this is the default behavior of search in UDDI.",
                "In other words, a wildcard is implicit at the end of the service name being searched.",
                "To support this efficiently in the DHT, our proxy registries have to take prefixes of the service name of varying length and publish the URI and UDDI key multiple times, once using each prefix.",
                "For example, the prefix sizes chosen in one deployment might be 5, 10, 15 and 20 characters.",
                "If a search for the first 12 characters of a service name is submitted, the proxy registry will query the DHT with the first 10 characters of the search string, and then refine the search result to ensure that the match extends to the 12th character.",
                "If the search string has less than 5 characters, and the search is for a prefix rather than an exact match, the DHT cannot be of any help, unless every service is published in the DHT with prefix of length 0.",
                "Using this null prefix will send a copy of every advertised service to the DHT node to which the hash of the null prefix maps.",
                "Since this can lead to load-imbalance, a better solution might be to use the DHT only to get a list of all UDDI registries, and send the search to all of them in the locations to be searched.",
                "Thirdly, the service name being searched can be a regular expression, such as one with embedded wildcard characters.",
                "For example, a search for Garden%s should match both Garden Supplies and Gardening Tools.",
                "This will be treated similarly to the previous case as the DHT has to be queried with the longest available prefix.",

                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Grid Service Discovery Grid computing is based on standards which use web services technology.",
                "In the architecture presented in [6], the service discovery function is assigned to a specialized Grid service called Registry.",
                "The implementation of the web service version of the Monitoring and Discovery Service (WS MDS), also known as the MDS4 component of the Globus Toolkit version 4 (GT4), includes such a registry in the form of the Index service Resource and service properties are collected and indexed by this service.",
                "Its basic function makes it similar to UDDI registry.",
                "To attain scalability, Index services from different Globus containers can register with each other in a hierarchical fashion to aggregate data.",
                "This approach for attaining scalability works best in hierarchical Virtual Organizations (VO), and expanding a search to find sufficient number of matches involves traversing the hierarchy.",
                "Specifically, this approach is not a good match for systems that try to exploit the convergence of grid and peer-to-peer computing [5]. 2.2 UDDI Beyond grid computing, the problem of service discovery needs to be addressed more generally in the web services community.",
                "Again, scalability is a major concern since millions of buyers looking for specific services need to find all the potential sellers of the service who can meet their needs.",
                "Although there are different ways of doing this, the web services standards committees address this requirement through a specification called UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration).",
                "A UDDI registry enables a business to enter three types of information in a UDDI registry - white pages, yellow pages and green pages.",
                "UDDIs intent is to function as a registry for services just as the yellow pages is a registry for businesses.",
                "Just like in Yellow pages, companies register themselves and their services under different categories.",
                "In UDDI, White Pages are a listing of the business entities.",
                "Green pages represent the technical information that is necessary to invoke a given service.",
                "Thus, by browsing a UDDI registry, a developer should be able to locate a service and a company and find out how to invoke the service.",
                "When UDDI was initially offered, it provided a lot of potential.",
                "However, today we find that UDDI has not been widely deployed in the Internet.",
                "In fact, the only known uses of UDDI are what are known as private UDDI registries within an enterprises boundaries.",
                "The readers can refer to [7] for a recent article that discusses the shortcomings of UDDI and the properties of an ideal service registry.",

                "However, no normative description of these topologies is provided in the UDDI specification at this point.",
                "The improvements within UDDI V3 that allow support for multi-registry environments are significant and open the possibility for additional research around how multiregistry environments may be deployed.",
                "A recommended deployment scenario proposed by the UDDI V3.0.2 Specification is to use the UDDI Business Registries as root registries, and it is possible to enable this using our solution. 2.3 Distributed Hash Tables A Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed system that forms a structured overlay allowing more efficient routing than the underlying network.",
                "It maintains a collection of key-value pairs on the nodes participating in this graph structure.",
                "For our deployment, a key is the hash of a keyword from a service name or description.",

                "Just like any other hash table data structure, it provides a simple interface consisting of put() and get() operations.",
                "This has to be done with robustness because of the transient nature of nodes in P2P systems.",
                "The value stored in the DHT can be any object or a copy or reference to it.",

                "The identifier space is assigned to the nodes in a distributed and deterministic fashion, so that routing and lookup can be performed efficiently.",
                "The nodes of a DHT maintain links to some of the other nodes in the DHT.",
                "The pattern of these links is known as the DHTs geometry.",
                "For example, in the Bamboo DHT [11], and in the Pastry DHT [8] on which Bamboo is based, nodes maintain links to neighboring nodes and to other distant nodes found in a routing table.",
                "The routing table entry at row i and column j, denoted Ri[j], is another node whose identifier matches its own in first i digits, and whose (i + 1)st digit is j.",
                "The routing table allows efficient overlay routing.",
                "Bamboo, like all DHTs, specifies algorithms to be followed when a node joins the overlay network, or when a node fails or leaves the network The geometry must be maintained even when this rate is high.",
                "To attain consistent routing or lookup, a DHT key must be routed to the node with the numerically closest identifier.",
                "For details of how the routing tables are constructed and maintained, the reader is referred to [8, 11]. 3.",
                "PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE OF DHT BASED UDDI REGISTRY HIERARCHIES As mentioned earlier, we propose to build a distributed UDDI system on top of a DHT infrastructure.",
                "This choice is primarily motivated by the simplicity of the put/get abstraction that DHTs provide, which is powerful enough for the task at hand, especially since we plan to validate our approach with an implementation running on PlanetLab [9].",
                "A secondary motivation is to understand deployment issues with DHT based systems.",
                "Several applications have been built as overlays using DHTs, such as distributed file storage, databases, publish-subscribe systems and content distribution networks.",
                "In our case, we are building a DHT based overlay network of UDDI registries, where the DHT acts as a rendezvous network that connects multiple registries.",
                "In the grid computing scenario, an overlay network of multiple UDDI registries seems to an interesting alternative to the UDDI public Article 2 registries currently maintained by Microsoft, IBM, SAP and NTT.",
                "In addition, our aim is to not change any of the UDDI interfaces for clients as well as publishers.",
                "Figure 1 highlights the proposed architecture for the DHT based UDDI Registry framework.",
                "UDDI nodes are replicated in a UDDI registry as per the current UDDI standard.",
                "However, each local registry has a local proxy registry that mediates between the local UDDI registry and the DHT Service.",
                "The DHT service is the glue that connects the Proxy Registries together and facilitates searching across registries.",
                "Figure 1: DUDE Architecture Service information can be dispersed to several UDDI registries to promote scalability.",
                "The proxy registry publishes, performs queries and deletes information from the dispersed UDDI registries.",
                "However, the scope of the queries is limited to relevant registries.",
                "The DHT provides information about the relevant registries.",
                "The core idea in the architecture is to populate DHT nodes with the necessary information from the proxies which enables easy and ubiquitous searching when queries are made.",
                "When a new service is added to a registry, all potential search terms are hashed by the proxy and used as DHT keys to publish the service in the DHT.",
                "The value stored for this service uniquely identifies the service, and includes the URL of a registry and the unique UDDI key of the service in that registry.",
                "Similarly when queries arrive, they are parsed and a set of search terms are identified.",
                "These search terms are hashed and the values stored with those hash values are retrieved from the DHT.",
                "Note that a proxy does not need to know all DHT nodes; it needs to know just one DHT node (this is done as part of the bootstrapping process) and as described in Section 2.3, this DHT node can route the <br>query</br> as necessary to the other nodes on the DHT overlay.",
                "We describe three usage scenarios later that deal with adding a new local registry, inserting a new service, and querying for a service.",
                "Furthermore, the DHT optimizes the UDDI <br>query</br> mechanism.",
                "This process becomes a lookup using a UDDI unique key rather than a <br>query</br> using a set of search parameters.",
                "This key and the URL of the registry are obtained by searching initially in the DHT.",
                "The DHT <br>query</br> can return multiple values for matching services, and in each of the matching registries, the proxy performs lookup operations.",
                "The service name is used as a hash for inserting the service information.",
                "The service information contains the <br>query</br> URL and unique UDDI key for the registry containing the service.",

                "It currently has 527 machines, hosted by 249 sites, spanning over 25 countries.",
                "PlanetLab machines are hosted by research/academic institutions as well as industrial companies.",
                "France Telecom and HP are two of the major industry supporters for PlanetLab.",
                "Every PlanetLab host machine is connected to the Internet and runs a common software package including a Linux based operating system that supports server virtualization.",
                "Thus the users can develop and experiment with new services under real-world conditions.",
                "The advantage of using PlanetLab is that we can test the DUDE architecture under real-world conditions with a large scale geographically dispersed node base.",
                "Due to the availability of jUDDI, an open source UDDI V2 registry (http://www.juddi.org) and a lack of existing readily available UDDI V3 registry, a decision to use UDDI V2 was made.",
                "The standardization of UDDI V3 is recent and we intend to extend this work to support UDDI V3 and subsequent versions in the future.",
                "The proxy registry is implemented by modifying the jUDDI source to enable publishing, querying and deleting service information from a DHT.",
                "Furthermore, it also allows querying multiple registries and collating the response using UDDI4j [13].",
                "For the DHT implementation, we use the Bamboo DHT code [11].",
                "The Bamboo DHT allows multiple proxy registries to publish and delete service information from their respective UDDI registries, as well as to <br>query</br> for services from all the registries.",
                "The proxy uses the service name as input to the DHTs hash Article 2 function to get the DHT key.",
                "The value that is stored in the DHT using this key is the URI of the registry along with the UDDI key of the service.",
                "This ensures that when the proxy registry queries for services with a certain name, it gets back the URI and UDDI keys for matching entries.",
                "Using these returned results, the proxy can do fast lookup operations at the respective UDDI registries.",
                "The UDDI keys make it unnecessary to repeat the search at the UDDI registries with the service name.",
                "We have so far described the process of exact match on service name.",
                "However there are additional types of search that must be supported.",
                "Firstly, the search requested could be case-insensitive.",
                "To support that, the proxy registry has to publish the same service once using the name exactly as entered in the UDDI registry, and once with the name converted to all lower-case letters.",
                "To do a case-insensitive search, the proxy registry simply has to convert the <br>query</br> string into lower-case letters.",
                "Secondly, the user could <br>query</br> based on the prefix of a service name.",
                "Indeed, this is the default behavior of search in UDDI.",
                "In other words, a wildcard is implicit at the end of the service name being searched.",
                "To support this efficiently in the DHT, our proxy registries have to take prefixes of the service name of varying length and publish the URI and UDDI key multiple times, once using each prefix.",
                "For example, the prefix sizes chosen in one deployment might be 5, 10, 15 and 20 characters.",
                "If a search for the first 12 characters of a service name is submitted, the proxy registry will <br>query</br> the DHT with the first 10 characters of the search string, and then refine the search result to ensure that the match extends to the 12th character.",
                "If the search string has less than 5 characters, and the search is for a prefix rather than an exact match, the DHT cannot be of any help, unless every service is published in the DHT with prefix of length 0.",
                "Using this null prefix will send a copy of every advertised service to the DHT node to which the hash of the null prefix maps.",
                "Since this can lead to load-imbalance, a better solution might be to use the DHT only to get a list of all UDDI registries, and send the search to all of them in the locations to be searched.",
                "Thirdly, the service name being searched can be a regular expression, such as one with embedded wildcard characters.",
                "For example, a search for Garden%s should match both Garden Supplies and Gardening Tools.",
                "This will be treated similarly to the previous case as the DHT has to be queried with the longest available prefix.",
                "The results returned have to be refined to ensure that the regular expression matches.",
                "Figure 5 shows the network diagram for our implementation.",
                "There are two proxy UDDI and juddi registry pairs.",
                "Consider a client which contacts the UDDI proxy on grouse.hpl.hp.com.",
                "The proxy does a lookup of the DHT using the <br>query</br> string or a prefix.",
                "This involves contacting one of the DHT nodes, such as pli1-br3.hpl.hp.com, which serves as the gateway to the DHT for grouse.hpl.hp.com, based on the latters configuration file.",
                "The DHT node may then route the <br>query</br> to one of the other DHT nodes which is responsible for the DHT key that the <br>query</br> string maps to.",
                "The results of the DHT lookup return to pli1-br3.hpl.hp.com, which forwards them to grouse.hpl.hp.com.",
                "The results may include a few services from each of the juddi registries.",
                "So the proxy registry performs the lookup operations at both planetlab1 and planetlab2.rdfrancetelecom.com for their respective entries listed in the search results.",
                "The responses to these lookups are collated by the proxy registry and returned to the client.",

                "So the simplest extension of our work could involve using the DHT to do an initial syntax-based search to identify the local registries that need to be contacted.",
                "Then the Proxy Registry can contact these registries, which do semantic matchmaking to identify their matches, which are then merged at the Proxy Registry and returned to the client.",

                "While the UX Server is positioned as an intermediary similarly to the UDDI Proxy described in our DUDE framework, it focuses more on the QoS framework and does not attempt to implement a seamless federation mechanism such as our DHT based approach.",

                "The clients are oblivious to the transparent proxy approach we have adopted and get richer and more complete response to their queries.",

                "In the architecture presented in [6], the service discovery function is assigned to a specialized Grid service called Registry.",
                "The implementation of the web service version of the Monitoring and Discovery Service (WS MDS), also known as the MDS4 component of the Globus Toolkit version 4 (GT4), includes such a registry in the form of the Index service Resource and service properties are collected and indexed by this service.",
                "Its basic function makes it similar to UDDI registry.",
                "To attain scalability, Index services from different Globus containers can register with each other in a hierarchical fashion to aggregate data.",
                "This approach for attaining scalability works best in hierarchical Virtual Organizations (VO), and expanding a search to find sufficient number of matches involves traversing the hierarchy.",
                "Specifically, this approach is not a good match for systems that try to exploit the convergence of grid and peer-to-peer computing [5]. 2.2 UDDI Beyond grid computing, the problem of service discovery needs to be addressed more generally in the web services community.",
                "Again, scalability is a major concern since millions of buyers looking for specific services need to find all the potential sellers of the service who can meet their needs.",
                "Although there are different ways of doing this, the web services standards committees address this requirement through a specification called UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration).",
                "A UDDI registry enables a business to enter three types of information in a UDDI registry - white pages, yellow pages and green pages.",
                "UDDIs intent is to function as a registry for services just as the yellow pages is a registry for businesses.",

                "In UDDI, White Pages are a listing of the business entities.",
                "Green pages represent the technical information that is necessary to invoke a given service.",
                "Thus, by browsing a UDDI registry, a developer should be able to locate a service and a company and find out how to invoke the service.",
                "When UDDI was initially offered, it provided a lot of potential.",
                "However, today we find that UDDI has not been widely deployed in the Internet.",
                "In fact, the only known uses of UDDI are what are known as private UDDI registries within an enterprises boundaries.",

                "Bamboo, like all DHTs, specifies algorithms to be followed when a node joins the overlay network, or when a node fails or leaves the network The geometry must be maintained even when this rate is high.",

                "UDDI nodes are replicated in a UDDI registry as per the current UDDI standard.",
                "However, each local registry has a local proxy registry that mediates between the local UDDI registry and the DHT Service.",
                "The DHT service is the glue that connects the Proxy Registries together and facilitates searching across registries.",
                "Figure 1: DUDE Architecture Service information can be dispersed to several UDDI registries to promote scalability.",
                "The proxy registry publishes, performs queries and deletes information from the dispersed UDDI registries.",
                "However, the scope of the queries is limited to relevant registries.",
                "The DHT provides information about the relevant registries.",
                "The core idea in the architecture is to populate DHT nodes with the necessary information from the proxies which enables easy and ubiquitous searching when queries are made.",
                "When a new service is added to a registry, all potential search terms are hashed by the proxy and used as DHT keys to publish the service in the DHT.",
                "The value stored for this service uniquely identifies the service, and includes the URL of a registry and the unique UDDI key of the service in that registry.",

                "These search terms are hashed and the values stored with those hash values are retrieved from the DHT.",
                "Note that a proxy does not need to know all DHT nodes; it needs to know just one DHT node (this is done as part of the bootstrapping process) and as described in Section 2.3, this DHT node can route the query as necessary to the other nodes on the DHT overlay.",
                "We describe three usage scenarios later that deal with adding a new local registry, inserting a new service, and querying for a service.",
                "Furthermore, the DHT optimizes the UDDI query mechanism.",

                "Consider a client contacting its local proxy to publish a service called Computer Accessories.",
                "The proxy follows the steps in Figure 3 to add the service to UDDI 1 registry, and also publishes two entries in the DHT.",
                "The keys of these entries are obtained by hashing the words computer and accessories respectively.",
                "Both entries have the same value consisting of the query URL of this registry and the unique UDDI key returned by the registry for this service.",
                "Next we consider another client publishing a service called Computer Repair through its proxy to UDDI 2 registry.",
                "A similar process results in 2 more entries being added to the DHT.",
                "Recall that our DHT deployment can have multiple entries with the same key.",
                "If we follow the steps in Figure 4 for a client sending a query to its proxy using the word computer, we see that the DHT is queried with the hash of the word computer as key.",
                "This retrieves the query URL and respective UDDI keys of both services mentioned before in this example.",
                "The proxy can then do a simple lookup operation at both UDDI 1 and 2 registries.",
                "It is clear that as the number of UDDI registries and clients increases, this process of lookup at only relevant UDDI registries is more scalable that doing a full search using the word computer at all UDDI registries. 4.",
                "IMPLEMENTATION In this section, we describe our implementation which is currently deployed on PlanetLab [9].",
                "PlanetLab is an open, globally distributed platform for developing, deploying, and accessing network services.",

                "Every PlanetLab host machine is connected to the Internet and runs a common software package including a Linux based operating system that supports server virtualization.",
                "Thus the users can develop and experiment with new services under real-world conditions.",
                "The advantage of using PlanetLab is that we can test the DUDE architecture under real-world conditions with a large scale geographically dispersed node base.",
                "Due to the availability of jUDDI, an open source UDDI V2 registry (http://www.juddi.org) and a lack of existing readily available UDDI V3 registry, a decision to use UDDI V2 was made.",
                "The standardization of UDDI V3 is recent and we intend to extend this work to support UDDI V3 and subsequent versions in the future.",
                "The proxy registry is implemented by modifying the jUDDI source to enable publishing, querying and deleting service information from a DHT.",
                "Furthermore, it also allows querying multiple registries and collating the response using UDDI4j [13].",
                "For the DHT implementation, we use the Bamboo DHT code [11].",
                "The Bamboo DHT allows multiple proxy registries to publish and delete service information from their respective UDDI registries, as well as to query for services from all the registries.",
                "The proxy uses the service name as input to the DHTs hash Article 2 function to get the DHT key.",
                "The value that is stored in the DHT using this key is the URI of the registry along with the UDDI key of the service.",
                "This ensures that when the proxy registry queries for services with a certain name, it gets back the URI and UDDI keys for matching entries.",
                "Using these returned results, the proxy can do fast lookup operations at the respective UDDI registries.",
                "The UDDI keys make it unnecessary to repeat the search at the UDDI registries with the service name.",
                "We have so far described the process of exact match on service name.",
                "However there are additional types of search that must be supported.",
                "Firstly, the search requested could be case-insensitive.",
                "To support that, the proxy registry has to publish the same service once using the name exactly as entered in the UDDI registry, and once with the name converted to all lower-case letters.",
                "To do a case-insensitive search, the proxy registry simply has to convert the query string into lower-case letters.",
                "Secondly, the user could query based on the prefix of a service name.",
                "Indeed, this is the default behavior of search in UDDI.",
                "In other words, a wildcard is implicit at the end of the service name being searched.",
                "To support this efficiently in the DHT, our proxy registries have to take prefixes of the service name of varying length and publish the URI and UDDI key multiple times, once using each prefix.",
                "For example, the prefix sizes chosen in one deployment might be 5, 10, 15 and 20 characters.",
                "If a search for the first 12 characters of a service name is submitted, the proxy registry will query the DHT with the first 10 characters of the search string, and then refine the search result to ensure that the match extends to the 12th character.",
                "If the search string has less than 5 characters, and the search is for a prefix rather than an exact match, the DHT cannot be of any help, unless every service is published in the DHT with prefix of length 0.",
                "Using this null prefix will send a copy of every advertised service to the DHT node to which the hash of the null prefix maps.",
                "Since this can lead to load-imbalance, a better solution might be to use the DHT only to get a list of all UDDI registries, and send the search to all of them in the locations to be searched.",
                "Thirdly, the service name being searched can be a regular expression, such as one with embedded wildcard characters.",
                "For example, a search for Garden%s should match both Garden Supplies and Gardening Tools.",
                "This will be treated similarly to the previous case as the DHT has to be queried with the longest available prefix.",

                "The proxy does a lookup of the DHT using the query string or a prefix.",
                "This involves contacting one of the DHT nodes, such as pli1-br3.hpl.hp.com, which serves as the gateway to the DHT for grouse.hpl.hp.com, based on the latters configuration file.",

                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Grid Service Discovery Grid computing is based on standards which use web services technology.",
                "In the architecture presented in [6], the service discovery function is assigned to a specialized Grid service called Registry.",
                "The implementation of the web service version of the Monitoring and Discovery Service (WS MDS), also known as the MDS4 component of the Globus Toolkit version 4 (GT4), includes such a registry in the form of the Index service Resource and service properties are collected and indexed by this service.",
                "Its basic function makes it similar to <br>uddi registry</br>.",
                "To attain scalability, Index services from different Globus containers can register with each other in a hierarchical fashion to aggregate data.",
                "This approach for attaining scalability works best in hierarchical Virtual Organizations (VO), and expanding a search to find sufficient number of matches involves traversing the hierarchy.",
                "Specifically, this approach is not a good match for systems that try to exploit the convergence of grid and peer-to-peer computing [5]. 2.2 UDDI Beyond grid computing, the problem of service discovery needs to be addressed more generally in the web services community.",
                "Again, scalability is a major concern since millions of buyers looking for specific services need to find all the potential sellers of the service who can meet their needs.",
                "Although there are different ways of doing this, the web services standards committees address this requirement through a specification called UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration).",
                "A <br>uddi registry</br> enables a business to enter three types of information in a <br>uddi registry</br> - white pages, yellow pages and green pages.",
                "UDDIs intent is to function as a registry for services just as the yellow pages is a registry for businesses.",
                "Just like in Yellow pages, companies register themselves and their services under different categories.",
                "In UDDI, White Pages are a listing of the business entities.",
                "Green pages represent the technical information that is necessary to invoke a given service.",
                "Thus, by browsing a <br>uddi registry</br>, a developer should be able to locate a service and a company and find out how to invoke the service.",
                "When UDDI was initially offered, it provided a lot of potential.",
                "However, today we find that UDDI has not been widely deployed in the Internet.",
                "In fact, the only known uses of UDDI are what are known as private UDDI registries within an enterprises boundaries.",
                "The readers can refer to [7] for a recent article that discusses the shortcomings of UDDI and the properties of an ideal service registry.",
                "Improvement of the UDDI standard is continuing in full force and UDDI version 3 (V3) was recently approved as an OASIS Standard.",
                "However, UDDI today has issues that have not been addressed, such as scalability and autonomy of individual registries.",
                "UDDI V3 provides larger support for multi-registry environments based on portability of keys By allowing keys to be re-registered in multiple registries, the ability to link registries in various topologies is effectively enabled.",
                "However, no normative description of these topologies is provided in the UDDI specification at this point.",
                "The improvements within UDDI V3 that allow support for multi-registry environments are significant and open the possibility for additional research around how multiregistry environments may be deployed.",
                "A recommended deployment scenario proposed by the UDDI V3.0.2 Specification is to use the UDDI Business Registries as root registries, and it is possible to enable this using our solution. 2.3 Distributed Hash Tables A Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed system that forms a structured overlay allowing more efficient routing than the underlying network.",
                "It maintains a collection of key-value pairs on the nodes participating in this graph structure.",
                "For our deployment, a key is the hash of a keyword from a service name or description.",
                "There will be multiple values for this key, one for each service containing the keyword.",
                "Just like any other hash table data structure, it provides a simple interface consisting of put() and get() operations.",
                "This has to be done with robustness because of the transient nature of nodes in P2P systems.",
                "The value stored in the DHT can be any object or a copy or reference to it.",
                "The DHT keys are obtained from a large identifier space.",
                "A hash function, such as MD5 or SHA-1, is applied to an object name to obtain its DHT key.",

                "The identifier space is assigned to the nodes in a distributed and deterministic fashion, so that routing and lookup can be performed efficiently.",
                "The nodes of a DHT maintain links to some of the other nodes in the DHT.",
                "The pattern of these links is known as the DHTs geometry.",
                "For example, in the Bamboo DHT [11], and in the Pastry DHT [8] on which Bamboo is based, nodes maintain links to neighboring nodes and to other distant nodes found in a routing table.",
                "The routing table entry at row i and column j, denoted Ri[j], is another node whose identifier matches its own in first i digits, and whose (i + 1)st digit is j.",
                "The routing table allows efficient overlay routing.",
                "Bamboo, like all DHTs, specifies algorithms to be followed when a node joins the overlay network, or when a node fails or leaves the network The geometry must be maintained even when this rate is high.",
                "To attain consistent routing or lookup, a DHT key must be routed to the node with the numerically closest identifier.",
                "For details of how the routing tables are constructed and maintained, the reader is referred to [8, 11]. 3.",
                "PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE OF DHT BASED <br>uddi registry</br> HIERARCHIES As mentioned earlier, we propose to build a distributed UDDI system on top of a DHT infrastructure.",
                "This choice is primarily motivated by the simplicity of the put/get abstraction that DHTs provide, which is powerful enough for the task at hand, especially since we plan to validate our approach with an implementation running on PlanetLab [9].",
                "A secondary motivation is to understand deployment issues with DHT based systems.",
                "Several applications have been built as overlays using DHTs, such as distributed file storage, databases, publish-subscribe systems and content distribution networks.",
                "In our case, we are building a DHT based overlay network of UDDI registries, where the DHT acts as a rendezvous network that connects multiple registries.",
                "In the grid computing scenario, an overlay network of multiple UDDI registries seems to an interesting alternative to the UDDI public Article 2 registries currently maintained by Microsoft, IBM, SAP and NTT.",
                "In addition, our aim is to not change any of the UDDI interfaces for clients as well as publishers.",
                "Figure 1 highlights the proposed architecture for the DHT based <br>uddi registry</br> framework.",
                "UDDI nodes are replicated in a <br>uddi registry</br> as per the current UDDI standard.",
                "However, each local registry has a local proxy registry that mediates between the local <br>uddi registry</br> and the DHT Service.",
                "The DHT service is the glue that connects the Proxy Registries together and facilitates searching across registries.",
                "Figure 1: DUDE Architecture Service information can be dispersed to several UDDI registries to promote scalability.",
                "The proxy registry publishes, performs queries and deletes information from the dispersed UDDI registries.",
                "However, the scope of the queries is limited to relevant registries.",
                "The DHT provides information about the relevant registries.",
                "The core idea in the architecture is to populate DHT nodes with the necessary information from the proxies which enables easy and ubiquitous searching when queries are made.",
                "When a new service is added to a registry, all potential search terms are hashed by the proxy and used as DHT keys to publish the service in the DHT.",
                "The value stored for this service uniquely identifies the service, and includes the URL of a registry and the unique UDDI key of the service in that registry.",
                "Similarly when queries arrive, they are parsed and a set of search terms are identified.",
                "These search terms are hashed and the values stored with those hash values are retrieved from the DHT.",
                "Note that a proxy does not need to know all DHT nodes; it needs to know just one DHT node (this is done as part of the bootstrapping process) and as described in Section 2.3, this DHT node can route the query as necessary to the other nodes on the DHT overlay.",
                "We describe three usage scenarios later that deal with adding a new local registry, inserting a new service, and querying for a service.",
                "Furthermore, the DHT optimizes the UDDI query mechanism.",
                "This process becomes a lookup using a UDDI unique key rather than a query using a set of search parameters.",
                "This key and the URL of the registry are obtained by searching initially in the DHT.",
                "The DHT query can return multiple values for matching services, and in each of the matching registries, the proxy performs lookup operations.",
                "The service name is used as a hash for inserting the service information.",
                "The service information contains the query URL and unique UDDI key for the registry containing the service.",
                "There could be multiple registries associated with a given service.",

                "If we follow the steps in Figure 4 for a client sending a query to its proxy using the word computer, we see that the DHT is queried with the hash of the word computer as key.",
                "This retrieves the query URL and respective UDDI keys of both services mentioned before in this example.",
                "The proxy can then do a simple lookup operation at both UDDI 1 and 2 registries.",

                "Every PlanetLab host machine is connected to the Internet and runs a common software package including a Linux based operating system that supports server virtualization.",
                "Thus the users can develop and experiment with new services under real-world conditions.",
                "The advantage of using PlanetLab is that we can test the DUDE architecture under real-world conditions with a large scale geographically dispersed node base.",
                "Due to the availability of jUDDI, an open source UDDI V2 registry (http://www.juddi.org) and a lack of existing readily available UDDI V3 registry, a decision to use UDDI V2 was made.",
                "The standardization of UDDI V3 is recent and we intend to extend this work to support UDDI V3 and subsequent versions in the future.",
                "The proxy registry is implemented by modifying the jUDDI source to enable publishing, querying and deleting service information from a DHT.",
                "Furthermore, it also allows querying multiple registries and collating the response using UDDI4j [13].",
                "For the DHT implementation, we use the Bamboo DHT code [11].",
                "The Bamboo DHT allows multiple proxy registries to publish and delete service information from their respective UDDI registries, as well as to query for services from all the registries.",
                "The proxy uses the service name as input to the DHTs hash Article 2 function to get the DHT key.",
                "The value that is stored in the DHT using this key is the URI of the registry along with the UDDI key of the service.",
                "This ensures that when the proxy registry queries for services with a certain name, it gets back the URI and UDDI keys for matching entries.",
                "Using these returned results, the proxy can do fast lookup operations at the respective UDDI registries.",
                "The UDDI keys make it unnecessary to repeat the search at the UDDI registries with the service name.",
                "We have so far described the process of exact match on service name.",
                "However there are additional types of search that must be supported.",
                "Firstly, the search requested could be case-insensitive.",
                "To support that, the proxy registry has to publish the same service once using the name exactly as entered in the <br>uddi registry</br>, and once with the name converted to all lower-case letters.",
                "To do a case-insensitive search, the proxy registry simply has to convert the query string into lower-case letters.",
                "Secondly, the user could query based on the prefix of a service name.",
                "Indeed, this is the default behavior of search in UDDI.",
                "In other words, a wildcard is implicit at the end of the service name being searched.",
                "To support this efficiently in the DHT, our proxy registries have to take prefixes of the service name of varying length and publish the URI and UDDI key multiple times, once using each prefix.",
                "For example, the prefix sizes chosen in one deployment might be 5, 10, 15 and 20 characters.",
                "If a search for the first 12 characters of a service name is submitted, the proxy registry will query the DHT with the first 10 characters of the search string, and then refine the search result to ensure that the match extends to the 12th character.",
                "If the search string has less than 5 characters, and the search is for a prefix rather than an exact match, the DHT cannot be of any help, unless every service is published in the DHT with prefix of length 0.",
                "Using this null prefix will send a copy of every advertised service to the DHT node to which the hash of the null prefix maps.",
                "Since this can lead to load-imbalance, a better solution might be to use the DHT only to get a list of all UDDI registries, and send the search to all of them in the locations to be searched.",
                "Thirdly, the service name being searched can be a regular expression, such as one with embedded wildcard characters.",
                "For example, a search for Garden%s should match both Garden Supplies and Gardening Tools.",
                "This will be treated similarly to the previous case as the DHT has to be queried with the longest available prefix.",

                "This approach for attaining scalability works best in hierarchical Virtual Organizations (VO), and expanding a search to find sufficient number of matches involves traversing the hierarchy.",
                "Specifically, this approach is not a good match for systems that try to exploit the convergence of grid and peer-to-peer computing [5]. 2.2 UDDI Beyond grid computing, the problem of service discovery needs to be addressed more generally in the web services community.",
                "Again, scalability is a major concern since millions of buyers looking for specific services need to find all the potential sellers of the service who can meet their needs.",

                "If a search for the first 12 characters of a service name is submitted, the proxy registry will query the DHT with the first 10 characters of the search string, and then refine the search result to ensure that the match extends to the 12th character.",
                "If the search string has less than 5 characters, and the search is for a prefix rather than an exact match, the DHT cannot be of any help, unless every service is published in the DHT with prefix of length 0.",
                "Using this null prefix will send a copy of every advertised service to the DHT node to which the hash of the null prefix maps.",
                "Since this can lead to load-imbalance, a better solution might be to use the DHT only to get a list of all UDDI registries, and send the search to all of them in the locations to be searched.",

                "In the architecture presented in [6], the service discovery function is assigned to a specialized Grid service called Registry.",
                "The implementation of the web service version of the Monitoring and Discovery Service (WS MDS), also known as the MDS4 component of the Globus Toolkit version 4 (GT4), includes such a registry in the form of the Index service Resource and service properties are collected and indexed by this service.",
                "Its basic function makes it similar to UDDI registry.",
                "To attain scalability, Index services from different Globus containers can register with each other in a hierarchical fashion to aggregate data.",
                "This approach for attaining scalability works best in hierarchical Virtual Organizations (VO), and expanding a search to find sufficient number of matches involves traversing the hierarchy.",
                "Specifically, this approach is not a good match for systems that try to exploit the convergence of grid and peer-to-peer computing [5]. 2.2 UDDI Beyond grid computing, the problem of service discovery needs to be addressed more generally in the web services community.",
                "Again, scalability is a major concern since millions of buyers looking for specific services need to find all the potential sellers of the service who can meet their needs.",
                "Although there are different ways of doing this, the web services standards committees address this requirement through a specification called UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration).",
                "A UDDI registry enables a business to enter three types of information in a UDDI registry - white pages, yellow pages and green pages.",
                "UDDIs intent is to function as a registry for services just as the yellow pages is a registry for businesses.",
                "Just like in Yellow pages, companies register themselves and their services under different categories.",
                "In UDDI, White Pages are a listing of the business entities.",
                "Green pages represent the technical information that is necessary to invoke a given service.",
                "Thus, by browsing a UDDI registry, a developer should be able to locate a service and a company and find out how to invoke the service.",
                "When UDDI was initially offered, it provided a lot of potential.",
                "However, today we find that UDDI has not been widely deployed in the Internet.",
                "In fact, the only known uses of UDDI are what are known as private UDDI registries within an enterprises boundaries.",

                "The routing table entry at row i and column j, denoted Ri[j], is another node whose identifier matches its own in first i digits, and whose (i + 1)st digit is j.",
                "The routing table allows efficient overlay routing.",
                "Bamboo, like all DHTs, specifies algorithms to be followed when a node joins the overlay network, or when a node fails or leaves the network The geometry must be maintained even when this rate is high.",

                "UDDI nodes are replicated in a UDDI registry as per the current UDDI standard.",
                "However, each local registry has a local proxy registry that mediates between the local UDDI registry and the DHT Service.",
                "The DHT service is the glue that connects the Proxy Registries together and facilitates searching across registries.",
                "Figure 1: DUDE Architecture Service information can be dispersed to several UDDI registries to promote scalability.",
                "The proxy registry publishes, performs queries and deletes information from the dispersed UDDI registries.",
                "However, the scope of the queries is limited to relevant registries.",
                "The DHT provides information about the relevant registries.",
                "The core idea in the architecture is to populate DHT nodes with the necessary information from the proxies which enables easy and ubiquitous searching when queries are made.",
                "When a new service is added to a registry, all potential search terms are hashed by the proxy and used as DHT keys to publish the service in the DHT.",
                "The value stored for this service uniquely identifies the service, and includes the URL of a registry and the unique UDDI key of the service in that registry.",
                "Similarly when queries arrive, they are parsed and a set of search terms are identified.",
                "These search terms are hashed and the values stored with those hash values are retrieved from the DHT.",
                "Note that a proxy does not need to know all DHT nodes; it needs to know just one DHT node (this is done as part of the bootstrapping process) and as described in Section 2.3, this DHT node can route the query as necessary to the other nodes on the DHT overlay.",
                "We describe three usage scenarios later that deal with adding a new local registry, inserting a new service, and querying for a service.",
                "Furthermore, the DHT optimizes the UDDI query mechanism.",

                "This key and the URL of the registry are obtained by searching initially in the DHT.",
                "The DHT query can return multiple values for matching services, and in each of the matching registries, the proxy performs lookup operations.",
                "The service name is used as a hash for inserting the service information.",

                "Both entries have the same value consisting of the query URL of this registry and the unique UDDI key returned by the registry for this service.",
                "Next we consider another client publishing a service called Computer Repair through its proxy to UDDI 2 registry.",
                "A similar process results in 2 more entries being added to the DHT.",

                "If we follow the steps in Figure 4 for a client sending a query to its proxy using the word computer, we see that the DHT is queried with the hash of the word computer as key.",

                "Thus the users can develop and experiment with new services under real-world conditions.",
                "The advantage of using PlanetLab is that we can test the DUDE architecture under real-world conditions with a large scale geographically dispersed node base.",
                "Due to the availability of jUDDI, an open source UDDI V2 registry (http://www.juddi.org) and a lack of existing readily available UDDI V3 registry, a decision to use UDDI V2 was made.",
                "The standardization of UDDI V3 is recent and we intend to extend this work to support UDDI V3 and subsequent versions in the future.",
                "The proxy registry is implemented by modifying the jUDDI source to enable publishing, querying and deleting service information from a DHT.",
                "Furthermore, it also allows querying multiple registries and collating the response using UDDI4j [13].",
                "For the DHT implementation, we use the Bamboo DHT code [11].",
                "The Bamboo DHT allows multiple proxy registries to publish and delete service information from their respective UDDI registries, as well as to query for services from all the registries.",
                "The proxy uses the service name as input to the DHTs hash Article 2 function to get the DHT key.",
                "The value that is stored in the DHT using this key is the URI of the registry along with the UDDI key of the service.",
                "This ensures that when the proxy registry queries for services with a certain name, it gets back the URI and UDDI keys for matching entries.",
                "Using these returned results, the proxy can do fast lookup operations at the respective UDDI registries.",
                "The UDDI keys make it unnecessary to repeat the search at the UDDI registries with the service name.",
                "We have so far described the process of exact match on service name.",
                "However there are additional types of search that must be supported.",
                "Firstly, the search requested could be case-insensitive.",
                "To support that, the proxy registry has to publish the same service once using the name exactly as entered in the UDDI registry, and once with the name converted to all lower-case letters.",
                "To do a case-insensitive search, the proxy registry simply has to convert the query string into lower-case letters.",
                "Secondly, the user could query based on the prefix of a service name.",
                "Indeed, this is the default behavior of search in UDDI.",
                "In other words, a wildcard is implicit at the end of the service name being searched.",
                "To support this efficiently in the DHT, our proxy registries have to take prefixes of the service name of varying length and publish the URI and UDDI key multiple times, once using each prefix.",
                "For example, the prefix sizes chosen in one deployment might be 5, 10, 15 and 20 characters.",
                "If a search for the first 12 characters of a service name is submitted, the proxy registry will query the DHT with the first 10 characters of the search string, and then refine the search result to ensure that the match extends to the 12th character.",
                "If the search string has less than 5 characters, and the search is for a prefix rather than an exact match, the DHT cannot be of any help, unless every service is published in the DHT with prefix of length 0.",
                "Using this null prefix will send a copy of every advertised service to the DHT node to which the hash of the null prefix maps.",
                "Since this can lead to load-imbalance, a better solution might be to use the DHT only to get a list of all UDDI registries, and send the search to all of them in the locations to be searched.",
                "Thirdly, the service name being searched can be a regular expression, such as one with embedded wildcard characters.",
                "For example, a search for Garden%s should match both Garden Supplies and Gardening Tools.",
                "This will be treated similarly to the previous case as the DHT has to be queried with the longest available prefix.",

                "In the architecture presented in [6], the service discovery function is assigned to a specialized Grid service called Registry.",
                "The implementation of the <br>web service</br> version of the Monitoring and Discovery Service (WS MDS), also known as the MDS4 component of the Globus Toolkit version 4 (GT4), includes such a registry in the form of the Index service Resource and service properties are collected and indexed by this service.",
                "Its basic function makes it similar to UDDI registry.",
                "To attain scalability, Index services from different Globus containers can register with each other in a hierarchical fashion to aggregate data.",
                "This approach for attaining scalability works best in hierarchical Virtual Organizations (VO), and expanding a search to find sufficient number of matches involves traversing the hierarchy.",
                "Specifically, this approach is not a good match for systems that try to exploit the convergence of grid and peer-to-peer computing [5]. 2.2 UDDI Beyond grid computing, the problem of service discovery needs to be addressed more generally in the web services community.",
                "Again, scalability is a major concern since millions of buyers looking for specific services need to find all the potential sellers of the service who can meet their needs.",
                "Although there are different ways of doing this, the web services standards committees address this requirement through a specification called UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration).",
                "A UDDI registry enables a business to enter three types of information in a UDDI registry - white pages, yellow pages and green pages.",
                "UDDIs intent is to function as a registry for services just as the yellow pages is a registry for businesses.",
                "Just like in Yellow pages, companies register themselves and their services under different categories.",
                "In UDDI, White Pages are a listing of the business entities.",
                "Green pages represent the technical information that is necessary to invoke a given service.",
                "Thus, by browsing a UDDI registry, a developer should be able to locate a service and a company and find out how to invoke the service.",
                "When UDDI was initially offered, it provided a lot of potential.",
                "However, today we find that UDDI has not been widely deployed in the Internet.",
                "In fact, the only known uses of UDDI are what are known as private UDDI registries within an enterprises boundaries.",

                "Again, scalability is a major concern since millions of buyers looking for specific services need to find all the potential sellers of the service who can meet their needs.",

                "The pattern of these links is known as the DHTs geometry.",
                "For example, in the Bamboo DHT [11], and in the Pastry DHT [8] on which Bamboo is based, nodes maintain links to neighboring nodes and to other distant nodes found in a routing table.",

                "Bamboo, like all DHTs, specifies algorithms to be followed when a node joins the overlay network, or when a node fails or leaves the network The geometry must be maintained even when this rate is high.",

                "UDDI nodes are replicated in a UDDI registry as per the current UDDI standard.",
                "However, each local registry has a local proxy registry that mediates between the local UDDI registry and the DHT Service.",

                "Figure 1: DUDE Architecture Service information can be dispersed to several UDDI registries to promote scalability.",
                "The proxy registry publishes, performs queries and deletes information from the dispersed UDDI registries.",
                "However, the scope of the queries is limited to relevant registries.",
                "The DHT provides information about the relevant registries.",
                "The core idea in the architecture is to populate DHT nodes with the necessary information from the proxies which enables easy and ubiquitous searching when queries are made.",
                "When a new service is added to a registry, all potential search terms are hashed by the proxy and used as DHT keys to publish the service in the DHT.",
                "The value stored for this service uniquely identifies the service, and includes the URL of a registry and the unique UDDI key of the service in that registry.",
                "Similarly when queries arrive, they are parsed and a set of search terms are identified.",
                "These search terms are hashed and the values stored with those hash values are retrieved from the DHT.",
                "Note that a proxy does not need to know all DHT nodes; it needs to know just one DHT node (this is done as part of the bootstrapping process) and as described in Section 2.3, this DHT node can route the query as necessary to the other nodes on the DHT overlay.",
                "We describe three usage scenarios later that deal with adding a new local registry, inserting a new service, and querying for a service.",
                "Furthermore, the DHT optimizes the UDDI query mechanism.",
                "This process becomes a lookup using a UDDI unique key rather than a query using a set of search parameters.",
                "This key and the URL of the registry are obtained by searching initially in the DHT.",
                "The DHT query can return multiple values for matching services, and in each of the matching registries, the proxy performs lookup operations.",
                "The service name is used as a hash for inserting the service information.",
                "The service information contains the query URL and unique UDDI key for the registry containing the service.",

                "We have so far described the process of exact match on service name.",
                "However there are additional types of search that must be supported.",
                "Firstly, the search requested could be case-insensitive.",

                "To do a case-insensitive search, the proxy registry simply has to convert the query string into lower-case letters.",
                "Secondly, the user could query based on the prefix of a service name.",
                "Indeed, this is the default behavior of search in UDDI.",
                "In other words, a wildcard is implicit at the end of the service name being searched.",
                "To support this efficiently in the DHT, our proxy registries have to take prefixes of the service name of varying length and publish the URI and UDDI key multiple times, once using each prefix.",
                "For example, the prefix sizes chosen in one deployment might be 5, 10, 15 and 20 characters.",
                "If a search for the first 12 characters of a service name is submitted, the proxy registry will query the DHT with the first 10 characters of the search string, and then refine the search result to ensure that the match extends to the 12th character.",
                "If the search string has less than 5 characters, and the search is for a prefix rather than an exact match, the DHT cannot be of any help, unless every service is published in the DHT with prefix of length 0.",
                "Using this null prefix will send a copy of every advertised service to the DHT node to which the hash of the null prefix maps.",
                "Since this can lead to load-imbalance, a better solution might be to use the DHT only to get a list of all UDDI registries, and send the search to all of them in the locations to be searched.",
                "Thirdly, the service name being searched can be a regular expression, such as one with embedded wildcard characters.",
                "For example, a search for Garden%s should match both Garden Supplies and Gardening Tools.",
                "This will be treated similarly to the previous case as the DHT has to be queried with the longest available prefix.",

                "The second motivating factor stems from the fact that DHTs are relatively new tool for building distributed applications and we would like to test its potential by applying it to the problem of distributing UDDI.",
                "In the next section, we provide a brief overview of grid information services, UDDI and its limitations, which is followed by an overview of DHTs in Section 3.",

                "In the architecture presented in [6], the service <br>discovery</br> function is assigned to a specialized Grid service called Registry.",
                "The implementation of the web service version of the Monitoring and <br>discovery</br> Service (WS MDS), also known as the MDS4 component of the Globus Toolkit version 4 (GT4), includes such a registry in the form of the Index service Resource and service properties are collected and indexed by this service.",
                "Its basic function makes it similar to UDDI registry.",
                "To attain scalability, Index services from different Globus containers can register with each other in a hierarchical fashion to aggregate data.",
                "This approach for attaining scalability works best in hierarchical Virtual Organizations (VO), and expanding a search to find sufficient number of matches involves traversing the hierarchy.",
                "Specifically, this approach is not a good match for systems that try to exploit the convergence of grid and peer-to-peer computing [5]. 2.2 UDDI Beyond grid computing, the problem of service <br>discovery</br> needs to be addressed more generally in the web services community.",
                "Again, scalability is a major concern since millions of buyers looking for specific services need to find all the potential sellers of the service who can meet their needs.",
                "Although there are different ways of doing this, the web services standards committees address this requirement through a specification called UDDI (Universal Description, <br>discovery</br>, and Integration).",
                "A UDDI registry enables a business to enter three types of information in a UDDI registry - white pages, yellow pages and green pages.",
                "UDDIs intent is to function as a registry for services just as the yellow pages is a registry for businesses.",
                "Just like in Yellow pages, companies register themselves and their services under different categories.",
                "In UDDI, White Pages are a listing of the business entities.",
                "Green pages represent the technical information that is necessary to invoke a given service.",
                "Thus, by browsing a UDDI registry, a developer should be able to locate a service and a company and find out how to invoke the service.",
                "When UDDI was initially offered, it provided a lot of potential.",
                "However, today we find that UDDI has not been widely deployed in the Internet.",
                "In fact, the only known uses of UDDI are what are known as private UDDI registries within an enterprises boundaries.",
                "The readers can refer to [7] for a recent article that discusses the shortcomings of UDDI and the properties of an ideal service registry.",
                "Improvement of the UDDI standard is continuing in full force and UDDI version 3 (V3) was recently approved as an OASIS Standard.",
                "However, UDDI today has issues that have not been addressed, such as scalability and autonomy of individual registries.",
                "UDDI V3 provides larger support for multi-registry environments based on portability of keys By allowing keys to be re-registered in multiple registries, the ability to link registries in various topologies is effectively enabled.",
                "However, no normative description of these topologies is provided in the UDDI specification at this point.",

                "A recommended deployment scenario proposed by the UDDI V3.0.2 Specification is to use the UDDI Business Registries as root registries, and it is possible to enable this using our solution. 2.3 Distributed Hash Tables A Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed system that forms a structured overlay allowing more efficient routing than the underlying network.",
                "It maintains a collection of key-value pairs on the nodes participating in this graph structure.",
                "For our deployment, a key is the hash of a keyword from a service name or description.",

                "Just like any other hash table data structure, it provides a simple interface consisting of put() and get() operations.",
                "This has to be done with robustness because of the transient nature of nodes in P2P systems.",
                "The value stored in the DHT can be any object or a copy or reference to it.",

                "The identifier space is assigned to the nodes in a distributed and deterministic fashion, so that routing and lookup can be performed efficiently.",
                "The nodes of a DHT maintain links to some of the other nodes in the DHT.",
                "The pattern of these links is known as the DHTs geometry.",
                "For example, in the Bamboo DHT [11], and in the Pastry DHT [8] on which Bamboo is based, nodes maintain links to neighboring nodes and to other distant nodes found in a routing table.",
                "The routing table entry at row i and column j, denoted Ri[j], is another node whose identifier matches its own in first i digits, and whose (i + 1)st digit is j.",
                "The routing table allows efficient overlay routing.",
                "Bamboo, like all DHTs, specifies algorithms to be followed when a node joins the overlay network, or when a node fails or leaves the network The geometry must be maintained even when this rate is high.",
                "To attain consistent routing or lookup, a DHT key must be routed to the node with the numerically closest identifier.",
                "For details of how the routing tables are constructed and maintained, the reader is referred to [8, 11]. 3.",
                "PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE OF DHT BASED UDDI REGISTRY HIERARCHIES As mentioned earlier, we propose to build a distributed UDDI system on top of a DHT infrastructure.",
                "This choice is primarily motivated by the simplicity of the put/get abstraction that DHTs provide, which is powerful enough for the task at hand, especially since we plan to validate our approach with an implementation running on PlanetLab [9].",
                "A secondary motivation is to understand deployment issues with DHT based systems.",
                "Several applications have been built as overlays using DHTs, such as distributed file storage, databases, publish-subscribe systems and content distribution networks.",
                "In our case, we are building a DHT based overlay network of UDDI registries, where the DHT acts as a rendezvous network that connects multiple registries.",
                "In the grid computing scenario, an overlay network of multiple UDDI registries seems to an interesting alternative to the UDDI public Article 2 registries currently maintained by Microsoft, IBM, SAP and NTT.",
                "In addition, our aim is to not change any of the UDDI interfaces for clients as well as publishers.",
                "Figure 1 highlights the proposed architecture for the DHT based UDDI Registry framework.",
                "UDDI nodes are replicated in a UDDI registry as per the current UDDI standard.",
                "However, each local registry has a local proxy registry that mediates between the local UDDI registry and the DHT Service.",
                "The DHT service is the glue that connects the Proxy Registries together and facilitates searching across registries.",
                "Figure 1: DUDE Architecture Service information can be dispersed to several UDDI registries to promote scalability.",
                "The proxy registry publishes, performs queries and deletes information from the dispersed UDDI registries.",
                "However, the scope of the queries is limited to relevant registries.",
                "The DHT provides information about the relevant registries.",
                "The core idea in the architecture is to populate DHT nodes with the necessary information from the proxies which enables easy and ubiquitous searching when queries are made.",
                "When a new service is added to a registry, all potential search terms are hashed by the proxy and used as DHT keys to publish the service in the DHT.",
                "The value stored for this service uniquely identifies the service, and includes the URL of a registry and the unique UDDI key of the service in that registry.",
                "Similarly when queries arrive, they are parsed and a set of search terms are identified.",
                "These search terms are hashed and the values stored with those hash values are retrieved from the DHT.",
                "Note that a proxy does not need to know all DHT nodes; it needs to know just one DHT node (this is done as part of the bootstrapping process) and as described in Section 2.3, this DHT node can route the query as necessary to the other nodes on the DHT overlay.",
                "We describe three usage scenarios later that deal with adding a new local registry, inserting a new service, and querying for a service.",
                "Furthermore, the DHT optimizes the UDDI query mechanism.",
                "This process becomes a lookup using a UDDI unique key rather than a query using a set of search parameters.",
                "This key and the URL of the registry are obtained by searching initially in the DHT.",
                "The DHT query can return multiple values for matching services, and in each of the matching registries, the proxy performs lookup operations.",
                "The service name is used as a hash for inserting the service information.",
                "The service information contains the query URL and unique UDDI key for the registry containing the service.",

                "The proxy uses the service name as input to the DHTs hash Article 2 function to get the DHT key.",
                "The value that is stored in the DHT using this key is the URI of the registry along with the UDDI key of the service.",
                "This ensures that when the proxy registry queries for services with a certain name, it gets back the URI and UDDI keys for matching entries.",
                "Using these returned results, the proxy can do fast lookup operations at the respective UDDI registries.",
                "The UDDI keys make it unnecessary to repeat the search at the UDDI registries with the service name.",
                "We have so far described the process of exact match on service name.",
                "However there are additional types of search that must be supported.",
                "Firstly, the search requested could be case-insensitive.",
                "To support that, the proxy registry has to publish the same service once using the name exactly as entered in the UDDI registry, and once with the name converted to all lower-case letters.",
                "To do a case-insensitive search, the proxy registry simply has to convert the query string into lower-case letters.",
                "Secondly, the user could query based on the prefix of a service name.",
                "Indeed, this is the default behavior of search in UDDI.",
                "In other words, a wildcard is implicit at the end of the service name being searched.",
                "To support this efficiently in the DHT, our proxy registries have to take prefixes of the service name of varying length and publish the URI and UDDI key multiple times, once using each prefix.",
                "For example, the prefix sizes chosen in one deployment might be 5, 10, 15 and 20 characters.",
                "If a search for the first 12 characters of a service name is submitted, the proxy registry will query the DHT with the first 10 characters of the search string, and then refine the search result to ensure that the match extends to the 12th character.",
                "If the search string has less than 5 characters, and the search is for a prefix rather than an exact match, the DHT cannot be of any help, unless every service is published in the DHT with prefix of length 0.",
                "Using this null prefix will send a copy of every advertised service to the DHT node to which the hash of the null prefix maps.",
                "Since this can lead to load-imbalance, a better solution might be to use the DHT only to get a list of all UDDI registries, and send the search to all of them in the locations to be searched.",
                "Thirdly, the service name being searched can be a regular expression, such as one with embedded wildcard characters.",
                "For example, a search for Garden%s should match both Garden Supplies and Gardening Tools.",
                "This will be treated similarly to the previous case as the DHT has to be queried with the longest available prefix.",
                "The results returned have to be refined to ensure that the regular expression matches.",

                "The proxy does a lookup of the DHT using the query string or a prefix.",
                "This involves contacting one of the DHT nodes, such as pli1-br3.hpl.hp.com, which serves as the gateway to the DHT for grouse.hpl.hp.com, based on the latters configuration file.",
                "The DHT node may then route the query to one of the other DHT nodes which is responsible for the DHT key that the query string maps to.",
