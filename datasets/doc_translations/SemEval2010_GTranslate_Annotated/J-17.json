This is a multidimensional scheduling domain, and the only known positive results for makespan minimization in such a domain are O(m)-approximation truthful mechanisms [22, 20]. We study a well-motivated special case of this problem, where the processing time of a job on each machine may either be low or high, and the low and high values are public and job-dependent. This preserves the multidimensionality of the domain, and generalizes the restricted-machines (i.e., {pj, ∞}) setting in scheduling. We give a general technique to convert any c-approximation algorithm to a 3capproximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism. This is one of the few known results that shows how to export approximation algorithms for a multidimensional problem into truthful mechanisms in a black-box fashion. When the low and high values are the same for all jobs, we devise a deterministic 2-approximation truthful mechanism. These are the first truthful mechanisms with non-trivial performance guarantees for a multidimensional scheduling domain. Our constructions are novel in two respects. First, we do not utilize or rely on explicit price definitions to prove truthfulness; instead we design algorithms that satisfy cycle monotonicity. Cycle monotonicity [23] is a necessary and sufficient condition for truthfulness, is a generalization of value monotonicity for multidimensional domains. However, whereas value monotonicity has been used extensively and successfully to design truthful mechanisms in singledimensional domains, ours is the first work that leverages cycle monotonicity in the multidimensional setting. Second, our randomized mechanisms are obtained by first constructing a fractional truthful mechanism for a fractional relaxation of the problem, and then converting it into a truthfulin-expectation mechanism. This builds upon a technique of [16], and shows the usefulness of fractional mechanisms in truthful mechanism design.

INTRODUCTION Mechanism design studies algorithmic constructions under the presence of strategic players who hold the inputs to the algorithm. Algorithmic mechanism design has focused mainly on settings were the social planner or designer wishes to maximize the social welfare (or equivalently, minimize social cost), or on auction settings where revenuemaximization is the main goal. Alternative optimization goals, such as those that incorporate fairness criteria (which have been investigated algorithmically and in social choice theory), have received very little or no attention. In this paper, we consider such an alternative goal in the context of machine scheduling, namely, makespan minimization. There are n jobs or tasks that need to be assigned to m machines, where each job has to be assigned to exactly one machine. Assigning a job j to a machine i incurs a load (cost) of pij ≥ 0 on machine i, and the load of a machine is the sum of the loads incurred due to the jobs assigned to it; the goal is to schedule the jobs so as to minimize the maximum load of a machine, which is termed the makespan of the schedule. Makespan minimization is a common objective in scheduling environments, and has been well studied algorithmically in both the Computer Science and Operations Research communities (see, e.g., the survey [12]). Following the work of Nisan and Ronen [22], we consider each machine to be a strategic player or agent who privately knows its own processing time for each job, and may misrepresent these values in order to decrease its load (which is its incurred cost). Hence, we approach the problem via mechanism design: the social designer, who holds the set of jobs to be assigned, needs to specify, in addition to a schedule, suitable payments to the players in order to incentivize them to reveal their true processing times. Such a mechanism is called a truthful mechanism. The makespan-minimization objective is quite different from the classic goal of social-welfare maximization, where one wants to maximize the total welfare (or minimize the total cost) of all players. Instead, it 252 corresponds to maximizing the minimum welfare and the notion of max-min fairness, and appears to be a much harder problem from the viewpoint of mechanism design. In particular, the celebrated VCG [26, 9, 10] family of mechanisms does not apply here, and we need to devise new techniques. The possibility of constructing a truthful mechanism for makespan minimization is strongly related to assumptions on the players processing times, in particular, the dimensionality of the domain. Nisan and Ronen considered the setting of unrelated machines where the pij values may be arbitrary. This is a multidimensional domain, since a players private value is its entire vector of processing times (pij)j. Very few positive results are known for multidimensional domains in general, and the only positive results known for multidimensional scheduling are O(m)-approximation truthful mechanisms [22, 20]. We emphasize that regardless of computational considerations, even the existence of a truthful mechanism with a significantly better (than m) approximation ratio is not known for any such scheduling domain. On the negative side, [22] showed that no truthful deterministic mechanism can achieve approximation ratio better than 2, and strengthened this lower bound to m for two specific classes of deterministic mechanisms. Recently, [20] extended this lower bound to randomized mechanisms, and [8] improved the deterministic lower bound. In stark contrast with the above state of affairs, much stronger (and many more) positive results are known for a special case of the unrelated machines problem, namely, the setting of related machines. Here, we have pij = pj/si for every i, j, where pj is public knowledge, and the speed si is the only private parameter of machine i. This assumption makes the domain of players types single-dimensional. Truthfulness in such domains is equivalent to a convenient value-monotonicity condition [21, 3], which appears to make it significantly easier to design truthful mechanisms in such domains. Archer and Tardos [3] first considered the related machines setting and gave a randomized 3-approximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism. The gap between the single-dimensional and multidimensional domains is perhaps best exemplified by the fact that [3] showed that there exists a truthful mechanism that always outputs an optimal schedule. (Recall that in the multidimensional unrelated machines setting, it is impossible to obtain a truthful mechanism with approximation ratio better than 2.) Various follow-up results [2, 4, 1, 13] have strengthened the notion of truthfulness and/or improved the approximation ratio. Such difficulties in moving from the single-dimensional to the multidimensional setting also arise in other mechanism design settings (e.g., combinatorial auctions). Thus, in addition to the specific importance of scheduling in strategic environments, ideas from multidimensional scheduling may also have a bearing in the more general context of truthful mechanism design for multidimensional domains. In this paper, we consider the makespan-minimization problem for a special case of unrelated machines, where the processing time of a job is either low or high on each machine. More precisely, in our setting, pij ∈ {Lj, Hj} for every i, j, where the Lj, Hj values are publicly known (Lj ≡low, Hj ≡high). We call this model the jobdependent two-values case. This model generalizes the classic restricted machines setting, where pij ∈ {Lj, ∞} which has been well-studied algorithmically. A special case of our model is when Lj = L and Hj = H for all jobs j, which we denote simply as the two-values scheduling model. Both of our domains are multidimensional, since the machines are unrelated: one job may be low on one machine and high on the other, while another job may follow the opposite pattern. Thus, the private information of each machine is a vector specifying which jobs are low and high on it. Thus, they retain the core property underlying the hardness of truthful mechanism design for unrelated machines, and by studying these special settings we hope to gain some insights that will be useful for tackling the general problem. Our Results and Techniques We present various positive results for our multidimensional scheduling domains. Our first result is a general method to convert any capproximation algorithm for the job-dependent two values setting into a 3c-approximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism. This is one of the very few known results that use an approximation algorithm in a black-box fashion to obtain a truthful mechanism for a multidimensional problem. Our result implies that there exists a 3-approximation truthfulin-expectation mechanism for the Lj-Hj setting. Interestingly, the proof of truthfulness is not based on supplying explicit prices, and our construction does not necessarily yield efficiently-computable prices (but the allocation rule is efficiently computable). Our second result applies to the twovalues setting (Lj = L, Hj = H), for which we improve both the approximation ratio and strengthen the notion of truthfulness. We obtain a deterministic 2-approximation truthful mechanism (along with prices) for this problem. These are the first truthful mechanisms with non-trivial performance guarantees for a multidimensional scheduling domain. Complementing this, we observe that even this seemingly simple setting does not admit truthful mechanisms that return an optimal schedule (unlike in the case of related machines). By exploiting the multidimensionality of the domain, we prove that no truthful deterministic mechanism can obtain an approximation ratio better than 1.14 to the makespan (irrespective of computational considerations). The main technique, and one of the novelties, underlying our constructions and proofs, is that we do not rely on explicit price specifications in order to prove the truthfulness of our mechanisms. Instead we exploit certain algorithmic monotonicity conditions that characterize truthfulness to first design an implementable algorithm, i.e., an algorithm for which prices ensuring truthfulness exist, and then find these prices (by further delving into the proof of implementability). This kind of analysis has been the method of choice in the design of truthful mechanisms for singledimensional domains, where value-monotonicity yields a convenient characterization enabling one to concentrate on the algorithmic side of the problem (see, e.g., [3, 7, 4, 1, 13]). But for multidimensional domains, almost all positive results have relied on explicit price specifications in order to prove truthfulness (an exception is the work on unknown single-minded players in combinatorial auctions [17, 7]), a fact that yet again shows the gap in our understanding of multidimensional vs. single-dimensional domains. Our work is the first to leverage monotonicity conditions for truthful mechanism design in arbitrary domains. The monotonicity condition we use, which is sometimes called cycle monotonicity, was first proposed by Rochet [23] (see also [11]). It is a generalization of value-monotonicity and completely characterizes truthfulness in every domain. Our methods and analyses demonstrate the potential benefits 253 of this characterization, and show that cycle monotonicity can be effectively utilized to devise truthful mechanisms for multidimensional domains. Consider, for example, our first result showing that any c-approximation algorithm can be exported to a 3c-approximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism. At the level of generality of an arbitrary approximation algorithm, it seems unlikely that one would be able to come up with prices to prove truthfulness of the constructed mechanism. But, cycle monotonicity does allow us to prove such a statement. In fact, some such condition based only on the underlying algorithm (and not on the prices) seems necessary to prove such a general statement. The method for converting approximation algorithms into truthful mechanisms involves another novel idea. Our randomized mechanism is obtained by first constructing a truthful mechanism that returns a fractional schedule. Moving to a fractional domain allows us to plug-in truthfulness into the approximation algorithm in a rather simple fashion, while losing a factor of 2 in the approximation ratio. We then use a suitable randomized rounding procedure to convert the fractional assignment into a random integral assignment. For this, we use a recent rounding procedure of Kumar et al. [14] that is tailored for unrelated-machine scheduling. This preserves truthfulness, but we lose another additive factor equal to the approximation ratio. Our construction uses and extends some observations of Lavi and Swamy [16], and further demonstrates the benefits of fractional mechanisms in truthful mechanism design. Related Work Nisan and Ronen [22] first considered the makespan-minimization problem for unrelated machines. They gave an m-approximation positive result and proved various lower bounds. Recently, Mualem and Schapira [20] proved a lower bound of 2 on the approximation ratio achievable by truthful-in-expectation mechanisms, and Christodoulou, Koutsoupias, and Vidali [8] proved a (1 + √ 2)-lower bound for deterministic truthful mechanisms.Archer and Tardos [3] first considered the related-machines problem and gave a 3-approximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism. This been improved in [2, 4, 1, 13] to: a 2-approximation randomized mechanism [2]; an FPTAS for any fixed number of machines given by Andelman, Azar and Sorani [1], and a 3-approximation deterministic mechanism by Kov´acs [13]. The algorithmic problem (i.e., without requiring truthfulness) of makespan-minimization on unrelated machines is well understood and various 2-approximation algorithms are known. Lenstra, Shmoys and Tardos [18] gave the first such algorithm. Shmoys and Tardos [25] later gave a 2approximation algorithm for the generalized assignment problem, a generalization where there is a cost cij for assigning a job j to a machine i, and the goal is to minimize the cost subject to a bound on the makespan. Recently, Kumar, Marathe, Parthasarathy, and Srinivasan [14] gave a randomized rounding algorithm that yields the same bounds. We use their procedure in our randomized mechanism. The characterization of truthfulness for arbitrary domains in terms of cycle monotonicity seems to have been first observed by Rochet [23] (see also Gui et al. [11]). This generalizes the value-monotonicity condition for single-dimensional domains which was given by Myerson [21] and rediscovered by [3]. As mentioned earlier, this condition has been exploited numerous times to obtain truthful mechanisms for single-dimensional domains [3, 7, 4, 1, 13]. For convex domains (i.e., each players set of private values is convex), it is known that cycle monotonicity is implied by a simpler condition, called weak monotonicity [15, 6, 24]. But even this simpler condition has not found much application in truthful mechanism design for multidimensional problems. Objectives other than social-welfare maximization and revenue maximization have received very little attention in mechanism design. In the context of combinatorial auctions, the problems of maximizing the minimum value received by a player, and computing an envy-minimizing allocation have been studied briefly. Lavi, Mualem, and Nisan [15] showed that the former objective cannot be implemented truthfully; Bezakova and Dani [5] gave a 0.5-approximation mechanism for two players with additive valuations. Lipton et al. [19] showed that the latter objective cannot be implemented truthfully. These lower bounds were strengthened in [20]. 2. PRELIMINARIES 2.1 The scheduling domain In our scheduling problem, we are given n jobs and m machines, and each job must be assigned to exactly one machine. In the unrelated-machines setting, each machine i is characterized by a vector of processing times (pij)j, where pij ∈ R≥0 ∪ {∞} denotes is processing time for job j with the value ∞ specifying that i cannot process j. We consider two special cases of this problem: 1. The job-dependent two-values case, where pij ∈ {Lj, Hj} for every i, j, with Lj ≤ Hj, and the values Lj, Hj are known. This generalizes the classic scheduling model of restricted machines, where Hj = ∞. 2. The two-values case, which is a special case of above where Lj = L and Hj = H for all jobs j, i.e., pij ∈ {L, H} for every i, j. We say that a job j is low on machine i if pij = Lj, and high if pij = Hj. We will use the terms schedule and assignment interchangeably. We represent a deterministic schedule by a vector x = (xij)i,j, where xij is 1 if job j is assigned to machine i, thus we have xij ∈ {0, 1} for every i, j, P i xij = 1 for every job j. We will also consider randomized algorithms and algorithms that return a fractional assignment. In both these settings, we will again specify an assignment by a vector x = (xij)i,j with P j xij = 1, but now xij ∈ [0, 1] for every i, j. For a randomized algorithm, xij is simply the probability that j is assigned to i (thus, x is a convex combination of integer assignments). We denote the load of machine i (under a given assignment) by li = P j xijpij, and the makespan of a schedule is defined as the maximum load on any machine, i.e., maxi li. The goal in the makespan-minimization problem is to assign the jobs to the machines so as to minimize the makespan of the schedule. 2.2 Mechanism design We consider the makespan-minimization problem in the above scheduling domains in the context of mechanism design. Mechanism design studies strategic settings where the social designer needs to ensure the cooperation of the different entities involved in the algorithmic procedure. Following the work of Nisan and Ronen [22], we consider the machines to be the strategic players or agents. The social designer holds the set of jobs that need to be assigned, but does 254 not know the (true) processing times of these jobs on the different machines. Each machine is a selfish entity, that privately knows its own processing time for each job. on a machine incurs a cost to the machine equal to the true processing time of the job on the machine, and a machine may choose to misrepresent its vector of processing times, which are private, in order to decrease its cost. We consider direct-revelation mechanisms: each machine reports its (possibly false) vector of processing times, the mechanism then computes a schedule and hands out payments to the players (i.e., machines) to compensate them for the cost they incur in processing their assigned jobs. A (direct-revelation) mechanism thus consists of a tuple (x, P): x specifies the schedule, and P = {Pi} specifies the payments handed out to the machines, where both x and the Pis are functions of the reported processing times p = (pij)i,j. The mechanisms goal is to compute a schedule that has near-optimal makespan with respect to the true processing times; a machine i is however only interested in maximizing its own utility, Pi − li, where li is its load under the output assignment, and may declare false processing times if this could increase its utility. The mechanism must therefore incentivize the machines/players to truthfully reveal their processing times via the payments. This is made precise using the notion of dominant-strategy truthfulness. Definition 2.1 (Truthfulness) A scheduling mechanism is truthful if, for every machine i, every vector of processing times of the other machines, p−i, every true processing-time vector p1 i and any other vector p2 i of machine i, we have: P1 i − X j x1 ijp1 ij ≥ P2 i − X j x2 ijp1 ij, (1) where (x1 , P1 ) and (x2 , P2 ) are respectively the schedule and payments when the other machines declare p−i and machine i declares p1 i and p2 i , i.e., x1 = x(p1 i , p−i), P1 i = Pi(p1 i , p−i) and x2 = x(p2 i , p−i), P2 i = Pi(p2 i , p−i). To put it in words, in a truthful mechanism, no machine can improve its utility by declaring a false processing time, no matter what the other machines declare. We will also consider fractional mechanisms that return a fractional assignment, and randomized mechanisms that are allowed to toss coins and where the assignment and the payments may be random variables. The notion of truthfulness for a fractional mechanism is the same as in Definition 2.1, where x1 , x2 are now fractional assignments. For a randomized mechanism, we will consider the notion of truthfulness in expectation [3], which means that a machine (player) maximizes her expected utility by declaring her true processing-time vector. Inequality (1) also defines truthfulness-in-expectation for a randomized mechanism, where P1 i , P2 i now denote the expected payments made to player i, x1 , x2 are the fractional assignments denoting the randomized algorithms schedule (i.e., xk ij is the probability that j is assigned to i in the schedule output for (pk i , p−i)). For our two scheduling domains, the informational assumption is that the values Lj, Hj are publicly known. The private information of a machine is which jobs have value Lj (or L) and which ones have value Hj (or H) on it. We emphasize that both of our domains are multidimensional, since each machine i needs to specify a vector saying which jobs are low and high on it. 3. CYCLE MONOTONICITY Although truthfulness is defined in terms of payments, it turns out that truthfulness actually boils down to a certain algorithmic condition of monotonicity. This seems to have been first observed for multidimensional domains by Rochet [23] in 1987, and has been used successfully in algorithmic mechanism design several times, but for singledimensional domains. However for multidimensional domains, the monotonicity condition is more involved and there has been no success in employing it in the design of truthful mechanisms. Most positive results for multidimensional domains have relied on explicit price specifications in order to prove truthfulness. One of the main contributions of this paper is to demonstrate that the monotonicity condition for multidimensional settings, which is sometimes called cycle monotonicity, can indeed be effectively utilized to devise truthful mechanisms. We include a brief exposition on it for completeness. The exposition here is largely based on [11]. Cycle monotonicity is best described in the abstract social choice setting: there is a finite set A of alternatives, there are m players, and each player has a private type (valuation function) v : A → R, where vi(a) should be interpreted as is value for alternative a. In the scheduling domain, A represents all the possible assignments of jobs to machines, and vi(a) is the negative of is load in the schedule a. Let Vi denote the set of all possible types of player i. A mechanism is a tuple (f, {Pi}) where f : V1 × · · · × Vm → A is the algorithm for choosing the alternative, and Pi : V1 × · · · × Vm → A is the price charged to player i (in the scheduling setting, the mechanism pays the players, which corresponds to negative prices). The mechanism is truthful if for every i, every v−i ∈ V−i = Q i =i Vi , and any vi, vi ∈ Vi we have vi(a) − Pi(vi, v−i) ≥ vi(b) − Pi(vi, v−i), where a = f(vi, v−i) and b = f(vi, v−i). A basic question that arises is given an algorithm f : V1 × · · · × Vm → A, do there exist prices that will make the resulting mechanism truthful? It is well known (see e.g. [15]) that the price Pi can only depend on the alternative chosen and the others declarations, that is, we may write Pi : V−i × A → R. Thus, truthfulness implies that for every i, every v−i ∈ V−i, and any vi, vi ∈ Vi with f(vi, v−i) = a and f(vi, v−i) = b, we have vi(a) − Pi(a, v−i) ≥ vi(b) − Pi(b, v−i). Now fix a player i, and fix the declarations v−i of the others. We seek an assignment to the variables {Pa}a∈A such that vi(a) − vi(b) ≥ Pa − Pb for every a, b ∈ A and vi ∈ Vi with f(vi, v−i) = a. (Strictly speaking, we should use A = f(Vi, v−i) instead of A here.) Define δa,b := inf{vi(a)− vi(b) : vi ∈ Vi, f(vi, v−i) = a}. We can now rephrase the above price-assignment problem: we seek an assignment to the variables {Pa}a∈A such that Pa − Pb ≤ δa,b ∀a, b ∈ A (2) This is easily solved by looking at the allocation graph and applying a standard basic result of graph theory. Definition 3.1 (Gui et al. [11]) The allocation graph of f is a directed weighted graph G = (A, E) where E = A × A and the weight of an edge b → a (for any a, b ∈ A) is δa,b. Theorem 3.2 There exists a feasible assignment to (2) iff the allocation graph has no negative-length cycles. Furthermore, if all cycles are non-negative, a feasible assignment is 255 obtained as follows: fix an arbitrary node a∗ ∈ A and set Pa to be the length of the shortest path from a∗ to a. This leads to the following definition, which is another way of phrasing the condition that the allocation graph have no negative cycles. Definition 3.3 (Cycle monotonicity) A social choice function f satisfies cycle monotonicity if for every player i, every v−i ∈ V−i, every integer K, and every v1 i , . . . , vK i ∈ Vi, KX k=1 h vk i (ak) − vk i (ak+1) i ≥ 0 where ak = f(vk i , v−i) for 1 ≤ k ≤ K, and aK+1 = a1. Corollary 3.4 There exist prices P such that the mechanism (f, P) is truthful iff f satisfies cycle monotonicity.1 We now consider our specific scheduling domain. Fix a player i, p−i, and any p1 i , . . . , pK i . Let x(pk i , p−i) = xk for 1 ≤ k ≤ K, and let xK+1 = x1 , pK+1 = p1 . xk could be a {0, 1}-assignment or a fractional assignment. We have vk i (xk ) = − P j xk ijpk ij, so cycle monotonicity translates to PK k=1 ˆ − P j xk ijpk ij + P j xk+1 ij pk ij ˜ ≥ 0. Rearranging, we get KX k=1 X j xk+1 ij ` pk ij − pk+1 ij ´ ≥ 0. (3) Thus (3) reduces our mechanism design problem to a concrete algorithmic problem. For most of this paper, we will consequently ignore any strategic considerations and focus on designing an approximation algorithm for minimizing makespan that satisfies (3). 4. A GENERAL TECHNIQUE TO OBTAIN RANDOMIZED MECHANISMS In this section, we consider the case of job-dependent Lj, Hj values (with Lj ≤ Hj), which generalizes the classical restricted-machines model (where Hj = ∞). We show the power of randomization, by providing a general technique that converts any c-approximation algorithm into a 3c-approximation, truthful-in-expectation mechanism. This is one of the few results that shows how to export approximation algorithms for a multidimensional problem into truthful mechanisms when the algorithm is given as a black box. Our construction and proof are simple, and based on two ideas. First, as outlined above, we prove truthfulness using cycle monotonicity. It seems unlikely that for an arbitrary approximation algorithm given only as a black box, one would be able to come up with payments in order to prove truthfulness; but cycle-monotonicity allows us to prove precisely this. Second, we obtain our randomized mechanism by (a) first moving to a fractional domain, and constructing a fractional truthful mechanism that is allowed to return fractional assignments; then (b) using a rounding procedure to express the fractional schedule as a convex combination of integer schedules. This builds upon a theme introduced by Lavi and Swamy [16], namely that of using fractional mechanisms to obtain truthful-in-expectation mechanisms. 1 It is not clear if Theorem 3.2, and hence, this statement, hold if A is not finite. We should point out however that one cannot simply plug in the results of [16]. Their results hold for social-welfaremaximization problems and rely on using VCG to obtain a fractional truthful mechanism. VCG however does not apply to makespan minimization, and in our case even the existence of a near-optimal fractional truthful mechanism is not known. We use the following result adapted from [16]. Lemma 4.1 (Lavi and Swamy [16]) Let M = (x, P) be a fractional truthful mechanism. Let A be a randomized rounding algorithm that given a fractional assignment x, outputs a random assignment X such that E ˆ Xij ˜ = xij for all i, j. Then there exist payments P such that the mechanism M = (A, P ) is truthful in expectation. Furthermore, if M is individually rational then M is individually rational for every realization of coin tosses. Let OPT(p) denote the optimal makespan (over integer schedules) for instance p. As our first step, we take a capproximation algorithm and convert it to a 2c-approximation fractional truthful mechanism. This conversion works even when the approximation algorithm returns only a fractional schedule (satisfying certain properties) of makespan at most c · OPT(p) for every instance p. We prove truthfulness by showing that the fractional algorithm satisfies cycle monotonicity (3). Notice that the alternative-set of our fractional mechanism is finite (although the set of all fractional assignments is infinite): its cardinality is at most that of the inputdomain, which is at most 2mn in the two-value case. Thus, we can apply Corollary 3.4 here. To convert this fractional truthful mechanism into a randomized truthful mechanism we need a randomized rounding procedure satisfying the requirements of Lemma 4.1. Fortunately, such a procedure is already provided by Kumar, Marathe, Parthasarathy, and Srinivasan [14]. Lemma 4.2 (Kumar et al. [14]) Given a fractional assignment x and a processing time vector p, there exists a randomized rounding procedure that yields a (random) assignment X such that, 1. for any i, j, E ˆ Xij ˜ = xij. 2. for any i, P j Xijpij < P j xijpij + max{j:xij ∈(0,1)} pij with probability 1. Property 1 will be used to obtain truthfulness in expectation, and property 2 will allow us to prove an approximation guarantee. We first show that any algorithm that returns a fractional assignment having certain properties satisfies cycle monotonicity. Lemma 4.3 Let A be an algorithm that for any input p, outputs a (fractional) assignment x such that, if pij = Hj then xij ≤ 1/m, and if pij = Lj then xij ≥ 1/m. Then A satisfies cycle-monotonicity. Proof. Fix a player i, and the vector of processing times of the other players p−i. We need to prove (3), that is, PK k=1 P j xk+1 ij ` pk ij − pk+1 ij ´ ≥ 0 for every p1 i , . . . , pK i , where index k = K + 1 is taken to be k = 1. We will show that for every job j, PK k=1 xk+1 ij ` pk ij − pk+1 ij ´ ≥ 0. If pk ij is the same for all k (either always Lj or always Hj), then the above inequality clearly holds. Otherwise we can 256 divide the indices 1, . . . , K, into maximal segments, where a maximal segment is a maximal set of consecutive indices k , k + 1, . . . , k − 1, k (where K + 1 ≡ 1) such that pk ij = Hj ≥ pk +1 ij ≥ · · · ≥ pk ij = Lj. This follows because there must be some k such that pk ij = Hj > pk−1 ij = Lj. We take k = k and then keep including indices in this segment till we reach a k such that pk ij = Lj and pk+1 ij = Hj. We set k = k, and then start a new maximal segment with index k + 1. Note that k = k and k + 1 = k − 1. We now have a subset of indices and we can continue recursively. So all indices are included in some maximal segment. We will show that for every such maximal segment k , k +1, . . . , k ,P k −1≤k<k xk+1 ij ` pk ij − pk+1 ij ´ ≥ 0. Adding this for each segment yields the desired inequality. So now focus on a maximal segment k , k + 1, . . . , k − 1, k . Thus, there is some k∗ such that for k ≤ k < k∗ , we have pk ij = Hj, and for k∗ ≤ k ≤ k , we have pk ij = Lj. Now the left hand side of the above inequality for this segment is simply xk ij (Lj −Hj)+xk∗ ij (Hj −Lj) ≥ 0, since xk ij ≤ 1 m ≤ xk∗ ij as pk ij = Hj and pk∗ ij = Lj. We now describe how to use a c-approximation algorithm to obtain an algorithm satisfying the property in Lemma 4.3. For simplicity, first suppose that the approximation algorithm returns an integral schedule. The idea is to simply spread this schedule. We take each job j assigned to a high machine and assign it to an extent 1/m on all machines; for each job j assigned to a low machine, say i, we assign 1/m-fraction of it to the other machines where it is low, and assign its remaining fraction (which is at least 1/m) to i. The resulting assignment clearly satisfies the desired properties. Also observe that the load on any machine has at most increased by 1 m · (load on other machines) ≤ makespan, and hence the makespan has at most doubled. This spreading out can also be done if the initial schedule is fractional. We now describe the algorithm precisely. Algorithm 1 Let A be any algorithm that on any input p outputs a possibly fractional assignment x such that xij > 0 implies that pij ≤ T, where T is the makespan of x. (In particular, note that any algorithm that returns an integral assignment has these properties.) Our algorithm, which we call A , returns the following assignment xF . Initialize xF ij = 0 for all i, j. For every i, j, 1. if pij = Hj, set xF ij = P i :pi j =Hj xi j/m; 2. if pij = Lj, set xF ij = xij + P i =i:pi j =Lj (xi j −xij)/m+ P i :pi j =Hj xi j/m. Theorem 4.4 Suppose algorithm A satisfies the conditions in Algorithm 1 and returns a makespan of at most c·OPT(p) for every p. Then, the algorithm A constructed above is a 2c-approximation, cycle-monotone fractional algorithm. Moreover, if xF ij > 0 on input p, then pij ≤ c · OPT(p). Proof. First, note that xF is a valid assignment: for every job j, P i xF ij = P i xij + P i,i =i:pij =pi j =Lj (xi j − xij)/m = P i xij = 1. We also have that if pij = Hj then xF ij = P i :pi j =Hj xi j/m ≤ 1/m. If pij = Lj, then xF ij = xij(1 − /m) + P i =i xi j/m where = |{i = i : pi j = Lj}| ≤ m − 1; so xF ij ≥ P i xi j/m ≥ 1/m. Thus, by Lemma 4.3, A satisfies cycle monotonicity. The total load on any machine i under xF is at mostP j:pij =Hj P i :pi j =Hj Hj· xi j m + P j:pij =Lj Lj ` xij+ P i =i xi j m ´ , which is at most P j pijxij + P i =i P j pi jxi j/m ≤ 2c · OPT(p). Finally, if xF ij > 0 and pij = Lj, then pij ≤ OPT(p). If pij = Hj, then for some i (possibly i) with pi j = Hj we have xi j > 0, so by assumption, pi j = Hj = pij ≤ c · OPT(p). Theorem 4.4 combined with Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2, gives a 3c-approximation, truthful-in-expectation mechanism. The computation of payments will depend on the actual approximation algorithm used. Section 3 does however give an explicit procedure to compute payments ensuring truthfulness, though perhaps not in polynomial-time. Theorem 4.5 The procedure in Algorithm 1 converts any c-approximation fractional algorithm into a 3c-approximation, truthful-in-expectation mechanism. Taking A in Algorithm 1 to be the algorithm that returns an LP-optimum assignment satisfying the required conditions (see [18, 25]), we obtain a 3-approximation mechanism. Corollary 4.6 There is a truthful-in-expectation mechanism with approximation ratio 3 for the Lj-Hj setting. 5. A DETERMINISTIC MECHANISM FOR THE TWO-VALUES CASE We now present a deterministic 2-approximation truthful mechanism for the case where pij ∈ {L, H} for all i, j. In the sequel, we will often say that j is assigned to a lowmachine to denote that j is assigned to a machine i where pij = L. We will call a job j a low job of machine i if pij = L; the low-load of i is the load on i due to its low jobs, i.e., P j:pij =L xijpij. As in Section 4, our goal is to obtain an approximation algorithm that satisfies cycle monotonicity. We first obtain a simplification of condition (3) for our two-values {L, H} scheduling domain (Proposition 5.1) that will be convenient to work with. We describe our algorithm in Section 5.1. In Section 5.2, we bound its approximation guarantee and prove that it satisfies cycle-monotonicity. In Section 5.3, we compute explicit payments giving a truthful mechanism. Finally, in Section 5.4 we show that no deterministic mechanism can achieve the optimum makespan. Define nk, H = ˛ ˛{j : xk ij = 1, pk ij = L, pij = H} ˛ ˛ (4) nk, L = ˛ ˛{j : xk ij = 1, pk ij = H, pij = L} ˛ ˛. (5) Then, P j xk+1 ij (pk ij − pk+1 ij ) = (nk+1,k H − nk+1,k L )(H − L). Plugging this into (3) and dividing by (H − L), we get the following. Proposition 5.1 Cycle monotonicity in the two-values scheduling domain is equivalent to the condition that, for every player i, every p−i, every integer K, and every p1 i , . . . , pK i , KX k=1 ` nk+1,k H − nk+1,k L ´ ≥ 0. (6) 257 5.1 Acycle-monotone approximation algorithm We now describe an algorithm that satisfies condition (6) and achieves a 2-approximation. We will assume that L, H are integers, which is without loss of generality. A core component of our algorithm will be a procedure that takes an integer load threshold T and computes an integer partial assignment x of jobs to machines such that (a) a job is only assigned to a low machine; (b) the load on any machine is at most T; and (c) the number of jobs assigned is maximized. Such an assignment can be computed by solving a max-flow problem: we construct a directed bipartite graph with a node for every job j and every machine i, and an edge (j, i) of infinite capacity if pij = L. We also add a source node s with edges (s, j) having capacity 1, and sink node t with edges (i, t) having capacity T/L . Clearly any integer flow in this network corresponds to a valid integer partial assignment x of makespan at most T, where xij = 1 iff there is a flow of 1 on the edge from j to i. We will therefore use the terms assignment and flow interchangeably. Moreover, there is always an integral max-flow (since all capacities are integers). We will often refer to such a max-flow as the max-flow for (p, T). We need one additional concept before describing the algorithm. There could potentially be many max-flows and we will be interested in the most balanced ones, which we formally define as follows. Fix some max-flow. Let ni p,T be the amount of flow on edge (i, t) (or equivalently the number of jobs assigned to i in the corresponding schedule), and let np,T be the total size of the max-flow, i.e., np,T = P i ni p,T . For any T ≤ T, define ni p,T |T = min(ni p,T , T ), that is, we truncate the flow/assignment on i so that the total load on i is at most T . Define np,T |T = P i ni p,T |T . We define a prefix-maximal flow or assignment for T as follows. Definition 5.2 (Prefix-maximal flow) A flow for the above network with threshold T is prefix-maximal if for every integer T ≤ T, we have np,T |T = np,T . That is, in a prefix-maximal flow for (p, T), if we truncate the flow at some T ≤ T, we are left with a max-flow for (p, T ). An elementary fact about flows is that if an assignment/flow x is not a maximum flow for (p, T) then there must be an augmenting path P = (s, j1, i1, . . . , jK , iK , t) in the residual graph that allows us to increase the size of the flow. The interpretation is that in the current assignment, j1 is unassigned, xi j = 0, which is denoted by the forward edges (j , i ), and xi j +1 = 1, which is denoted by the reverse edges (i , j +1). Augmenting x using P changes the assignment so that each j is assigned to i in the new assignment, which increases the value of the flow by 1. A simple augmenting path does not decrease the load of any machine; thus, one can argue that a prefix-maximal flow for a threshold T always exists. We first compute a max-flow for threshold 1, use simple augmenting paths to augment it to a max-flow for threshold 2, and repeat, each time augmenting the max-flow for the previous threshold t to a max-flow for threshold t + 1 using simple augmenting paths. Algorithm 2 Given a vector of processing times p, construct an assignment of jobs to machines as follows. 1. Compute T∗ (p) = min ˘ T ≥ H, T multiple of L : np,T · L + (n − np,T ) · H ≤ m · T ¯ . Note that np,T ·L+(n−np,T )·H −m·T is a decreasing function of T, so T∗ (p) can be computed in polynomial time via binary search. 2. Compute a prefix-maximal flow for threshold T∗ (p) and the corresponding partial assignment (i.e., j is assigned to i iff there is 1 unit of flow on edge (j, i)). 3. Assign the remaining jobs, i.e., the jobs unassigned in the flow-phase, in a greedy manner as follows. Consider these jobs in an arbitrary order and assign each job to the machine with the current lowest load (where the load includes the jobs assigned in the flow-phase). Our algorithm needs to compute a prefix-maximal assignment for the threshold T∗ (p). The proof showing the existence of a prefix-maximal flow only yields a pseudopolynomial time algorithm for computing it. But notice that the max-flow remains the same for any T ≥ T = n · L. So a prefix-maximal flow for T is also prefix-maximal for any T ≥ T . Thus, we only need to compute a prefix-maximal flow for T = min{T∗ (p), T }. This can be be done in polynomial time by using the iterative-augmenting-paths algorithm in the existence proof to compute iteratively the maxflow for the polynomially many multiples of L up to (and including) T . Theorem 5.3 One can efficiently compute payments that when combined with Algorithm 2 yield a deterministic 2approximation truthful mechanism for the two-values scheduling domain. 5.2 Analysis Let OPT(p) denote the optimal makespan for p. We now prove that Algorithm 2 is a 2-approximation algorithm that satisfies cycle monotonicity. This will then allow us to compute payments in Section 5.3 and prove Theorem 5.3. 5.2.1 Proof of approximation Claim 5.4 If OPT(p) < H, the makespan is at most OPT(p). Proof. If OPT(p) < H, it must be that the optimal schedule assigns all jobs to low machines, so np,OPT(p) = n. Thus, we have T∗ (p) = L · H L . Furthermore, since we compute a prefix-maximal flow for threshold T∗ (p) we have np,T ∗(p)|OPT(p) = np,OPT(p) = n, which implies that the load on each machine is at most OPT(p). So in this case the makespan is at most (and hence exactly) OPT(p). Claim 5.5 If OPT(p) ≥ H, then T∗ (p) ≤ L · OPT(p) L ≤ OPT(p) + L. Proof. Let nOPT(p) be the number of jobs assigned to low machines in an optimum schedule. The total load on all machines is exactly nOPT(p) · L + (n − nOPT(p)) · H, and is at most m · OPT(p), since every machine has load at most OPT(p). So taking T = L · OPT(p) L ≥ H, since np,T ≥ nOPT(p) we have that np,T ·L+(n−np,T )·H ≤ m·T. Hence, T∗ (p), the smallest such T, is at most L · OPT(p) L . Claim 5.6 Each job assigned in step 3 of the algorithm is assigned to a high machine. 258 Proof. Suppose j is assigned to machine i in step 3. If pij = L, then we must have ni p,T ∗(p) = T∗ (p), otherwise we could have assigned j to i in step 2 to obtain a flow of larger value. So at the point just before j is assigned in step 3, the load of each machine must be at least T∗ (p). Hence, the total load after j is assigned is at least m · T∗ (p) + L > m · T∗ (p). But the total load is also at most np,T ∗(p) · L + (n − np,T ∗(p)) · H ≤ m · T∗ (p), yielding a contradiction. Lemma 5.7 The above algorithm returns a schedule with makespan at most OPT(p)+max ˘ L, H(1− 1 m ) ¯ ≤ 2·OPT(p). Proof. If OPT(p) < H, then by Claim 5.4, we are done. So suppose OPT(p) ≥ H. By Claim 5.5, we know that T∗ (p) ≤ OPT(p) + L. If there are no unassigned jobs after step 2 of the algorithm, then the makespan is at most T∗ (p) and we are done. So assume that there are some unassigned jobs after step 2. We will show that the makespan after step 3 is at most T +H ` 1− 1 m ´ where T = min ˘ T∗ (p), OPT(p) ¯ . Suppose the claim is false. Let i be the machine with the maximum load, so li > T + H ` 1 − 1 m ´ . Let j be the last job assigned to i in step 3, and consider the point just before it is assigned to i. So li > T − H/m at this point. Also since j is assigned to i, by our greedy rule, the load on all the other machines must be at least li. So the total load after j is assigned, is at least H + m · li > m · T (since pij = H by Claim 5.6). Also, for any assignment of jobs to machines in step 3, the total load is at most np,T ∗(p) · L + (n − np,T ∗(p)) · H since there are np,T ∗(p) jobs assigned to low machines. Therefore, we must have m · T < np,T ∗(p) · L + (n − np,T ∗(p)) · H. But we will argue that m · T ≥ np,T ∗(p) ·L+(n−np,T ∗(p))·H, which yields a contradiction. If T = T∗ (p), this follows from the definition of T∗ (p). If T = OPT(p), then letting nOPT(p) denote the number of jobs assigned to low machines in an optimum schedule, we have np,T ∗(p) ≥ nOPT(p). So np,T ∗(p) ·L+(n−np,T ∗(p))·H ≤ nOPT(p) ·L+(n−nOPT(p))·H. This is exactly the total load in an optimum schedule, which is at most m · OPT(p). 5.2.2 Proof of cycle monotonicity Lemma 5.8 Consider any two instances p = (pi, p−i) and p = (pi, p−i) where pi ≥ pi, i.e., pij ≥ pij ∀j. If T is a threshold such that np,T > np ,T , then every maximum flow x for (p , T) must assign all jobs j such that pij = L. Proof. Let Gp denote the residual graph for (p , T) and flow x . Suppose by contradiction that there exists a job j∗ with pij∗ = L that is unassigned by x . Since pi ≥ pi, all edges (j, i) that are present in the network for (p , T) are also present in the network for (p, T). Thus, x is a valid flow for (p, T). But it is not a max-flow, since np,T > np ,T . So there exists an augmenting path P in the residual graph for (p, T) and flow x . Observe that node i must be included in P, otherwise P would also be an augmenting path in the residual graph Gp contradicting the fact that x is a maxflow. In particular, this implies that there is a path P ⊂ P from i to the sink t. Let P = (i, j1, i1, . . . , jK , iK , t). All the edges of P are also present as edges in Gp - all reverse edges (i , j +1) are present since such an edge implies that xi j +1 = 1; all forward edges (j , i ) are present since i = i so pi j = pi j = L, and xi j +1 = 0. But then there is an augmenting path (j∗ , i, j1, i1, . . . , jK , iK , t) in Gp which contradicts the maximality of x . Let L denote the all-low processing time vector. Define TL i (p−i) = T∗ (L, p−i). Since we are focusing on machine i, and p−i is fixed throughout, we abbreviate TL i (p−i) to TL . Also, let pL = (L, p−i). Note that T∗ (p) ≥ TL for every instance p = (pi, p−i). Corollary 5.9 Let p = (pi, p−i) be any instance and let x be any prefix-maximal flow for (p, T∗ (p)). Then, the low-load on machine i is at most TL . Proof. Let T∗ = T∗ (p). If T∗ = TL , then this is clearly true. Otherwise, consider the assignment x truncated at TL . Since x is prefix-maximal, we know that this constitutes a max-flow for (p, TL ). Also, np,T L < npL,T L because T∗ > TL . So by Lemma 5.8, this truncated flow must assign all the low jobs of i. Hence, there cannot be a job j with pij = L that is assigned to i after the TL -threshold since then j would not be assigned by this truncated flow. Thus, the low-load of i is at most TL . Using these properties, we will prove the following key inequality: for any p1 = (p−i, p1 i ) and p2 = (p−i, p2 i ), np1,T L ≥ np2,T L − n2,1 H + n2,1 L (7) where n2,1 H and n2,1 L are as defined in (4) and (5), respectively. Notice that this immediately implies cycle monotonicity, since if we take p1 = pk and p2 = pk+1 , then (7) implies that npk,T L ≥ npk+1,T L − nk+1,k H + nk+1,k L ; summing this over all k = 1, . . . , K gives (6). Lemma 5.10 If T∗ (p1 ) > TL , then (7) holds. Proof. Let T1 = T∗ (p1 ) and T2 = T∗ (p2 ). Take the prefix-maximal flow x2 for (p2 , T2 ), truncate it at TL , and remove all the jobs from this assignment that are counted in n2,1 H , that is, all jobs j such that x2 ij = 1, p2 ij = L, p1 ij = H. Denote this flow by x. Observe that x is a valid flow for (p1 , TL ), and the size of this flow is exactly np2,T 2 |T L −n2,1 H = np2,T L −n2,1 H . Also none of the jobs that are counted in n2,1 L are assigned by x since each such job j is high on i in p2 . Since T1 > TL , we must have np1,T L < npL,T L . So if we augment x to a max-flow for (p1 , TL ), then by Lemma 5.8 (with p = pL and p = p1 ), all the jobs corresponding to n2,1 L must be assigned in this max-flow. Thus, the size of this max-flow is at least (size of x) + n2,1 L , that is, np1,T L ≥ np2,T L − n2,1 H + n2,1 L , as claimed. Lemma 5.11 Suppose T∗ (p1 ) = TL . Then (7) holds. Proof. Again let T1 = T∗ (p1 ) = TL and T2 = T∗ (p2 ). Let x1 , x2 be the complete assignment, i.e., the assignment after both steps 2 and 3, computed by our algorithm for p1 , p2 respectively. Let S = {j : x2 ij = 1 and p2 ij = L} and S = {j : x2 ij = 1 and p1 ij = L}. Therefore, |S | = |S| − n2,1 H + n2,1 L and |S| = ni p2,T 2 = ni p2,T 2 |T L (by Corollary 5.9). Let T = |S | · L. We consider two cases. Suppose first that T ≤ TL . Consider the following flow for (p1 , TL ): assign to every machine other than i the lowassignment of x2 truncated at TL , and assign the jobs in S to machine i. This is a valid flow for (p1 , TL ) since the load on i is T ≤ TL . Its size is equal to P i =i ni p2,T 2 |T L +|S | = np2,T 2 |T L −n2,1 H +n2,1 L = np2,T L −n2,1 H +n2,1 L . The size of the max-flow for (p1 , TL ) is no smaller, and the claim follows. 259 Now suppose T > TL . Since |S| · L ≤ TL (by Corollary 5.9), it follows that n2,1 L > n2,1 H ≥ 0. Let ˆT = T − L ≥ TL since T , TL are both multiples of L. Let M = np2,T 2 − n2,1 H + n2,1 L = |S | + P i =i ni p2,T 2 . We first show that m · ˆT < M · L + (n − M) · H. (8) Let N be the number of jobs assigned to machine i in x2 . The load on machine i is |S|·L+(N −|S|)·H ≥ |S |·L−n2,1 L · L+(N−|S|)·H which is at least |S |·L > ˆT since n2,1 L ≤ N− |S|. Thus we get the inequality |S |·L+(N −|S |)·H > ˆT. Now consider the point in the execution of the algorithm on instance p2 just before the last high job is assigned to i in Step 3 (there must be such a job since n2,1 L > 0). The load on i at this point is |S| · L + (N − |S| − 1) · H which is least |S | · L − L = ˆT by a similar argument as above. By the greedy property, every i = i also has at least this load at this point, so P j p2 i jx2 i j ≥ ˆT. Adding these inequalities for all i = i, and the earlier inequality for i, we get that |S | · L + (N − |S |) · H + P i =i P j p2 i jx2 i j > m ˆT. But the left-hand-side is exactly M · L + (n − M) · H. On the other hand, since T1 = TL , we have m · ˆT ≥ m · TL ≥ np1,T L · L + (n − np1,T L ) · H. (9) Combining (8) and (9), we get that np1,T L > M = np2,T 2 − n2,1 H + n2,1 L ≥ np2,T L − n2,1 H + n2,1 L . Lemma 5.12 Algorithm 2 satisfies cycle monotonicity. Proof. Taking p1 = pk and p2 = pk+1 in (7), we get that npk,T L ≥ npk+1,T L −nk+1,k H +nk+1,k L . Summing this over all k = 1, . . . , K (where K + 1 ≡ 1) yields (6). 5.3 Computation of prices Lemmas 5.7 and 5.12 show that our algorithm is a 2approximation algorithm that satisfies cycle monotonicity. Thus, by the discussion in Section 3, there exist prices that yield a truthful mechanism. To obtain a polynomial-time mechanism, we also need to show how to compute these prices (or payments) in polynomial-time. It is not clear, if the procedure outlined in Section 3 based on computing shortest paths in the allocation graph yields a polynomial time algorithm, since the allocation graph has an exponential number of nodes (one for each output assignment). Instead of analyzing the allocation graph, we will leverage our proof of cycle monotonicity, in particular, inequality (7), and simply spell out the payments. Recall that the utility of a player is ui = Pi − li, where Pi is the payment made to player i. For convenience, we will first specify negative payments (i.e., the Pis will actually be prices charged to the players) and then show that these can be modified so that players have non-negative utilities (if they act truthfully). Let Hi denote the number of jobs assigned to machine i in step 3. By Corollary 5.6, we know that all these jobs are assigned to high machines (according to the declared pis). Let H−i = P i =i Hi and n−i p,T = P i =i ni p,T . The payment Pi to player i is defined as: Pi(p) = −L · n−i p,T ∗(p) − H · H−i (p) − (H − L) ` np,T ∗(p) − np,T L i (p−i) ´ (10) We can interpret our payments as equating the players cost to a careful modification of the total load (in the spirit of VCG prices). The first and second terms in (10), when subtracted from is load li equate is cost to the total load. The term np,T ∗(p) − np,T L i (p−i) is in fact equal to n−i p,T ∗(p) − n−i p,T ∗(p)|T L i (p−i) since the low-load on i is at most TL i (p−i) (by Claim 5.9). Thus the last term in equation (10) implies that we treat the low jobs that were assigned beyond the TL i (p−i) threshold (to machines other than i) effectively as high jobs for the total utility calculation from is point of view. It is not clear how one could have conjured up these payments a priori in order to prove the truthfulness of our algorithm. However, by relying on cycle monotonicity, we were not only able to argue the existence of payments, but also our proof paved the way for actually inferring these payments. The following lemma explicitly verifies that the payments defined above do indeed give a truthful mechanism. Lemma 5.13 Fix a player i and the other players declarations p−i. Let is true type be p1 i . Then, under the payments defined in (10), is utility when she declares her true type p1 i is at least her utility when she declares any other type p2 i . Proof. Let c1 i , c2 i denote is total cost, defined as the negative of her utility, when she declares p1 , and p2 , respectively (and the others declare p−i). Since p−i is fixed, we omit p−i from the expressions below for notational clarity. The true load of i when she declares her true type p1 i is L · ni p1,T ∗(p1) + H · Hi (p1 ), and therefore c1 i = L · np1,T ∗(p1) + H · (n − np1,T ∗(p1)) + (H − L) ` np1,T ∗(p1) − np1,T L i ´ = n · H − (H − L)np1,T L i (11) On the other hand, is true load when she declares p2 i is L · (ni p2,T ∗(p2) − n2,1 H + n2,1 L ) + H · (Hi + n2,1 H − n2,1 L ) (since is true processing time vector is p1 i ), and thus c2 i = n · H − (H − L)np2,T L i + (H − L)n2,1 H − (H − L)n2,1 L . Thus, (7) implies that c1 i ≤ c2 i . Price specifications are commonly required to satisfy, in addition to truthfulness, individual rationality, i.e., a players utility should be non-negative if she reveals her true value. The payments given by (10) are not individually rational as they actually charge a player a certain amount. However, it is well-known that this problem can be easily solved by adding a large-enough constant to the price definition. In our case, for example, letting H denote the vector of all Hs, we can add the term n·H −(H −L)n(H,p−i),T L i (p−i) to (10). Note that this is a constant for player i. Thus, the new payments are Pi (p) = n · H − L · n−i p,T ∗(p) − H · H−i (p) − (H −L) ` np,T ∗(p) −np,T L i (p−i) +n(H,p−i),T L i (p−i) ´ . As shown by (11), this will indeed result in a non-negative utility for i (since n(H,p−i),T L i (p−i) ≤ n(pi,p−i),T L i (p−i) for any type pi of player i). This modification also ensures the additionally desired normalization property that if a player receives no jobs then she receives zero payment: if player i receives the empty set for some type pi then she will also receive the empty set for the type H (this is easy to verify for our specific algorithm), and for the type H, her utility equals zero; thus, by truthfulness this must also be the utility of every other declaration that results in i receiving the empty set. This completes the proof of Theorem 5.3. 260 5.4 Impossibility of exact implementation We now show that irrespective of computational considerations, there does not exist a cycle-monotone algorithm for the L-H case with an approximation ratio better than 1.14. Let H = α·L for some 2 < α < 2.5 that we will choose later. There are two machines I, II and seven jobs. Consider the following two scenarios: Scenario 1. Every job has the same processing time on both machines: jobs 1-5, are L, and jobs 6, 7 are H. Any optimal schedule assigns jobs 1-5 to one machine and jobs 6, 7 to the other, and has makespan OPT1 = 5L. The secondbest schedule has makespan at least Second1 = 2H + L. Scenario 2. If the algorithm chooses an optimal schedule for scenario 1, assume without loss of generality that jobs 6, 7 are assigned to machine II. In scenario 2, machine I has the same processing-time vector. Machine II lowers jobs 6, 7 to L and increases 1-5 to H. An optimal schedule has makespan 2L + H, where machine II gets jobs 6, 7 and one of the jobs 1-5. The second-best schedule for this scenario has makespan at least Second2 = 5L. Theorem 5.14 No deterministic truthful mechanism for the two-value scheduling problem can obtain an approximation ratio better than 1.14. Proof. We first argue that a cycle-monotone algorithm cannot choose the optimal schedule in both scenarios. This follows because otherwise cycle monotonicity is violated for machine II. Taking p1 II , p2 II to be machine IIs processingtime vectors for scenarios 1, 2 respectively, we get P j(p1 II ,j − p2 II ,j)(x2 II ,j −x1 II ,j) = (L−H)(1−0) < 0. Thus, any truthful mechanism must return a sub-optimal makespan in at least one scenario, and therefore its approximation ratio is at least min ˘Second1 OPT1 , Second2 OPT2 ¯ ≥ 1.14 for α = 2.364. We remark that for the {Lj, Hj}-case where there is a common ratio r = Hj Lj for all jobs (this generalizes the restricted-machines setting) one can obtain a fractional truthful mechanism (with efficiently computable prices) that returns a schedule of makespan at most OPT(p) for every p. One can view each job j as consisting of Lj sub-jobs of size 1 on a machine i if pij = Lj, and size r if pij = Hj. For this new instance ˜p, note that ˜pij ∈ {1, r} for every i, j. Notice also that any assignment ˜x for the instance ˜p translates to a fractional assignment x for p, where pijxij =P j : sub-job of j ˜pij ˜xij . Thus, if we use Algorithm 2 to obtain a schedule for the instance ˜p, equation (6) translates precisely to (3) for the assignment x; moreover, the prices for ˜p translate to prices for the instance p. The number of sub-jobs assigned to low-machines in the flow-phase is simply the total work assigned to low-machines. Thus, we can implement the above reduction by setting up a max-flow problem that seems to maximize the total work assigned to low machines. Moreover, since we have a fractional domain, we can use a more efficient greedy rule for packing the unassigned portions of jobs and argue that the fractional assignment has makespan at most OPT(p). The assignment x need not however satisfy the condition that xij > 0 implies pij ≤ OPT(p) for arbitrary r, therefore, the rounding procedure of Lemma 4.2 does not yield a 2-approximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism. But if r > OPT(p) (as in the restricted-machines setting), this condition does hold, so we get a 2-approximation truthful mechanism.

Este es un dominio de programación multidimensional, y los únicos resultados positivos conocidos para la minimización de HACHEPAN en dicho dominio son los mecanismos veraz de O (M) de acroimentación [22, 20]. Estudiamos un caso especial bien motivado de este problema, donde el tiempo de procesamiento de un trabajo en cada máquina puede ser bajo o alto, y los valores bajos y altos dependen del trabajo y dependen del trabajo. Esto conserva la multidimensionalidad del dominio y generaliza la configuración de máquinas restringidas (es decir, {PJ, ∞}) en la programación. Le damos una técnica general para convertir cualquier algoritmo de acerca de C-APROMACIÓN a un mecanismo de 3CPROXATION VERDADA-IN-Expectation. Este es uno de los pocos resultados conocidos que muestra cómo exportar algoritmos de aproximación para un problema multidimensional en mecanismos veraces de manera negra. Cuando los valores bajos y altos son los mismos para todos los trabajos, diseñamos un mecanismo veraz de 2 de acerca determinista. Estos son los primeros mecanismos veraces con garantías de rendimiento no trivial para un dominio de programación multidimensional. Nuestras construcciones son novedosas en dos aspectos. Primero, no utilizamos ni confiamos en definiciones de precios explícitas para demostrar la veracidad;En cambio, diseñamos algoritmos que satisfacen la monotonicidad del ciclo. La monotonicidad del ciclo [23] es una condición necesaria y suficiente para la veracidad, es una generalización del valor monotonicidad para dominios multidimensionales. Sin embargo, mientras que el valor de la monotonicidad se ha utilizado amplia y con éxito para diseñar mecanismos veraces en dominios individuales, el nuestro es el primer trabajo que aprovecha la monotonicidad del ciclo en el entorno multidimensional. En segundo lugar, nuestros mecanismos aleatorios se obtienen construyendo primero un mecanismo veraz fraccional para una relajación fraccional del problema, y luego convertirlo en un mecanismo de expectación de la verdad. Esto se basa en una técnica de [16], y muestra la utilidad de los mecanismos fraccionales en el diseño del mecanismo veraz.

Introducción Mecanismo Diseño Estudios de construcciones algorítmicas bajo la presencia de jugadores estratégicos que contienen los aportes al algoritmo. El diseño del mecanismo algorítmico se ha centrado principalmente en los entornos que el planificador social o el diseñador desea maximizar el bienestar social (o de manera equivalente, minimizar el costo social), o en los entornos de subasta donde la rentabilidad es el objetivo principal. Los objetivos de optimización alternativos, como los que incorporan criterios de equidad (que se han investigado algorítmicamente y en la teoría de la elección social) han recibido muy poca o ninguna atención. En este artículo, consideramos un objetivo alternativo en el contexto de la programación de las máquinas, a saber, la minimización de la marca. Hay N trabajos o tareas que deben asignarse a Máquinas M, donde cada trabajo debe asignarse exactamente a una máquina. Asignando un trabajo j a una máquina I incurre en una carga (costo) de PIJ ≥ 0 en la máquina I, y la carga de una máquina es la suma de las cargas incurridas debido a los trabajos asignados a ella;El objetivo es programar los trabajos para minimizar la carga máxima de una máquina, que se denomina makepan del horario. La minimización de MakePan es un objetivo común en los entornos de programación, y se ha estudiado bien algorítmicamente tanto en las comunidades de investigación en ciencias de la computación y en las operaciones (ver, por ejemplo, la encuesta [12]). Después del trabajo de Nisan y Ronen [22], consideramos que cada máquina es un jugador o agente estratégico que conoce en privado su propio tiempo de procesamiento para cada trabajo, y puede tergiversar estos valores para disminuir su carga (que es su costo incurrido.). Por lo tanto, abordamos el problema a través del diseño del mecanismo: el diseñador social, que posee el conjunto de trabajos que se asignarán, debe especificar, además de un cronograma, pagos adecuados a los jugadores para incentivarlos para revelar sus verdaderos tiempos de procesamiento. Tal mecanismo se llama mecanismo veraz. El objetivo de la minimización de la marca es bastante diferente del objetivo clásico de la maximización del bienestar social, donde uno quiere maximizar el bienestar total (o minimizar el costo total) de todos los jugadores. En cambio, 252 corresponde a maximizar el bienestar mínimo y la noción de justicia máxima, y parece ser un problema mucho más difícil desde el punto de vista del diseño del mecanismo. En particular, la famosa familia de mecanismos VCG [26, 9, 10] no se aplica aquí, y necesitamos idear nuevas técnicas. La posibilidad de construir un mecanismo veraz para la minimización de Hacerpan está fuertemente relacionada con los supuestos en los tiempos de procesamiento de los jugadores, en particular, la dimensionalidad del dominio. Nisan y Ronen consideraron la configuración de máquinas no relacionadas donde los valores de PIJ pueden ser arbitrarios. Este es un dominio multidimensional, ya que un valor privado de los jugadores es todo su vector de tiempos de procesamiento (PIJ) j. Se conocen muy pocos resultados positivos para los dominios multidimensionales en general, y los únicos resultados positivos conocidos por la programación multidimensional son los mecanismos veraz de la acroimentación de O (M) [22, 20]. Hacemos hincapié en que, independientemente de las consideraciones computacionales, incluso la existencia de un mecanismo veraz con una relación de aproximación significativamente mejor (que m) no se conoce por dicho dominio de programación. En el lado negativo, [22] mostró que ningún mecanismo determinista veraz puede alcanzar una relación de aproximación mejor que 2, y fortaleció este inferior límite a M para dos clases específicas de mecanismos deterministas. Recientemente, [20] extendió este límite inferior a los mecanismos aleatorios, y [8] mejoró el límite inferior determinista. En marcado contraste con el estado de cosas anterior, los resultados positivos mucho más fuertes (y muchos más) son conocidos por un caso especial del problema de las máquinas no relacionadas, a saber, el entorno de máquinas relacionadas. Aquí, tenemos PIJ = PJ/Si para cada i, J, donde PJ es conocimiento público, y la velocidad Si es el único parámetro privado de la máquina i. Esta suposición hace que el dominio de los tipos de reproductores sea único dimensional. La veracidad en tales dominios es equivalente a una condición de monotonicidad del valor conveniente [21, 3], lo que parece hacer que sea significativamente más fácil diseñar mecanismos veraces en tales dominios. Archer y Tardos [3] consideraron por primera vez la configuración de máquinas relacionadas y dieron un mecanismo aleatorizado de 3 de la promulgación de 3 de accesorios. La brecha entre los dominios de una sola dimensión y multidimensional es quizás mejor ejemplificada por el hecho de que [3] demostró que existe un mecanismo veraz que siempre genera un horario óptimo.(Recuerde que en el entorno de máquinas no relacionadas multidimensionales, es imposible obtener un mecanismo veraz con una relación de aproximación mejor que 2.) Varios resultados de seguimiento [2, 4, 1, 13] han fortalecido la noción de veracidad y/o han mejorado la relación de aproximación. Tales dificultades para pasar de la configuración de una sola dimensión a la multidimensional también surgen en otras configuraciones de diseño del mecanismo (por ejemplo, subastas combinatorias). Por lo tanto, además de la importancia específica de la programación en entornos estratégicos, las ideas de la programación multidimensional también pueden influir en el contexto más general del diseño del mecanismo veraz para los dominios multidimensionales. En este documento, consideramos el problema de la minimización MakePan para un caso especial de máquinas no relacionadas, donde el tiempo de procesamiento de un trabajo es bajo o alto en cada máquina. Más precisamente, en nuestro entorno, pij ∈ {lj, hj} para cada i, j, donde los valores de LJ, Hj se conocen públicamente (LJ ≡Low, Hj ≡High). Llamamos a este modelo el caso de dos valores dependiente del trabajo. Este modelo generaliza la configuración clásica de máquinas restringidas, donde Pij ∈ {lj, ∞} que ha sido bien estudiada algorítmicamente. Un caso especial de nuestro modelo es cuando LJ = L y Hj = H para todos los trabajos J, que denotamos simplemente como el modelo de programación de dos valores. Ambos dominios son multidimensionales, ya que las máquinas no están relacionadas: un trabajo puede ser bajo en una máquina y en lo alto de la otra, mientras que otro trabajo puede seguir el patrón opuesto. Por lo tanto, la información privada de cada máquina es un vector que especifica qué trabajos son bajos y altos en ella. Por lo tanto, conservan la propiedad central subyacente a la dureza del diseño del mecanismo veraz para máquinas no relacionadas, y al estudiar estas configuraciones especiales esperamos obtener algunas ideas que serán útiles para abordar el problema general. Nuestros resultados y técnicas presentamos varios resultados positivos para nuestros dominios de programación multidimensionales. Nuestro primer resultado es un método general para convertir un algoritmo de aproximación para el establecimiento de dos valores dependientes del trabajo en un mecanismo de apropiación de 3C. Este es uno de los pocos resultados conocidos que usan un algoritmo de aproximación de manera negra para obtener un mecanismo veraz para un problema multidimensional. Nuestro resultado implica que existe un mecanismo de expectación de la verdad de 3 de acerca para el entorno LJ-HJ. Curiosamente, la prueba de veracidad no se basa en el suministro de precios explícitos, y nuestra construcción no produce necesariamente precios eficientemente computables (pero la regla de asignación es eficientemente computable). Nuestro segundo resultado se aplica a la configuración de TwoValues (LJ = L, Hj = H), para lo cual mejoramos tanto la relación de aproximación como fortalecemos la noción de veracidad. Obtuvimos un mecanismo veraz de 2-Apromentación determinista (junto con los precios) para este problema. Estos son los primeros mecanismos veraces con garantías de rendimiento no trivial para un dominio de programación multidimensional. Complementando esto, observamos que incluso esta configuración aparentemente simple no admite mecanismos veraces que devuelven un horario óptimo (a diferencia del caso de las máquinas relacionadas). Al explotar la multidimensionalidad del dominio, demostramos que ningún mecanismo determinista veraz puede obtener una relación de aproximación mejor que 1.14 a la marca (independientemente de las consideraciones computacionales). La técnica principal, y una de las novedades, subyacentes a nuestras construcciones y pruebas, es que no confiamos en especificaciones de precios explícitas para demostrar la veracidad de nuestros mecanismos. En su lugar, explotamos ciertas condiciones de monotonicidad algorítmica que caracterizan la veracidad para diseñar primero un algoritmo implementable, es decir, un algoritmo para el cual los precios garantizan la veracidad, y luego encontrar estos precios (al profundizar aún más en la prueba de implementación). Este tipo de análisis ha sido el método de elección en el diseño de mecanismos veraces para los dominios individuales, donde la monotonicidad del valor produce una caracterización conveniente que permite concentrarse en el lado algorítmico del problema (ver, por ejemplo, [3, 7, 4, 1, 13]). Pero para los dominios multidimensionales, casi todos los resultados positivos se han basado en especificaciones de precios explícitas para demostrar la veracidad (una excepción es el trabajo de jugadores desconocidos en subastas combinatorias [17, 7]), un hecho que una vez más muestra la brechaEn nuestra comprensión de dominios multidimensionales versus unicamensionales. Nuestro trabajo es el primero en aprovechar las condiciones de monotonicidad para el diseño del mecanismo veraz en dominios arbitrarios. La condición de monotonicidad que usamos, que a veces se llama monotonicidad del ciclo, fue propuesta por primera vez por Rochet [23] (ver también [11]). Es una generalización de la monotonicidad del valor y caracteriza completamente la veracidad en cada dominio. Nuestros métodos y análisis demuestran los beneficios potenciales 253 de esta caracterización, y muestran que la monotonicidad del ciclo puede utilizarse de manera efectiva para diseñar mecanismos veraces para dominios multidimensionales. Considere, por ejemplo, nuestro primer resultado que demuestre que cualquier algoritmo de acerca de C-C-APROMACIÓN se puede exportar a un mecanismo de apertura de 3C. Al nivel de generalidad de un algoritmo de aproximación arbitraria, parece poco probable que uno pueda obtener precios para demostrar la veracidad del mecanismo construido. Pero, la monotonicidad del ciclo nos permite probar tal declaración. De hecho, alguna de estas condiciones basadas solo en el algoritmo subyacente (y no en los precios) parece necesaria para demostrar una declaración tan general. El método para convertir los algoritmos de aproximación en mecanismos veraces implica otra idea novedosa. Nuestro mecanismo aleatorizado se obtiene construyendo primero un mecanismo veraz que devuelve un horario fraccional. Pasar a un dominio fraccional nos permite enchufar la veracidad en el algoritmo de aproximación de una manera bastante simple, al tiempo que perdemos un factor de 2 en la relación de aproximación. Luego usamos un procedimiento de redondeo aleatorio adecuado para convertir la asignación fraccional en una asignación integral aleatoria. Para esto, utilizamos un procedimiento de redondeo reciente de Kumar et al.[14] que se adapta a la programación de máquinas no relacionadas. Esto conserva la veracidad, pero perdemos otro factor aditivo igual a la relación de aproximación. Nuestra construcción usa y extiende algunas observaciones de Lavi y Swamy [16], y demuestra aún más los beneficios de los mecanismos fraccionales en el diseño del mecanismo sincero. El trabajo relacionado Nisan y Ronen [22] consideraron por primera vez el problema de la minimización de la marca para máquinas no relacionadas. Dieron un resultado positivo de la Acroximación M y demostraron varios límites inferiores. Recientemente, Mualem y Schapira [20] demostraron un límite inferior de 2 en la relación de aproximación que se puede lograr con mecanismos veraces en expectación, y Christodoulou, Koutsoupias y Vidali [8] demostró un (1 + √ 2) con destino a la deterministaLos mecanismos veraces. Archer y Tardos [3] consideraron primero el problema de las máquinas relacionadas y dieron un mecanismo de 3-APROMACIÓN AUTERITLE-in-Expectation. Esto se ha mejorado en [2, 4, 1, 13] a: un mecanismo aleatorizado de 2 de la acercamiento [2];Un FPTA para cualquier número fijo de máquinas dadas por Andelman, Azar y Sorani [1], y un mecanismo determinista de 3 de la acerca de Kov´ACS [13]. El problema algorítmico (es decir, sin requerir la veracidad) de la minimización de la marca en máquinas no relacionadas se entiende bien y se conocen varios algoritmos de 2 de acrochación de 2. Lenstra, Shmoys y Tardos [18] dieron el primer algoritmo de este tipo. Shmoys y Tardos [25] más tarde dieron un algoritmo de 2 apropiación para el problema de asignación generalizada, una generalización donde hay un CIJ de costo por asignar un trabajo J a una máquina I, y el objetivo es minimizar el costo sujeto a un límite en el Makepan. Recientemente, Kumar, Marathe, Parthasarathy y Srinivasan [14] dieron un algoritmo de redondeo aleatorio que produce los mismos límites. Utilizamos su procedimiento en nuestro mecanismo aleatorizado. Rochet [23] (ver también Gui et al. [11]). Esto generaliza la condición de monotonicidad del valor para los dominios de una sola dimensión que fue dada por Myerson [21] y redescubierta por [3]. Como se mencionó anteriormente, esta condición se ha explotado en numerosas ocasiones para obtener mecanismos veraz para dominios de una sola dimensión [3, 7, 4, 1, 13]. Para los dominios convexos (es decir, cada conjunto de valores privados es convexo), se sabe que la monotonicidad del ciclo está implícita en una condición más simple, llamada monotonicidad débil [15, 6, 24]. Pero incluso esta condición más simple no ha encontrado mucha aplicación en el diseño del mecanismo veraz para problemas multidimensionales. Los objetivos distintos de la maximización del bienestar social y la maximización de los ingresos han recibido muy poca atención en el diseño del mecanismo. En el contexto de las subastas combinatorias, los problemas de maximizar el valor mínimo recibido por un jugador y calcular una asignación de minimización de envidia se han estudiado brevemente. Lavi, Mualem y Nisan [15] mostraron que el objetivo anterior no se puede implementar con sinceridad;Bezakova y Dani [5] dieron un mecanismo de 0.5-acroximación para dos jugadores con valoraciones aditivas. Lipton et al.[19] mostró que el último objetivo no se puede implementar con sinceridad. Estos límites inferiores se fortalecieron en [20].2. Preliminares 2.1 El dominio de programación En nuestro problema de programación, se nos da a n trabajos y máquinas M, y cada trabajo debe asignarse exactamente a una máquina. En la configuración de máquinas no relacionadas, cada máquina I se caracteriza por un vector de tiempos de procesamiento (PIJ) J, donde PIJ ∈ R≥0 ∪ {∞} denota es el tiempo de procesamiento para el trabajo J con el valor ∞ que especifica que no puedo procesar J. Consideramos dos casos especiales de este problema: 1. El caso de dos valores dependiente del trabajo, donde se conocen pij ∈ {lj, hj} para cada i, j, con lj ≤ hj, y los valores lj, hj son conocidos. Esto generaliza el modelo de programación clásico de máquinas restringidas, donde HJ = ∞.2. El caso de dos valores, que es un caso especial de arriba donde lj = ly hj = h para todos los trabajos j, es decir, pij ∈ {l, h} para cada i, j. Decimos que un trabajo j es bajo en la máquina i si pij = lj y alto si pij = hj. Usaremos el cronograma de los términos y la asignación indistintamente. Representamos un horario determinista por un vector x = (xij) i, j, donde xij es 1 si el trabajo j se asigna a la máquina I, por lo tanto, tenemos xij ∈ {0, 1} por cada i, j, p i xij =1 para cada trabajo j. También consideraremos algoritmos y algoritmos aleatorios que devuelven una asignación fraccional. En ambas configuraciones, volveremos a especificar una asignación de un vector x = (xij) i, j con p j xij = 1, pero ahora xij ∈ [0, 1] para cada i, j. Para un algoritmo aleatorizado, XIJ es simplemente la probabilidad de que J se asigne a I (por lo tanto, X es una combinación convexa de asignaciones enteras). Denotamos la carga de la máquina I (bajo una asignación dada) por Li = P J Xijpij, y el creador de un horario se define como la carga máxima en cualquier máquina, es decir, Maxi Li. El objetivo en el problema de la minimización de Makepan es asignar los trabajos a las máquinas para minimizar el creador del horario.2.2 Diseño del mecanismo Consideramos el problema de la minimización de la marca en los dominios de programación anteriores en el contexto del diseño del mecanismo. Mecanismo Diseño de estudios de estudios estratégicos donde el diseñador social necesita garantizar la cooperación de las diferentes entidades involucradas en el procedimiento algorítmico. Tras el trabajo de Nisan y Ronen [22], consideramos que las máquinas son los jugadores estratégicos o agentes. El diseñador social posee el conjunto de trabajos que deben asignarse, pero no conoce los tiempos de procesamiento (verdaderos) de estos trabajos en las diferentes máquinas. Cada máquina es una entidad egoísta, que en privado conoce su propio tiempo de procesamiento para cada trabajo.En una máquina incurre en un costo para la máquina igual al verdadero tiempo de procesamiento del trabajo en la máquina, y una máquina puede optar por tergiversar su vector de tiempos de procesamiento, que son privados, para disminuir su costo. Consideramos los mecanismos de revelación directa: cada máquina informa su vector (posiblemente falso) de los tiempos de procesamiento, el mecanismo calcula un horario y entrega los pagos a los jugadores (es decir, máquinas) para compensarlos por el costo en el que incurren en el procesamiento de su asignado sus asignadostrabajos. Un mecanismo (de revelación directa) consiste así en una tupla (x, p): x especifica el cronograma, y p = {pi} especifica los pagos entregados a las máquinas, donde tanto X como el PI son funciones del procesamiento informadoTimes P = (PIJ) I, J. El objetivo de los mecanismos es calcular un cronograma que tenga un creador casi óptimo con respecto a los verdaderos tiempos de procesamiento;Sin embargo, una máquina I solo está interesada en maximizar su propia utilidad, PI - Li, donde Li es su carga bajo la asignación de salida y puede declarar tiempos de procesamiento falsos si esto podría aumentar su utilidad. Por lo tanto, el mecanismo debe incentivar a las máquinas/jugadores para que revelen sinceramente sus tiempos de procesamiento a través de los pagos. Esto se hace preciso utilizando la noción de veracidad de estrategia dominante. Definición 2.1 (veracidad) Un mecanismo de programación es veraz si, para cada máquina, cada vector de tiempos de procesamiento de las otras máquinas, P-I, cada verdadero vector de procesamiento P1 I y cualquier otro vector P2 I de la máquina I, nosotros, nosotros, nosotros, nosotros, nosotros, nosotros,tener: p1 i - x j x1 ijp1 ij ≥ p2 i - x j x2 ijp1 ij, (1) donde (x1, p1) y (x2, p2) son respectivamente el horario y los pagos cuando las otras máquinas declaran p - i yLa máquina I declara p1 I y P2 I, es decir, x1 = x (p1 i, p - i), p1 i = pi (p1 i, p - i) y x2 = x (p2 i, p - i), p2 i= PI (P2 I, P - I). Para decirlo en palabras, en un mecanismo veraz, ninguna máquina puede mejorar su utilidad al declarar un tiempo de procesamiento falso, sin importar lo que declaren las otras máquinas. También consideraremos mecanismos fraccionales que devuelven una asignación fraccional y mecanismos aleatorios que se les permite arrojar monedas y donde la asignación y los pagos pueden ser variables aleatorias. La noción de veracidad para un mecanismo fraccional es la misma que en la definición 2.1, donde x1, x2 ahora son tareas fraccionales. Para un mecanismo aleatorizado, consideraremos la noción de veracidad en la expectativa [3], lo que significa que una máquina (jugador) maximiza su utilidad esperada al declarar su verdadero vector de tiempo de procesamiento. La desigualdad (1) también define la veracidad en la excepción para un mecanismo aleatorizado, donde P1 I, P2 ahora denota los pagos esperados realizados al Jugador I, X1, X2 son las tareas fraccionadas que denotan el cronograma de algoritmos aleatorios (es decir, XK IJ IS IS ISLa probabilidad de que J se asigne a I en la salida del cronograma para (PK I, P - I)). Para nuestros dos dominios de programación, la suposición informativa es que los valores LJ, HJ son conocidos públicamente. La información privada de una máquina es qué trabajos tienen valor LJ (o L) y cuáles tienen valor HJ (o H) en ella. Hacemos hincapié en que ambos dominios son multidimensionales, ya que cada máquina que necesito especificar un vector que dice qué trabajos son bajos y altos.3. Monotonicidad del ciclo Aunque la veracidad se define en términos de pagos, resulta que la veracidad en realidad se reduce a una cierta condición algorítmica de la monotonicidad. Esto parece haber sido observado por primera vez para los dominios multidimensionales por Rochet [23] en 1987, y se ha utilizado con éxito en el diseño del mecanismo algorítmico varias veces, pero para dominios individuales. Sin embargo, para los dominios multidimensionales, la condición de monotonicidad está más involucrada y no ha habido éxito en emplearla en el diseño de mecanismos veraces. La mayoría de los resultados positivos para los dominios multidimensionales se han basado en especificaciones de precios explícitas para demostrar la veracidad. Una de las principales contribuciones de este documento es demostrar que la condición de monotonicidad para entornos multidimensionales, que a veces se llama monotonicidad del ciclo, puede utilizarse de manera efectiva para idear mecanismos veraces. Incluimos una breve exposición al completarlo. La exposición aquí se basa en gran medida en [11]. La monotonicidad del ciclo se describe mejor en la configuración de elección social abstracta: hay un conjunto finito A de alternativas, hay m reproductores y cada jugador tiene un tipo privado (función de valoración) v: a → r, donde vi (a) debe serinterpretado como es valor para la alternativa a. En el dominio de programación, A representa todas las tareas posibles de trabajos a las máquinas, y VI (a) es la carga negativa de IS en el Anexo a. Deje que VI denote el conjunto de todos los tipos posibles de jugador i. Un mecanismo es una tupla (F, {Pi}) donde F: V1 × · · · × VM → A es el algoritmo para elegir la alternativa, y PI: V1 × · · · × VM → A es el precio cobrado al jugador de reproductorYo (en el entorno de programación, el mecanismo paga a los jugadores, lo que corresponde a los precios negativos). El mecanismo es sincero si cada i, cada v - i ∈ V - i = q i = i vi, y cualquier vi, vi ∈ Vi tenemos vi (a) - pi (vi, v - i) ≥ vi (b (b) - PI (VI, V - I), donde a = F (VI, V - I) y B = F (VI, V - I). Una pregunta básica que surge se da un algoritmo F: V1 × · · · × VM → A, ¿existen precios que harán que el mecanismo resultante sea sincero? Es bien sabido (ver, por ejemplo, [15]) que el precio Pi solo puede depender de la alternativa elegida y las declaraciones de las demás, es decir, podemos escribir PI: V - I × A → R. Por lo tanto, la veracidad implica que para cada uno para cada uno.i, cada v - i ∈ V - i, y cualquier vi, vi ∈ Vi con f (vi, v - i) = a y f (vi, v - i) = b, tenemos vi (a) - pi (A, V - I) ≥ Vi (B) - PI (B, V - I). Ahora arregle un jugador I y arregle las declaraciones v - i de las otras. Buscamos una asignación a las variables {pa} a∈A tal que vi (a) - vi (b) ≥ pa - pb por cada a, b ∈ A y vi ∈ Vi con f (vi, v - i) = a.(Estrictamente hablando, deberíamos usar a = f (vi, v - i) en lugar de un aquí). Define ΔA, B: = inf {vi (a) - vi (b): vi ∈ Vi, f (vi, v - i) = a}. Ahora podemos reformular el problema de asignación de precios anterior: buscamos una asignación a las variables {pa} a∈A tal que pa-pb ≤ Δa, b ∀a, b ∈ A (2) esto se resuelve fácilmente mirando elGráfico de asignación y aplicando un resultado básico estándar de la teoría de gráficos. Definición 3.1 (Gui et al. [11]) El gráfico de asignación de F es un gráfico ponderado dirigido g = (a, e) donde e = a × a y el peso de un borde b → a (para cualquier a, b ∈A) es ΔA, b. Teorema 3.2 Existe una asignación factible a (2) si el gráfico de asignación no tiene ciclos de longitud negativa. Además, si todos los ciclos no son negativos, una asignación factible se obtiene 255 de la siguiente manera: corrige un nodo arbitrario a ∗ ∈ A y establece que PA sea la longitud de la ruta más corta de A ∗ a a. Esto lleva a la siguiente definición, que es otra forma de redactar la condición de que el gráfico de asignación no tenga ciclos negativos. Definición 3.3 (monotonicidad del ciclo) Una función de elección social f satisface la monotonicidad del ciclo si para cada jugador i, cada v - i ∈ V - i, cada entero k k y cada v1 i ,..., vk i ∈ Vi, kx k = 1 h vk i (ak) - vk i (ak+1) i ≥ 0 donde ak = f (vk i, v - i) para 1 ≤ k ≤ k y ak+1= A1. Corolario 3.4 Existen precios P de tal manera que el mecanismo (F, P) es sincero si Satisface la monotonicidad del ciclo.1 Ahora consideramos nuestro dominio de programación específico. Arregle un jugador I, P - I y cualquier P1 I ,..., PK i. Sea x (pk i, p - i) = xk para 1 ≤ k ≤ k, y deje xk+1 = x1, pk+1 = p1.XK podría ser una asignación {0, 1} o una asignación fraccional. Tenemos vk i (xk) = - p j xk ijpk ij, por lo que la monotonicidad del ciclo se traduce en pk k = 1 ˆ - p j xk ijpk ij + p j xk + 1 ij pk ij ˜ ≥ 0. Reorganizando, obtenemos kx k = 1 x j xk+1 ij `pk ij - pk+1 ij ´ ≥ 0. (3) Así (3) reduce nuestro problema de diseño de mecanismo a un problema algorítmico de concreto. Para la mayor parte de este documento, en consecuencia ignoraremos cualquier consideración estratégica y nos centraremos en diseñar un algoritmo de aproximación para minimizar MakePan que satisface (3).4. Una técnica general para obtener mecanismos aleatorios en esta sección, consideramos el caso de los valores de LJ, HJ dependientes del trabajo (con LJ ≤ Hj), que generaliza el modelo clásico de máquinas restringidas (donde HJ = ∞). Mostramos el poder de la aleatorización, al proporcionar una técnica general que convierte cualquier algoritmo de abroximación C en un mecanismo de apropiación 3C, sincera en la expectación. Este es uno de los pocos resultados que muestra cómo exportar algoritmos de aproximación para un problema multidimensional en mecanismos veraces cuando el algoritmo se da como una caja negra. Nuestra construcción y prueba son simples y se basan en dos ideas. Primero, como se describió anteriormente, demostramos la veracidad utilizando la monotonicidad del ciclo. Parece poco probable que para un algoritmo de aproximación arbitraria dado solo como una caja negra, uno podría encontrar pagos para demostrar la veracidad;Pero la monotonicidad del ciclo nos permite probar con precisión esto. En segundo lugar, obtenemos nuestro mecanismo aleatorizado (a) moviéndose primero a un dominio fraccional, y construyendo un mecanismo veraz fraccional que puede devolver asignaciones fraccionales;Luego (b) utilizando un procedimiento de redondeo para expresar el horario fraccional como una combinación convexa de horarios enteros. Esto se basa en un tema introducido por Lavi y Swamy [16], a saber, el de usar mecanismos fraccionados para obtener mecanismos veraces de expectación.1 No está claro si el teorema 3.2, y por lo tanto, esta declaración, mantén si A no es finito. Sin embargo, debemos señalar que uno no puede simplemente conectar los resultados de [16]. Sus resultados son válidos para los problemas sociales deximización y confían en usar VCG para obtener un mecanismo veraz fraccional. Sin embargo, VCG no se aplica a la minimización de HAKEPAN, y en nuestro caso, incluso la existencia de un mecanismo veraz fraccional casi óptimo se desconoce. Usamos el siguiente resultado adaptado de [16]. Lema 4.1 (Lavi y Swamy [16]) Sea M = (x, p) un mecanismo veraz fraccional. Sea A un algoritmo de redondeo aleatorio que dio una asignación fraccional x, emite una asignación aleatoria x tal que e ˆ xij ˜ = xij para todos los i, j. Luego existen pagos p de tal manera que el mecanismo M = (a, p) es sincero en las expectativas. Además, si M es individualmente racional, entonces M es individualmente racional para cada realización de los lanzamientos de monedas. Deje OPT (P) denotar el Makepan óptimo (sobre los horarios enteros), por ejemplo, p.Como nuestro primer paso, tomamos un algoritmo de capproximación y lo convertimos en un mecanismo veraz fraccional de 2C. Esta conversión funciona incluso cuando el algoritmo de aproximación devuelve solo un horario fraccional (que satisface ciertas propiedades) de MakePan como máximo c · opt (p) para cada caso p.Probamos la veracidad al mostrar que el algoritmo fraccional satisface la monotonicidad del ciclo (3). Observe que el conjunto alternativo de nuestro mecanismo fraccional es finito (aunque el conjunto de todas las asignaciones fraccionales es infinita): su cardinalidad es como máximo la de InputDomain, que es como máximo 2 mn en el caso de dos valores. Por lo tanto, podemos aplicar el Corolario 3.4 aquí. Para convertir este mecanismo veraz fraccional en un mecanismo veraz aleatorizado, necesitamos un procedimiento de redondeo aleatorizado que satisfaga los requisitos del Lema 4.1. Afortunadamente, tal procedimiento ya está proporcionado por Kumar, Marathe, Parthasarathy y Srinivasan [14]. Lemma 4.2 (Kumar et al. [14]) Dada una asignación fraccional x y un vector de tiempo de procesamiento P, existe un procedimiento de redondeo aleatorizado que produce una asignación (aleatoria) x tal que, 1. para cualquier i, j, e ˆXij ˜ = xij.2. Para cualquier I, P J xijpij <p j xijpij + max {j: xij ∈ (0,1)} PIJ con probabilidad 1. La propiedad 1 se utilizará para obtener la veracidad en la expectativa, y la propiedad 2 nos permitirá probar una garantía de aproximación. Primero mostramos que cualquier algoritmo que devuelva una asignación fraccional que tenga ciertas propiedades satisface la monotonicidad del ciclo. Lemma 4.3 Sea A un algoritmo que para cualquier entrada P, emite una asignación (fraccional) x tal que, si pij = hj entonces xij ≤ 1/m, y si Pij = lj entonces xij ≥ 1/m. Entonces un ciclo de ciclo satisface. Prueba. Arregle un jugador I y el vector de los tiempos de procesamiento de los otros jugadores P - I. Necesitamos probar (3), es decir, PK K = 1 P J XK+1 IJ `PK IJ - PK+1 IJ ´ ≥ 0 por cada P1 I ,..., Pk I, donde el índice K = K + 1 se considera K = 1. Mostraremos que para cada trabajo j, pk k = 1 xk+1 ij `pk ij - pk+1 ij ´ ≥ 0. Si PK IJ es lo mismo para todos los k (siempre LJ o siempre HJ), entonces la desigualdad anterior es claramente válida. De lo contrario, podemos dividir los índices 1 ,..., K, en segmentos máximos, donde un segmento máximo es un conjunto máximo de índices consecutivos K, K + 1 ,..., k - 1, k (donde k + 1 ≡ 1) tal que pk ij = hj ≥ pk +1 ij ≥ · · · ≥ pk ij = lj. Esto sigue porque debe haber algunos k tal que pk ij = hj> pk - 1 ij = lj. Tomamos k = k y luego seguimos incluidos los índices en este segmento hasta que llegamos a un k tal que PK ij = lj y pk+1 ij = hj. Establecimos k = k, y luego comenzamos un nuevo segmento máximo con el índice K + 1. Tenga en cuenta que K = K y K + 1 = K - 1. Ahora tenemos un subconjunto de índices y podemos continuar de manera recursiva. Entonces, todos los índices se incluyen en algún segmento máximo. Mostraremos que por cada segmento máximo K, K +1 ,..., k, p k −1≤k <k xk+1 ij `pk ij - pk+1 ij ´ ≥ 0. Agregar esto para cada segmento produce la desigualdad deseada. Así que ahora concéntrese en un segmento máximo K, K + 1 ,..., k - 1, k. Por lo tanto, hay algunos k ∗ tal que para k ≤ k <k ∗, tenemos pk ij = hj, y para k ∗ ≤ k ≤ k, tenemos pk ij = lj. Ahora el lado izquierdo de la desigualdad anterior para este segmento es simplemente xk ij (lj −hj)+xk ∗ ij (hj −lj) ≥ 0, ya que xk ij ≤ 1 m ≤ xk ∗ ij como pk ij = hj y pk∗ ij = lj. Ahora describimos cómo usar un algoritmo de acerca de C-C-APROBACIÓN para obtener un algoritmo que satisfaga la propiedad en Lemma 4.3. Para simplificar, primero suponga que el algoritmo de aproximación devuelve un horario integral. La idea es simplemente difundir este horario. Tomamos cada trabajo j asignado a una máquina alta y la asignamos hasta un punto 1/m en todas las máquinas;Para cada trabajo J asignado a una máquina baja, digamos I, asignamos 1/M-fracción a las otras máquinas donde es baja, y asigna su fracción restante (que es al menos 1/m) a i. La asignación resultante satisface claramente las propiedades deseadas. También observe que la carga en cualquier máquina ha aumentado en lo máximo de 1 m · (carga en otras máquinas) ≤ MakePan, y por lo tanto, el Makepan se ha duplicado como máximo. Esta extensión también se puede hacer si el horario inicial es fraccional. Ahora describimos el algoritmo con precisión. Algoritmo 1 Sea A cualquier algoritmo que en cualquier entrada P salga una asignación posiblemente fraccional x tal que xij> 0 implica que Pij ≤ t, donde t es la marca de x.(En particular, tenga en cuenta que cualquier algoritmo que devuelva una asignación integral tiene estas propiedades). Nuestro algoritmo, que llamamos a, devuelve la siguiente tarea xf. Inicializar xf ij = 0 para todo i, j. Para cada i, j, 1. Si pij = hj, establece xf ij = p i: pi j = hj xi j/m;2. Si pij = lj, establece xf ij = xij + p i = i: pi j = lj (xi j −xij)/m + p i: pi j = hj xi j/m. Teorema 4.4 Suponga que el algoritmo A satisface las condiciones en el algoritmo 1 y devuelve una marca de como máximo c · opt (p) por cada p.Luego, el algoritmo A construido anteriormente es un algoritmo fraccional de monótonos de 2c sobre ciclo. Además, si xf ij> 0 en la entrada p, entonces Pij ≤ c · opt (p). Prueba. Primero, tenga en cuenta que XF es una tarea válida: para cada trabajo J, P i xf ij = p i xij + p i, i = i: pij = pi j = lj (xi j - xij)/m = p i xij =1. También tenemos eso si PIJ = Hj entonces xf ij = p i: pi j = hj xi j/m ≤ 1/m. Si pij = lj, entonces xf ij = xij (1 - /m) + p i = i xi j /m where = | {i = i: pi j = lj} |≤ m - 1;entonces xf ij ≥ p i xi j/m ≥ 1/m. Por lo tanto, por Lema 4.3, A satisface la monotonicidad del ciclo. La carga total en cualquier máquina I bajo XF es en Mostp J: PIJ = Hj P I: Pi J = Hj HJ · XI J M + P J: PIJ = LJ LJ `XIJ + P I = I XI J M ´, que es como máximoP J PIJXIJ + P I = I P J PI JXI J/M ≤ 2C · OPT (P). Finalmente, si xf ij> 0 y pij = lj, entonces pij ≤ opt (p). Si pij = hj, entonces para algunos i (posiblemente i) con pi j = hj tenemos xi j> 0, por lo que por suposición, pi j = hj = pij ≤ c · opt (p). Teorema 4.4 Combinado con Lemmas 4.1 y 4.2, ofrece un mecanismo 3C de abarrosión, veraz en la expectación. El cálculo de los pagos dependerá del algoritmo de aproximación real utilizado. Sin embargo, la Sección 3 proporciona un procedimiento explícito para calcular los pagos que garantizan la veracidad, aunque quizás no en tiempo polinomial. Teorema 4.5 El procedimiento en el Algoritmo 1 convierte cualquier algoritmo fraccional de la Apreciación C en un mecanismo de apropiación 3C, veraz en la expectación. Tomando un algoritmo 1 para ser el algoritmo que devuelve una asignación de LP-Optimum que satisface las condiciones requeridas (ver [18, 25]), obtenemos un mecanismo de 3-APROMACIÓN. Corolario 4.6 Existe un mecanismo veraz en expectación con la relación de aproximación 3 para el entorno LJ-HJ.5. Un mecanismo determinista para el caso de dos valores ahora presentamos un mecanismo veraz de 2-acroximación determinista para el caso donde pij ∈ {l, h} para todo i, j. En la secuela, a menudo diremos que J se asigna a una baja máquina para denotar que J se asigna a una máquina I donde Pij = L. Llamaremos a un trabajo J un trabajo bajo de la máquina I if Pij = l;La baja carga de I es la carga en I debido a sus bajos trabajos, es decir, P J: PIJ = L xijpij. Como en la Sección 4, nuestro objetivo es obtener un algoritmo de aproximación que satisfaga la monotonicidad del ciclo. Primero obtenemos una simplificación de la condición (3) para nuestro dominio de programación de dos valores {L, H} (Proposición 5.1) que será conveniente para trabajar. Describimos nuestro algoritmo en la Sección 5.1. En la Sección 5.2, vinculamos su garantía de aproximación y demostramos que satisface la monotonicidad del ciclo. En la Sección 5.3, calculamos los pagos explícitos que dan un mecanismo veraz. Finalmente, en la Sección 5.4 mostramos que ningún mecanismo determinista puede lograr la marca óptima. Define nk, h = ˛ ˛ {j: xk ij = 1, pk ij = l, pij = h} ˛ ˛ (4) nk, l = ˛ ˛ {j: xk ij = 1, pk ij = h, pij =L} ˛ ˛.(5) Entonces, P J XK+1 IJ (PK IJ - PK+1 IJ) = (NK+1, K H - NK+1, K L) (H - L). Conectando esto en (3) y dividiendo por (H - L), obtenemos lo siguiente. La monotonicidad del ciclo de la Proposición 5.1 en el dominio de programación de dos valores es equivalente a la condición de que, para cada jugador I, cada P-I, cada entero K y cada P1 I ,..., Pk I, Kx K = 1 `nk+1, k h-nk+1, k l ´ ≥ 0. (6) 257 5.1 Algoritmo de aproximación de aciclo-monótono ahora describimos un algoritmo que satisface la condición (6) y logra A2-ACOMAXIMACIÓN. Asumiremos que L, H son enteros, que no tienen pérdida de generalidad. Un componente central de nuestro algoritmo será un procedimiento que toma un umbral de carga entero T y calcula una asignación parcial entera X de trabajos a máquinas de tal manera que (a) un trabajo solo se asigna a una máquina baja;(b) la carga en cualquier máquina es como máximo t;y (c) se maximiza el número de trabajos asignados. Dicha tarea se puede calcular resolviendo un problema de flujo máximo: construimos un gráfico bipartito dirigido con un nodo para cada trabajo j y cada máquina i, y un borde (j, i) de capacidad infinita si Pij = L. también nosotros tambiénAgregue un nodo de origen S con bordes (s, j) con capacidad 1 y nodo de sumisión T con bordes (i, t) con capacidad t/l. Claramente, cualquier flujo entero en esta red corresponde a una asignación parcial entera válida x de hacer hazmas en la mayoría de t, donde xij = 1 iff hay un flujo de 1 en el borde de j a i. Por lo tanto, usaremos la asignación de los términos y fluiremos indistintamente. Además, siempre hay un flujo máximo integral (ya que todas las capacidades son enteros). A menudo nos referiremos a un flujo máximo como el flujo máximo para (P, T). Necesitamos un concepto adicional antes de describir el algoritmo. Potencialmente podría haber muchas flujos máximos y estaremos interesados en los más equilibrados, que definimos formalmente de la siguiente manera. Arregle un poco de flujo máximo. Sea Ni P, T la cantidad de flujo del borde (i, t) (o de manera equivalente el número de trabajos asignados a i en el horario correspondiente), y que NP, t sea el tamaño total del flujo máximo, es decir, es decir,np, t = p i ni p, t. Para cualquier t ≤ t, defina ni p, t | t = min (ni p, t, t), es decir, truncamos el flujo/asignación en i para que la carga total en i sea como máximo t. Definir np, t | t = p i ni p, t | t. Definimos un flujo o asignación de prefijo-máxima para T de la siguiente manera. Definición 5.2 (flujo de prefijo-maximal) Un flujo para la red anterior con umbral t es prefijo máxima si para cada entero t ≤ t, tenemos np, t | t = np, t. Es decir, en un flujo de prefijo-máxima para (P, T), si truncamos el flujo en algún t ≤ t, nos queda un flujo máximo para (P, T). Un hecho elemental sobre flujos es que si una asignación/flujo x no es un flujo máximo para (p, t), entonces debe haber una ruta de aumento P = (s, j1, i1, ..., jk, ik, t)En el gráfico residual que nos permite aumentar el tamaño del flujo. La interpretación es que en la asignación actual, J1 no está asignado, xi j = 0, que se denota por los bordes delanteros (j, i) y xi j +1 = 1, que se denota por los bordes inversos (i, j+1). El aumento x usando P cambia la asignación para que cada j se asigne a I en la nueva asignación, lo que aumenta el valor del flujo en 1. Una ruta de aumento simple no disminuye la carga de ninguna máquina;Por lo tanto, se puede argumentar que siempre existe un flujo de prefijo máxima para un umbral T. Primero calculamos un flujo máximo para el umbral 1, usamos rutas de aumento simples para aumentarlo a un flujo máximo para el umbral 2, cada vez que aumenta el flujo máximo para el umbral anterior T a un flujo máximo para el umbral T.+ 1 Uso de rutas de aumento simples. Algoritmo 2 Dado un vector de tiempos de procesamiento P, construya una asignación de trabajos a máquinas de la siguiente manera.1. Calcule t ∗ (p) = min ˘ t ≥ h, t múltiple de l: np, t · l + (n - np, t) · h ≤ m · t ¯. Tenga en cuenta que NP, T · L+(N - NP, T) · H −M · T es una función decreciente de T, por lo que T ∗ (P) se puede calcular en tiempo polinómico a través de la búsqueda binaria.2. Calcule un flujo de prefijo-máxima para el umbral T ∗ (p) y la asignación parcial correspondiente (es decir, J se asigna a I IFF hay 1 unidad de flujo en el borde (j, i)).3. Asigne los trabajos restantes, es decir, los trabajos no asignados en la fase de flujo, de manera codiciosa de la siguiente manera. Considere estos trabajos en un orden arbitrario y asigne cada trabajo a la máquina con la carga más baja actual (donde la carga incluye los trabajos asignados en la fase de flujo). Nuestro algoritmo necesita calcular una asignación de prefijo máxima para el umbral t ∗ (p). La prueba que muestra la existencia de un flujo máximo prefijo solo produce un algoritmo de tiempo pseudopolinomial para calcularlo. Pero observe que el flujo máximo sigue siendo el mismo para cualquier t ≥ t = n · L., por lo que un flujo de prefijo máxima para t también es un prefijo máximo para cualquier t ≥ t. Por lo tanto, solo necesitamos calcular un flujo de prefijo máxima para t = min {t ∗ (p), t}. Esto se puede hacer en el tiempo polinomial utilizando el algoritmo iterativo de latas de augumento en la prueba de existencia para calcular iterativamente el máximo flujo para los polinómicamente muchos múltiplos de L hasta (e incluyendo) t. Teorema 5.3 Uno puede calcular eficientemente los pagos que cuando se combinan con el algoritmo 2 producen un mecanismo veraz de 2 de approximación determinista para el dominio de programación de dos valores.5.2 Análisis Deje OPT (P) denotar el MakePan óptimo para P.Ahora demostramos que el algoritmo 2 es un algoritmo de 2 de acerca de 2 que satisface la monotonicidad del ciclo. Esto luego nos permitirá calcular los pagos en la Sección 5.3 y probar el Teorema 5.3.5.2.1 Prueba de reclamo de aproximación 5.4 Si opta (p) <h, el makepan es como máximo opt (p). Prueba. Si opta (p) <h, debe ser que el cronograma óptimo asigne todos los trabajos a máquinas bajas, por lo tanto, NP, OPT (P) = n.Por lo tanto, tenemos t ∗ (p) = l · h l. Además, dado que calculamos un flujo de prefijo máxima para el umbral t ∗ (p) tenemos np, t ∗ (p) | opt (p) = np, opt (p) = n, lo que implica que la carga en cada máquina escomo máximo opt (p). Entonces, en este caso, el MakePan es como máximo (y por lo tanto exactamente) optar (P). Reclamación 5.5 Si opta (p) ≥ h, entonces t ∗ (p) ≤ l · opt (p) l ≤ opt (p) + l. prueba. Deje que NOPT (P) sea el número de trabajos asignados a máquinas bajas en un horario óptimo. La carga total en todas las máquinas es exactamente NOPT (P) · L + (N - NOPT (P)) · H, y es como máximo M · Opt (P), ya que cada máquina tiene carga como máximo OPT (P). Entonces, tomando t = l · opt (p) l ≥ h, ya que np, t ≥ nopt (p) tenemos que np, t · l+(n - np, t) · h ≤ m · t. Por lo tanto, t ∗ (p), la t más pequeña, es como máximo l · opt (p) l. Reclamación 5.6 Cada trabajo asignado en el paso 3 del algoritmo se asigna a una máquina alta.258 Prueba. Supongamos que J se asigna a la máquina I en el paso 3. Si Pij = L, entonces debemos tener Ni P, T ∗ (P) = T ∗ (P), de lo contrario podríamos haber asignado J a I en el Paso 2 para obtener un flujo de mayor valor. Entonces, en el punto justo antes de que J se asigne en el paso 3, la carga de cada máquina debe ser al menos t ∗ (p). Por lo tanto, la carga total después de J se asigna es al menos m · t ∗ (p) + l> m · t ∗ (p). Pero la carga total también es como máximo np, t ∗ (p) · l + (n - np, t ∗ (p)) · h ≤ m · t ∗ (p), produciendo una contradicción. LEMMA 5.7 El algoritmo anterior devuelve un horario con MakePan en la mayoría de los OPT (P)+Max ˘ L, H (1- 1 M) ¯ ≤ 2 · Opt (P). Prueba. Si opta (p) <h, entonces por el reclamo 5.4, terminamos. Entonces, supongamos que OPT (P) ≥ H. por reclamo 5.5, sabemos que t ∗ (p) ≤ opt (p) + L.(p) y terminamos. Entonces, suponga que hay algunos trabajos no asignados después del paso 2. Mostraremos que el MakEpan después del paso 3 es como máximo T +H `1- 1 m ´ donde t = min ˘ t ∗ (p), opt (p) ¯. Supongamos que el reclamo es falso. Sea la máquina con la carga máxima, por lo que li> t + h `1 - 1 m ´. Sea J el último trabajo asignado a I en el Paso 3, y considere el punto justo antes de que se asigne a i. Entonces li> t - h/m en este punto. Además, dado que J se asigna a I, por nuestra regla codiciosa, la carga en todas las otras máquinas debe ser al menos Li. Entonces, la carga total después de J se asigna J, es al menos H + M · Li> M · T (ya que PIJ = H por reclamo 5.6). Además, para cualquier asignación de trabajos a las máquinas en el paso 3, la carga total es como máximo np, t ∗ (p) · l + (n - np, t ∗ (p)) · h ya que hay np, t ∗ (p) trabajos asignados a máquinas bajas. Por lo tanto, debemos tener m · t <np, t ∗ (p) · l + (n - np, t ∗ (p)) · h. pero argumentaremos que m · t ≥ np, t ∗ (p) · ·L+(N - NP, T ∗ (P)) · H, que produce una contradicción. Si t = t ∗ (p), esto se deduce de la definición de t ∗ (p). Si t = opt (p), entonces dejar que NOPT (P) denota el número de trabajos asignados a máquinas bajas en un horario óptimo, tenemos NP, T ∗ (P) ≥ NOPT (P). Entonces np, t ∗ (p) · l+(n - np, t ∗ (p)) · h ≤ nopt (p) · l+(n - nopt (p)) · h. Esta es exactamente la carga total en un horario óptimo, que es como máximo M · Opt (P).5.2.2 Prueba de ciclo Monotonicidad Lemma 5.8 Considere dos casos P = (PI, P - I) y P = (PI, P - I) donde Pi ≥ Pi, es decir, PIJ ≥ PIJ ∀J. Si t es un umbral tal que np, t> np, t, entonces cada flujo máximo x para (p, t) debe asignar todos los trabajos j tal que pij = l. prueba. Deje que GP denote el gráfico residual para (P, T) y el flujo x. Supongamos por contradicción que existe un trabajo j ∗ con pij ∗ = l que no se asigna por x. Dado que Pi ≥ Pi, todos los bordes (J, I) que están presentes en la red para (P, T) también están presentes en la red para (P, T). Por lo tanto, X es un flujo válido para (P, T). Pero no es un flujo máximo, ya que np, t> np, t. Entonces existe una ruta de aumento P en el gráfico residual para (P, T) y el flujo x. Observe que el nodo I debe incluirse en P, de lo contrario, P también sería una ruta de aumento en el GP de gráfico residual que contradice el hecho de que X es un máximo de flujo. En particular, esto implica que hay una ruta P ⊂ P desde i hasta el fregadero t.Sea p = (i, j1, i1, ..., jk, ik, t). Todos los bordes de P también están presentes como bordes en GP, todos los bordes inversos (i, j +1) están presentes ya que tal borde implica que xi j +1 = 1;Todos los bordes delanteros (j, i) están presentes ya que i = i so pi j = pi j = l, y xi j +1 = 0. Pero luego hay una ruta de aumento (J ∗, I, J1, I1, ..., Jk, Ik, T) en GP que contradice la máxima máxima de x. Deje que L denote el vector de tiempo de procesamiento total. Defina TL I (P - I) = T ∗ (L, P - I). Dado que nos estamos centrando en la máquina I, y P - I se fija en todo momento, abreviamos TL I (P - I) a TL. Además, deje pl = (L, P - I). Tenga en cuenta que t ∗ (p) ≥ tl para cada instancia p = (pi, p - i). Corolario 5.9 Sea P = (PI, P-I) cualquier instancia y sea X cualquier flujo de prefijo máximo para (P, T ∗ (P)). Luego, la carga baja en la máquina I es como máximo TL. Prueba. Sea t ∗ = t ∗ (p). Si t ∗ = tl, entonces esto es claramente cierto. De lo contrario, considere la asignación x truncada en TL. Dado que X es prefijo-máxima, sabemos que esto constituye un flujo máximo para (P, TL). Además, np, t l <npl, t l porque t ∗> tl. Entonces, por Lemma 5.8, este flujo truncado debe asignar todos los trabajos bajos de i. Por lo tanto, no puede haber un trabajo j con pij = l que se asigne a I después del umbral TL desde entonces, J no sería asignado por este flujo truncado. Por lo tanto, la carga baja de I es como máximo TL. Usando estas propiedades, demostraremos la siguiente desigualdad clave: para cualquier p1 = (p - i, p1 i) y p2 = (p - i, p2 i), np1, t l ≥ np2, t l - n2,1 h + n2, 1 L (7) donde N2,1 H y N2,1 L están como se definen en (4) y (5), respectivamente. Observe que esto implica inmediatamente la monotonicidad del ciclo, ya que si tomamos p1 = pk y p2 = pk+1, entonces (7) implica que npk, t l ≥ npk+1, t l - nk+1, k h+nk+1, kL;sumando esto sobre todo k = 1 ,..., K da (6). Lema 5.10 Si t ∗ (p1)> tl, entonces (7) sostiene. Prueba. Deje t1 = t ∗ (p1) y t2 = t ∗ (p2). Tome el flujo de prefijo-maximal x2 para (p2, t2), truncarlo en TL y eliminar todos los trabajos de esta tarea que se cuentan en N2,1 h, es decir, todos los trabajos j tal que x2 ij = 1, p2ij = l, p1 ij = H. denota este flujo por x. Observe que X es un flujo válido para (P1, TL), y el tamaño de este flujo es exactamente NP2, T 2 | T L −N2,1 H = NP2, T L −n2,1 H. También ninguno de los trabajos que se cuentan en N2,1 L son asignados por X ya que cada uno de esos trabajos J es alto en I en P2. Desde t1> tl, debemos tener np1, t l <npl, t l. Entonces, si aumentamos X a un flujo máximo para (P1, TL), entonces por Lemma 5.8 (con P = PL y P = P1), todos los trabajos correspondientes a N2,1 L deben asignarse en este flujo máximo. Por lo tanto, el tamaño de este flujo máximo es al menos (tamaño de x) + n2,1 L, es decir, np1, t l ≥ np2, t l-n2,1 h + n2,1 L, como se afirma. Lema 5.11 Suponga t ∗ (p1) = tl. Entonces (7) sostiene. Prueba. Nuevamente, deje t1 = t ∗ (p1) = tl y t2 = t ∗ (p2). Sea X1, X2 la asignación completa, es decir, la asignación después de los pasos 2 y 3, calculado por nuestro algoritmo para P1, P2 respectivamente. Sea s = {j: x2 ij = 1 y p2 ij = l} y s = {j: x2 ij = 1 y p1 ij = l}. Por lo tanto, | S |= | S |- N2,1 H + N2,1 L y | S |= ni p2, t 2 = ni p2, t 2 | t l (por corolario 5.9). Sea t = | s |· L. Consideramos dos casos. Supongamos primero que t ≤ tl. Considere el siguiente flujo para (P1, TL): asigne a todas las máquinas que no sean la baja asignación de x2 truncada en TL y asigne los trabajos en S a la máquina i. Este es un flujo válido para (P1, TL) ya que la carga en I es T ≤ TL. Su tamaño es igual a p i = i ni p2, t 2 | t l +| s |= np2, t 2 | t l −n2,1 h +n2,1 l = np2, t l −n2,1 h +n2,1 l. El tamaño del flujo máximo para (P1, TL) no es más pequeño y el reclamo sigue.259 ahora supongamos t> tl. Desde | S |· L ≤ TL (por Corolario 5.9), se deduce que N2,1 L> N2,1 H ≥ 0. Sea ˆt = t - l ≥ tl ya que t, tl son múltiplos de L. Sea M = Np2, T 2 - N2,1 H + N2,1 L = | S |+ P i = i ni p2, t 2. Primero mostramos que M · ˆT <M · L + (N - M) · H. (8) Sea n el número de trabajos asignados a la máquina I en x2. La carga en la máquina I es | S | · L+(N - | S |) · H ≥ | S | · L - N2,1 L · L+(N− | S |) · H, que es al menos | S | ·L> ˆt desde n2,1 l ≤ n− | s |. Así obtenemos la desigualdad | S | · L+(N - | S |) · H> ˆT. Ahora considere el punto en la ejecución del algoritmo en la instancia P2 justo antes de que se asigne el último trabajo alto a I en el Paso 3 (debe haber tal trabajo desde N2,1 L> 0). La carga en I en este punto es | S |· L + (n - | s | - 1) · h que es menos | s |· L - L = ˆT por un argumento similar al de arriba. Por la propiedad codiciosa, cada i = i también tiene al menos esta carga en este punto, por lo que P j p2 i jx2 i j ≥ ˆt. Agregar estas desigualdades para todas las i = i, y la desigualdad anterior para i, obtenemos eso | S |· L + (n - | s |) · h + p i = i p j p2 i jx2 i j> m ˆt. Pero el lado izquierdo es exactamente m · l + (n-m) · h. por otro lado, ya que t1 = tl, tenemos m · ˆt ≥ m · tl ≥ np1, t l · l + (n −NP1, T L) · H. (9) Combinando (8) y (9), obtenemos que NP1, T L> M = NP2, T 2 - N2,1 H + N2,1 L ≥ NP2, T L - N2,1H + N2,1 l. LEMMA 5.12 Algoritmo 2 satisface la monotonicidad del ciclo. Prueba. Tomando p1 = pk y p2 = pk+1 en (7), obtenemos que npk, t l ≥ npk+1, t l −nk+1, k h+nk+1, k l. Sumando esto sobre todo k = 1 ,..., K (donde k + 1 ≡ 1) produce (6).5.3 Cálculo de los precios Lemmas 5.7 y 5.12 muestran que nuestro algoritmo es un algoritmo de 2 apropiación que satisface la monotonicidad del ciclo. Por lo tanto, mediante la discusión en la Sección 3, existen precios que producen un mecanismo veraz. Para obtener un mecanismo de tiempo polinómico, también debemos mostrar cómo calcular estos precios (o pagos) en tiempo polinómico. No está claro, si el procedimiento descrito en la Sección 3 basado en la calculación de rutas más cortas en el gráfico de asignación produce un algoritmo de tiempo polinomial, ya que el gráfico de asignación tiene un número exponencial de nodos (uno para cada asignación de salida). En lugar de analizar el gráfico de asignación, aprovecharemos nuestra prueba de monotonicidad del ciclo, en particular, desigualdad (7), y simplemente explicaremos los pagos. Recuerde que la utilidad de un jugador es ui = pi - li, donde Pi es el pago realizado al jugador i. Por conveniencia, primero especificaremos pagos negativos (es decir, el PIS en realidad se cobrará los precios a los jugadores) y luego mostraremos que estos pueden modificarse para que los jugadores tengan servicios públicos no negativos (si actúan con sinceridad). Permitir que denote el número de trabajos asignados a la máquina I en el paso 3. Por Corollary 5.6, sabemos que todos estos trabajos están asignados a máquinas altas (según los PI declarados). Deje h - i = p i = i hi y n - i p, t = p i = i ni p, t. El pago PI al jugador I se define como: Pi (P) = −l · N - I P, T ∗ (P) - H · H - I (P) - (H - L) `NP, T ∗ (P)- NP, T L I (P - I) ´ (10) Podemos interpretar que nuestros pagos equivalen al costo de los jugadores a una modificación cuidadosa de la carga total (en el espíritu de los precios de VCG). El primer y el segundo términos en (10), cuando se sutre de la carga, Li Equate es un costo para la carga total. El término np, t ∗ (p) - np, t l i (p - i) es de hecho igual a n - i p, t ∗ (p) - n - i p, t ∗ (p) | t l i (p - i (p - i) Dado que la carga baja en I es como máximo TL I (P-I) (por reclamo 5.9). Por lo tanto, el último término en la ecuación (10) implica que tratamos los trabajos bajos que se asignaron más allá del umbral de TL I (P - I) (a máquinas distintas a i) efectivamente como trabajos altos para el cálculo total de la utilidad desde el punto de vista es. No está claro cómo uno podría haber conjurado estos pagos a priori para demostrar la veracidad de nuestro algoritmo. Sin embargo, al confiar en la monotonicidad del ciclo, no solo pudimos argumentar la existencia de pagos, sino que también nuestra prueba allanó el camino para inferir estos pagos. El siguiente lema verifica explícitamente que los pagos definidos anteriormente realmente dan un mecanismo veraz. LEMMA 5.13 FIJA un jugador I y los otros jugadores declaraciones P - I. Deja que sea verdadero ser p1 i. Luego, bajo los pagos definidos en (10), está la utilidad cuando declara su verdadero tipo P1 I es al menos su utilidad cuando declara cualquier otro tipo P2 i. Prueba. Sea C1 I, C2 i denote es el costo total, definido como el negativo de su utilidad, cuando ella declara P1 y P2, respectivamente (y los demás declaran P - I). Como P - I es fijo, omitimos P - I de las expresiones a continuación para una claridad de notación. La verdadera carga de I cuando declara su verdadero tipo P1 I es L · Ni P1, T ∗ (P1) + H · Hi (P1) y, por lo tanto, C1 i = L · NP1, T ∗ (P1) + H · ((n - np1, t ∗ (p1)) + (h - l) `np1, t ∗ (p1) - np1, t l i ´ = n · h - (h - l) np1, t l i (11) en el otroMano, es una verdadera carga cuando declara P2 I es L · (Ni P2, T ∗ (P2) - N2,1 H + N2,1 L) + H · (Hi + N2,1 H - N2,1 L) (Dado que el vector de tiempo de procesamiento verdadero es p1 i) y, por lo tanto, c2 i = n · h - (h - l) np2, t l i + (h - l) n2,1 h - (h - l) n2,1 l. Por lo tanto, (7) implica que C1 I ≤ C2 i. Las especificaciones de precios son comúnmente necesarias para satisfacer, además de la veracidad, la racionalidad individual, es decir, la utilidad de los jugadores no debe ser negativa si revela su verdadero valor. Los pagos dados por (10) no son individualmente racionales, ya que realmente cobran a un jugador una cierta cantidad. Sin embargo, es bien sabido que este problema se puede resolver fácilmente agregando una constante lo suficiente a la definición de precios. En nuestro caso, por ejemplo, permitiendo que h denote el vector de todas las HS, podemos agregar el término n · h - (h −l) n (h, p - i), t l i (p - i) a (10). Tenga en cuenta que esto es una constante para el jugador i. Por lo tanto, los nuevos pagos son Pi (P) = N · H - L · N - I P, T ∗ (P) - H · H - I (P) - (H −l) `NP, T ∗ (P) - -np, t l i (p - i) +n (h, p - i), t l i (p - i) ´. Como se muestra por (11), esto dará como resultado una utilidad no negativa para i (ya que n (h, p-i), t l i (p-i) ≤ n (pi, p-i), t l i (P - i) Para cualquier tipo de Pi del jugador i). Esta modificación también garantiza la propiedad de normalización deseada adicionalmente deseada de que si un jugador no recibe trabajos, entonces recibe un pago cero: si el jugador recibe el conjunto vacío para algún tipo pi, también recibirá el conjunto vacío para el tipo H (esto es fácil deVerifique para nuestro algoritmo específico), y para el tipo H, su utilidad es igual a cero;Por lo tanto, con veracidad, esta también debe ser la utilidad de cualquier otra declaración que resulte en que reciba el conjunto vacío. Esto completa la prueba del teorema 5.3.260 5.4 imposibilidad de implementación exacta ahora mostramos que, independientemente de las consideraciones computacionales, no existe un algoritmo de ciclo monótono para el caso L-H con una relación de aproximación mejor que 1.14. Deje h = α · L para unos 2 <α <2.5 que elegiremos más adelante. Hay dos máquinas I, II y siete trabajos. Considere los siguientes dos escenarios: Escenario 1. Cada trabajo tiene el mismo tiempo de procesamiento en ambas máquinas: los trabajos 1-5, son L, y los trabajos 6, 7 son H. Cualquier horario óptimo asigna trabajos de 1 a 5 a una máquina y trabajos 6, 7 a la otra, y ha hecho que HacePanOpt1 = 5l. El segundo calendario ha hecho al menos segundo1 = 2H + L. Escenario 2. Si el algoritmo elige un cronograma óptimo para el escenario 1, suponga sin pérdida de generalidad que los trabajos 6, 7 se asignan a la máquina II. En el escenario 2, la máquina I tiene el mismo vector de tiempo de procesamiento. La máquina II reduce los trabajos 6, 7 a L y aumenta 1-5 a H. Un horario óptimo tiene 2L + H, donde la máquina II obtiene trabajos 6, 7 y uno de los trabajos 1-5. El segundo mejor calendario para este escenario ha hecho al menos segundo2 = 5L. Teorema 5.14 Ningún mecanismo verdadero determinista para el problema de programación de dos valores puede obtener una relación de aproximación mejor que 1.14. Prueba. Primero argumentamos que un algoritmo monótono de ciclo no puede elegir el horario óptimo en ambos escenarios. Esto sigue porque de lo contrario se viola la monotonicidad del ciclo para la máquina II. Tomando P1 II, P2 II para ser vectores de tiempo de procesamiento de la máquina para los escenarios 1, 2 respectivamente, obtenemos P J (P1 II, J - P2 II, J) (X2 II, J −x1 II, J) = (L - H) (1-0) <0. Por lo tanto, cualquier mecanismo veraz debe devolver un haz de hacer un escenario subóptimo en al menos un escenario y, por lo tanto, su relación de aproximación es al menos min ˘second1 opt1, segundo2 opt2 ¯ ≥ 1.14 para α = 2.364. Observamos que para el {lj, hj} -case donde hay una relación común r = hj lj para todos los trabajos (esto generaliza la configuración de máquinas restringidas) uno puede obtener un mecanismo veraz fraccional (con precios eficientemente computables)Programa de MakePan a lo sumo OPT (P) por cada p.Uno puede ver cada trabajo j como constante de sub-Jobs de tamaño 1 en una máquina I si pij = lj, y tamaño r si pij = hj. Para esta nueva instancia ˜p, tenga en cuenta que ˜pij ∈ {1, r} para cada i, j. Observe también que cualquier asignación ˜x para la instancia ˜p se traduce en una asignación fraccional x para p, donde pijxiJ = p j: sub-Job de j ˜pij ˜xij. Por lo tanto, si usamos el algoritmo 2 para obtener un cronograma para la instancia ˜p, la ecuación (6) se traduce con precisión a (3) para la asignación x;Además, los precios de ˜P se traducen en precios para la instancia p.El número de subjobs asignados a las máquinas bajas en la fase de flujo es simplemente el trabajo total asignado a las máquinas bajas. Por lo tanto, podemos implementar la reducción anterior configurando un problema de flujo máximo que parece maximizar el trabajo total asignado a máquinas bajas. Además, dado que tenemos un dominio fraccional, podemos usar una regla codiciosa más eficiente para empacar las porciones no asignadas de trabajos y argumentar que la tarea fraccional tiene una marca a lo sumo (p). Sin embargo, la asignación x no necesita satisfacer la condición de que Xij> 0 implique PIJ ≤ OPT (P) para la R arbitraria, por lo tanto, el procedimiento de redondeo de Lemma 4.2 no produce un mecanismo de 2 de aportación de 2 de aptitud. Pero si R> opt (P) (como en la configuración de máquinas restringidas), esta condición se mantiene, por lo que obtenemos un mecanismo veraz de 2 de la acroximación.

        "This is a multidimensional scheduling domain, and the only known positive results for makespan minimization in such a domain are O(m)-approximation truthful mechanisms [22, 20].",
        "We study a well-motivated special case of this problem, where the processing time of a job on each machine may either be low or high, and the low and high values are public and job-dependent.",
        "This preserves the multidimensionality of the domain, and generalizes the restricted-machines (i.e., {pj, ∞}) setting in scheduling.",
        "We give a general technique to convert any c-approximation algorithm to a 3capproximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism.",
        "This is one of the few known results that shows how to export approximation algorithms for a multidimensional problem into truthful mechanisms in a black-box fashion.",
        "When the low and high values are the same for all jobs, we devise a deterministic 2-approximation truthful mechanism.",
        "These are the first truthful mechanisms with non-trivial performance guarantees for a multidimensional scheduling domain.",
        "Our constructions are novel in two respects.",
        "First, we do not utilize or rely on explicit price definitions to prove truthfulness; instead we design algorithms that satisfy cycle monotonicity.",
        "Cycle monotonicity [23] is a necessary and sufficient condition for truthfulness, is a generalization of value monotonicity for multidimensional domains.",
        "However, whereas value monotonicity has been used extensively and successfully to design truthful mechanisms in singledimensional domains, ours is the first work that leverages cycle monotonicity in the multidimensional setting.",
        "Second, our randomized mechanisms are obtained by first constructing a fractional truthful mechanism for a fractional relaxation of the problem, and then converting it into a truthfulin-expectation mechanism.",
        "This builds upon a technique of [16], and shows the usefulness of fractional mechanisms in truthful mechanism design.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors F.2 [Analysis of Algorithms and Problem Complexity]; J.4 [Social and Behavioral Sciences]: Economics General Terms Algorithms, Economics, Theory 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Mechanism design studies algorithmic constructions under the presence of strategic players who hold the inputs to the algorithm.",
        "Algorithmic mechanism design has focused mainly on settings were the social planner or designer wishes to maximize the social welfare (or equivalently, minimize social cost), or on auction settings where revenuemaximization is the main goal.",
        "Alternative optimization goals, such as those that incorporate fairness criteria (which have been investigated algorithmically and in social choice theory), have received very little or no attention.",
        "In this paper, we consider such an alternative goal in the context of machine scheduling, namely, makespan minimization.",
        "There are n jobs or tasks that need to be assigned to m machines, where each job has to be assigned to exactly one machine.",
        "Assigning a job j to a machine i incurs a load (cost) of pij ≥ 0 on machine i, and the load of a machine is the sum of the loads incurred due to the jobs assigned to it; the goal is to schedule the jobs so as to minimize the maximum load of a machine, which is termed the makespan of the schedule.",
        "Makespan minimization is a common objective in scheduling environments, and has been well studied algorithmically in both the Computer Science and Operations Research communities (see, e.g., the survey [12]).",
        "Following the work of Nisan and Ronen [22], we consider each machine to be a strategic player or agent who privately knows its own processing time for each job, and may misrepresent these values in order to decrease its load (which is its incurred cost).",
        "Hence, we approach the problem via mechanism design: the social designer, who holds the set of jobs to be assigned, needs to specify, in addition to a schedule, suitable payments to the players in order to incentivize them to reveal their true processing times.",
        "Such a mechanism is called a truthful mechanism.",
        "The makespan-minimization objective is quite different from the classic goal of social-welfare maximization, where one wants to maximize the total welfare (or minimize the total cost) of all players.",
        "Instead, it 252 corresponds to maximizing the minimum welfare and the notion of max-min fairness, and appears to be a much harder problem from the viewpoint of mechanism design.",
        "In particular, the celebrated VCG [26, 9, 10] family of mechanisms does not apply here, and we need to devise new techniques.",
        "The possibility of constructing a truthful mechanism for makespan minimization is strongly related to assumptions on the players processing times, in particular, the dimensionality of the domain.",
        "Nisan and Ronen considered the setting of unrelated machines where the pij values may be arbitrary.",
        "This is a multidimensional domain, since a players private value is its entire vector of processing times (pij)j.",
        "Very few positive results are known for multidimensional domains in general, and the only positive results known for multidimensional scheduling are O(m)-approximation truthful mechanisms [22, 20].",
        "We emphasize that regardless of computational considerations, even the existence of a truthful mechanism with a significantly better (than m) approximation ratio is not known for any such scheduling domain.",
        "On the negative side, [22] showed that no truthful deterministic mechanism can achieve approximation ratio better than 2, and strengthened this lower bound to m for two specific classes of deterministic mechanisms.",
        "Recently, [20] extended this lower bound to randomized mechanisms, and [8] improved the deterministic lower bound.",
        "In stark contrast with the above state of affairs, much stronger (and many more) positive results are known for a special case of the unrelated machines problem, namely, the setting of related machines.",
        "Here, we have pij = pj/si for every i, j, where pj is public knowledge, and the speed si is the only private parameter of machine i.",
        "This assumption makes the domain of players types single-dimensional.",
        "Truthfulness in such domains is equivalent to a convenient value-monotonicity condition [21, 3], which appears to make it significantly easier to design truthful mechanisms in such domains.",
        "Archer and Tardos [3] first considered the related machines setting and gave a randomized 3-approximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism.",
        "The gap between the single-dimensional and multidimensional domains is perhaps best exemplified by the fact that [3] showed that there exists a truthful mechanism that always outputs an optimal schedule. (Recall that in the multidimensional unrelated machines setting, it is impossible to obtain a truthful mechanism with approximation ratio better than 2.)",
        "Various follow-up results [2, 4, 1, 13] have strengthened the notion of truthfulness and/or improved the approximation ratio.",
        "Such difficulties in moving from the single-dimensional to the multidimensional setting also arise in other mechanism design settings (e.g., combinatorial auctions).",
        "Thus, in addition to the specific importance of scheduling in strategic environments, ideas from multidimensional scheduling may also have a bearing in the more general context of truthful mechanism design for multidimensional domains.",
        "In this paper, we consider the makespan-minimization problem for a special case of unrelated machines, where the processing time of a job is either low or high on each machine.",
        "More precisely, in our setting, pij ∈ {Lj, Hj} for every i, j, where the Lj, Hj values are publicly known (Lj ≡low, Hj ≡high).",
        "We call this model the jobdependent two-values case.",
        "This model generalizes the classic restricted machines setting, where pij ∈ {Lj, ∞} which has been well-studied algorithmically.",
        "A special case of our model is when Lj = L and Hj = H for all jobs j, which we denote simply as the two-values scheduling model.",
        "Both of our domains are multidimensional, since the machines are unrelated: one job may be low on one machine and high on the other, while another job may follow the opposite pattern.",
        "Thus, the private information of each machine is a vector specifying which jobs are low and high on it.",
        "Thus, they retain the core property underlying the hardness of truthful mechanism design for unrelated machines, and by studying these special settings we hope to gain some insights that will be useful for tackling the general problem.",
        "Our Results and Techniques We present various positive results for our multidimensional scheduling domains.",
        "Our first result is a general method to convert any capproximation algorithm for the job-dependent two values setting into a 3c-approximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism.",
        "This is one of the very few known results that use an approximation algorithm in a black-box fashion to obtain a truthful mechanism for a multidimensional problem.",
        "Our result implies that there exists a 3-approximation truthfulin-expectation mechanism for the Lj-Hj setting.",
        "Interestingly, the proof of truthfulness is not based on supplying explicit prices, and our construction does not necessarily yield efficiently-computable prices (but the allocation rule is efficiently computable).",
        "Our second result applies to the twovalues setting (Lj = L, Hj = H), for which we improve both the approximation ratio and strengthen the notion of truthfulness.",
        "We obtain a deterministic 2-approximation truthful mechanism (along with prices) for this problem.",
        "These are the first truthful mechanisms with non-trivial performance guarantees for a multidimensional scheduling domain.",
        "Complementing this, we observe that even this seemingly simple setting does not admit truthful mechanisms that return an optimal schedule (unlike in the case of related machines).",
        "By exploiting the multidimensionality of the domain, we prove that no truthful deterministic mechanism can obtain an approximation ratio better than 1.14 to the makespan (irrespective of computational considerations).",
        "The main technique, and one of the novelties, underlying our constructions and proofs, is that we do not rely on explicit price specifications in order to prove the truthfulness of our mechanisms.",
        "Instead we exploit certain algorithmic monotonicity conditions that characterize truthfulness to first design an implementable algorithm, i.e., an algorithm for which prices ensuring truthfulness exist, and then find these prices (by further delving into the proof of implementability).",
        "This kind of analysis has been the method of choice in the design of truthful mechanisms for singledimensional domains, where value-monotonicity yields a convenient characterization enabling one to concentrate on the algorithmic side of the problem (see, e.g., [3, 7, 4, 1, 13]).",
        "But for multidimensional domains, almost all positive results have relied on explicit price specifications in order to prove truthfulness (an exception is the work on unknown single-minded players in combinatorial auctions [17, 7]), a fact that yet again shows the gap in our understanding of multidimensional vs. single-dimensional domains.",
        "Our work is the first to leverage monotonicity conditions for truthful mechanism design in arbitrary domains.",
        "The monotonicity condition we use, which is sometimes called cycle monotonicity, was first proposed by Rochet [23] (see also [11]).",
        "It is a generalization of value-monotonicity and completely characterizes truthfulness in every domain.",
        "Our methods and analyses demonstrate the potential benefits 253 of this characterization, and show that cycle monotonicity can be effectively utilized to devise truthful mechanisms for multidimensional domains.",
        "Consider, for example, our first result showing that any c-approximation algorithm can be exported to a 3c-approximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism.",
        "At the level of generality of an arbitrary approximation algorithm, it seems unlikely that one would be able to come up with prices to prove truthfulness of the constructed mechanism.",
        "But, cycle monotonicity does allow us to prove such a statement.",
        "In fact, some such condition based only on the underlying algorithm (and not on the prices) seems necessary to prove such a general statement.",
        "The method for converting approximation algorithms into truthful mechanisms involves another novel idea.",
        "Our randomized mechanism is obtained by first constructing a truthful mechanism that returns a fractional schedule.",
        "Moving to a fractional domain allows us to plug-in truthfulness into the approximation algorithm in a rather simple fashion, while losing a factor of 2 in the approximation ratio.",
        "We then use a suitable randomized rounding procedure to convert the fractional assignment into a random integral assignment.",
        "For this, we use a recent rounding procedure of Kumar et al. [14] that is tailored for unrelated-machine scheduling.",
        "This preserves truthfulness, but we lose another additive factor equal to the approximation ratio.",

        "The algorithmic problem (i.e., without requiring truthfulness) of makespan-minimization on unrelated machines is well understood and various 2-approximation algorithms are known.",

        "The two-values case, which is a special case of above where Lj = L and Hj = H for all jobs j, i.e., pij ∈ {L, H} for every i, j.",
        "We say that a job j is low on machine i if pij = Lj, and high if pij = Hj.",
        "We will use the terms schedule and assignment interchangeably.",
        "We represent a deterministic schedule by a vector x = (xij)i,j, where xij is 1 if job j is assigned to machine i, thus we have xij ∈ {0, 1} for every i, j, P i xij = 1 for every job j.",
        "We will also consider randomized algorithms and algorithms that return a fractional assignment.",
        "In both these settings, we will again specify an assignment by a vector x = (xij)i,j with P j xij = 1, but now xij ∈ [0, 1] for every i, j.",
        "For a randomized algorithm, xij is simply the probability that j is assigned to i (thus, x is a convex combination of integer assignments).",
        "We denote the load of machine i (under a given assignment) by li = P j xijpij, and the makespan of a schedule is defined as the maximum load on any machine, i.e., maxi li.",
        "The goal in the makespan-minimization problem is to assign the jobs to the machines so as to minimize the makespan of the schedule. 2.2 Mechanism design We consider the makespan-minimization problem in the above scheduling domains in the context of mechanism design.",
        "Mechanism design studies strategic settings where the social designer needs to ensure the cooperation of the different entities involved in the algorithmic procedure.",
        "Following the work of Nisan and Ronen [22], we consider the machines to be the strategic players or agents.",
        "The social designer holds the set of jobs that need to be assigned, but does 254 not know the (true) processing times of these jobs on the different machines.",
        "Each machine is a selfish entity, that privately knows its own processing time for each job. on a machine incurs a cost to the machine equal to the true processing time of the job on the machine, and a machine may choose to misrepresent its vector of processing times, which are private, in order to decrease its cost.",
        "We consider direct-revelation mechanisms: each machine reports its (possibly false) vector of processing times, the mechanism then computes a schedule and hands out payments to the players (i.e., machines) to compensate them for the cost they incur in processing their assigned jobs.",
        "A (direct-revelation) mechanism thus consists of a tuple (x, P): x specifies the schedule, and P = {Pi} specifies the payments handed out to the machines, where both x and the Pis are functions of the reported processing times p = (pij)i,j.",
        "The mechanisms goal is to compute a schedule that has near-optimal makespan with respect to the true processing times; a machine i is however only interested in maximizing its own utility, Pi − li, where li is its load under the output assignment, and may declare false processing times if this could increase its utility.",
        "The mechanism must therefore incentivize the machines/players to truthfully reveal their processing times via the payments.",
        "This is made precise using the notion of dominant-strategy truthfulness.",
        "Definition 2.1 (Truthfulness) A scheduling mechanism is truthful if, for every machine i, every vector of processing times of the other machines, p−i, every true processing-time vector p1 i and any other vector p2 i of machine i, we have: P1 i − X j x1 ijp1 ij ≥ P2 i − X j x2 ijp1 ij, (1) where (x1 , P1 ) and (x2 , P2 ) are respectively the schedule and payments when the other machines declare p−i and machine i declares p1 i and p2 i , i.e., x1 = x(p1 i , p−i), P1 i = Pi(p1 i , p−i) and x2 = x(p2 i , p−i), P2 i = Pi(p2 i , p−i).",
        "To put it in words, in a truthful mechanism, no machine can improve its utility by declaring a false processing time, no matter what the other machines declare.",
        "We will also consider fractional mechanisms that return a fractional assignment, and randomized mechanisms that are allowed to toss coins and where the assignment and the payments may be random variables.",
        "The notion of truthfulness for a fractional mechanism is the same as in Definition 2.1, where x1 , x2 are now fractional assignments.",
        "For a randomized mechanism, we will consider the notion of truthfulness in expectation [3], which means that a machine (player) maximizes her expected utility by declaring her true processing-time vector.",
        "Inequality (1) also defines truthfulness-in-expectation for a randomized mechanism, where P1 i , P2 i now denote the expected payments made to player i, x1 , x2 are the fractional assignments denoting the randomized algorithms schedule (i.e., xk ij is the probability that j is assigned to i in the schedule output for (pk i , p−i)).",
        "For our two scheduling domains, the informational assumption is that the values Lj, Hj are publicly known.",
        "The private information of a machine is which jobs have value Lj (or L) and which ones have value Hj (or H) on it.",
        "We emphasize that both of our domains are multidimensional, since each machine i needs to specify a vector saying which jobs are low and high on it. 3.",
        "CYCLE MONOTONICITY Although truthfulness is defined in terms of payments, it turns out that truthfulness actually boils down to a certain algorithmic condition of monotonicity.",
        "This seems to have been first observed for multidimensional domains by Rochet [23] in 1987, and has been used successfully in algorithmic mechanism design several times, but for singledimensional domains.",
        "However for multidimensional domains, the monotonicity condition is more involved and there has been no success in employing it in the design of truthful mechanisms.",
        "Most positive results for multidimensional domains have relied on explicit price specifications in order to prove truthfulness.",
        "One of the main contributions of this paper is to demonstrate that the monotonicity condition for multidimensional settings, which is sometimes called cycle monotonicity, can indeed be effectively utilized to devise truthful mechanisms.",
        "We include a brief exposition on it for completeness.",
        "The exposition here is largely based on [11].",
        "Cycle monotonicity is best described in the abstract social choice setting: there is a finite set A of alternatives, there are m players, and each player has a private type (valuation function) v : A → R, where vi(a) should be interpreted as is value for alternative a.",
        "In the scheduling domain, A represents all the possible assignments of jobs to machines, and vi(a) is the negative of is load in the schedule a.",
        "Let Vi denote the set of all possible types of player i.",
        "A mechanism is a tuple (f, {Pi}) where f : V1 × · · · × Vm → A is the algorithm for choosing the alternative, and Pi : V1 × · · · × Vm → A is the price charged to player i (in the scheduling setting, the mechanism pays the players, which corresponds to negative prices).",
        "The mechanism is truthful if for every i, every v−i ∈ V−i = Q i =i Vi , and any vi, vi ∈ Vi we have vi(a) − Pi(vi, v−i) ≥ vi(b) − Pi(vi, v−i), where a = f(vi, v−i) and b = f(vi, v−i).",
        "A basic question that arises is given an algorithm f : V1 × · · · × Vm → A, do there exist prices that will make the resulting mechanism truthful?",
        "It is well known (see e.g. [15]) that the price Pi can only depend on the alternative chosen and the others declarations, that is, we may write Pi : V−i × A → R. Thus, truthfulness implies that for every i, every v−i ∈ V−i, and any vi, vi ∈ Vi with f(vi, v−i) = a and f(vi, v−i) = b, we have vi(a) − Pi(a, v−i) ≥ vi(b) − Pi(b, v−i).",
        "Now fix a player i, and fix the declarations v−i of the others.",
        "We seek an assignment to the variables {Pa}a∈A such that vi(a) − vi(b) ≥ Pa − Pb for every a, b ∈ A and vi ∈ Vi with f(vi, v−i) = a. (Strictly speaking, we should use A = f(Vi, v−i) instead of A here.)",
        "Define δa,b := inf{vi(a)− vi(b) : vi ∈ Vi, f(vi, v−i) = a}.",
        "We can now rephrase the above price-assignment problem: we seek an assignment to the variables {Pa}a∈A such that Pa − Pb ≤ δa,b ∀a, b ∈ A (2) This is easily solved by looking at the allocation graph and applying a standard basic result of graph theory.",
        "Definition 3.1 (Gui et al. [11]) The allocation graph of f is a directed weighted graph G = (A, E) where E = A × A and the weight of an edge b → a (for any a, b ∈ A) is δa,b.",

        "This conversion works even when the approximation algorithm returns only a fractional schedule (satisfying certain properties) of makespan at most c · OPT(p) for every instance p. We prove truthfulness by showing that the fractional algorithm satisfies cycle monotonicity (3).",
        "Notice that the alternative-set of our fractional mechanism is finite (although the set of all fractional assignments is infinite): its cardinality is at most that of the inputdomain, which is at most 2mn in the two-value case.",
        "Thus, we can apply Corollary 3.4 here.",
        "To convert this fractional truthful mechanism into a randomized truthful mechanism we need a randomized rounding procedure satisfying the requirements of Lemma 4.1.",

        "Now the left hand side of the above inequality for this segment is simply xk ij (Lj −Hj)+xk∗ ij (Hj −Lj) ≥ 0, since xk ij ≤ 1 m ≤ xk∗ ij as pk ij = Hj and pk∗ ij = Lj.",

        "Thus, if we use Algorithm 2 to obtain a schedule for the instance ˜p, equation (6) translates precisely to (3) for the assignment x; moreover, the prices for ˜p translate to prices for the instance p. The number of sub-jobs assigned to low-machines in the flow-phase is simply the total work assigned to low-machines.",
        "Thus, we can implement the above reduction by setting up a max-flow problem that seems to maximize the total work assigned to low machines.",
        "Moreover, since we have a fractional domain, we can use a more efficient greedy rule for packing the unassigned portions of jobs and argue that the fractional assignment has makespan at most OPT(p).",
        "The assignment x need not however satisfy the condition that xij > 0 implies pij ≤ OPT(p) for arbitrary r, therefore, the rounding procedure of Lemma 4.2 does not yield a 2-approximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism.",

                "Makespan minimization is a common objective in scheduling environments, and has been well studied algorithmically in both the Computer Science and Operations Research communities (see, e.g., the survey [12]).",
                "Following the work of Nisan and Ronen [22], we consider each machine to be a strategic player or agent who privately knows its own processing time for each job, and may misrepresent these values in order to decrease its load (which is its incurred cost).",
                "Hence, we approach the problem via <br>mechanism design</br>: the social designer, who holds the set of jobs to be assigned, needs to specify, in addition to a schedule, suitable payments to the players in order to incentivize them to reveal their true processing times.",

                "By exploiting the multidimensionality of the domain, we prove that no truthful deterministic mechanism can obtain an approximation ratio better than 1.14 to the makespan (irrespective of computational considerations).",
                "The main technique, and one of the novelties, underlying our constructions and proofs, is that we do not rely on explicit price specifications in order to prove the truthfulness of our mechanisms.",
                "Instead we exploit certain algorithmic monotonicity conditions that characterize truthfulness to first design an implementable algorithm, i.e., an algorithm for which prices ensuring truthfulness exist, and then find these prices (by further delving into the proof of implementability).",
                "This kind of analysis has been the method of choice in the design of truthful mechanisms for singledimensional domains, where value-monotonicity yields a convenient characterization enabling one to concentrate on the algorithmic side of the problem (see, e.g., [3, 7, 4, 1, 13]).",

                "Makespan minimization is a common objective in scheduling environments, and has been well studied algorithmically in both the Computer Science and Operations Research communities (see, e.g., the survey [12]).",
                "Following the work of Nisan and Ronen [22], we consider each machine to be a strategic player or agent who privately knows its own processing time for each job, and may misrepresent these values in order to decrease its load (which is its incurred cost).",
                "Hence, we approach the problem via mechanism design: the social designer, who holds the set of jobs to be assigned, needs to specify, in addition to a schedule, suitable payments to the players in order to incentivize them to reveal their true processing times.",
                "Such a mechanism is called a truthful mechanism.",
