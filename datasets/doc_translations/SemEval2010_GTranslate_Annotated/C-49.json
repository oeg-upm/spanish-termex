Kotz Institute for Security Technology Studies (ISTS) Department of Computer Science, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA 03755 ABSTRACT Traditional mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) routing protocols assume that contemporaneous end-to-end communication paths exist between data senders and receivers. In some mobile ad-hoc networks with a sparse node population, an end-to-end communication path may break frequently or may not exist at any time. Many routing protocols have been proposed in the literature to address the problem, but few were evaluated in a realistic opportunistic network setting. We use simulation and contact traces (derived from logs in a production network) to evaluate and compare five existing protocols: direct-delivery, epidemic, random, PRoPHET, and Link-State, as well as our own proposed routing protocol. We show that the direct delivery and epidemic routing protocols suffer either low delivery ratio or high resource usage, and other protocols make tradeoffs between delivery ratio and resource usage.

INTRODUCTION Mobile opportunistic networks are one kind of delay-tolerant network (DTN) [6]. Delay-tolerant networks provide service despite long link delays or frequent link breaks. Long link delays happen in networks with communication between nodes at a great distance, such as interplanetary networks [2]. Link breaks are caused by nodes moving out of range, environmental changes, interference from other moving objects, radio power-offs, or failed nodes. For us, mobile opportunistic networks are those DTNs with sparse node population and frequent link breaks caused by power-offs and the mobility of the nodes. Mobile opportunistic networks have received increasing interest from researchers. In the literature, these networks include mobile sensor networks [25], wild-animal tracking networks [11], pocketswitched networks [8], and transportation networks [1, 14]. We expect to see more opportunistic networks when the one-laptopper-child (OLPC) project [18] starts rolling out inexpensive laptops with wireless networking capability for children in developing countries, where often no infrastructure exits. Opportunistic networking is one promising approach for those children to exchange information. One fundamental problem in opportunistic networks is how to route messages from their source to their destination. Mobile opportunistic networks differ from the Internet in that disconnections are the norm instead of the exception. In mobile opportunistic networks, communication devices can be carried by people [4], vehicles [1] or animals [11]. Some devices can form a small mobile ad-hoc network when the nodes move close to each other. But a node may frequently be isolated from other nodes. Note that traditional Internet routing protocols and ad-hoc routing protocols, such as AODV [20] or DSDV [19], assume that a contemporaneous endto-end path exists, and thus fail in mobile opportunistic networks. Indeed, there may never exist an end-to-end path between two given devices. In this paper, we study protocols for routing messages between wireless networking devices carried by people. We assume that people send messages to other people occasionally, using their devices; when no direct link exists between the source and the destination of the message, other nodes may relay the message to the destination. Each device represents a unique person (it is out of the scope of this paper when a device maybe carried by multiple people). Each message is destined for a specific person and thus for a specific node carried by that person. Although one person may carry multiple devices, we assume that the sender knows which device is the best to receive the message. We do not consider multicast or geocast in this paper. Many routing protocols have been proposed in the literature. Few of them were evaluated in realistic network settings, or even in realistic simulations, due to the lack of any realistic people mobility model. Random walk or random way-point mobility models are often used to evaluate the performance of those routing protocols. Although these synthetic mobility models have received extensive interest by mobile ad-hoc network researchers [3], they do not reflect peoples mobility patterns [9]. Realising the limitations of using random mobility models in simulations, a few researchers have studied routing protocols in mobile opportunistic networks with realistic mobility traces. Chaintreau et al. [5] theoretically analyzed the impact of routing algorithms over a model derived from a realistic mobility data set. Su et al. [22] simulated a set of routing 35 protocols in a small experimental network. Those studies help researchers better understand the theoretical limits of opportunistic networks, and the routing protocol performance in a small network (20-30 nodes). Deploying and experimenting large-scale mobile opportunistic networks is difficult, we too resort to simulation. Instead of using a complex mobility model to mimic peoples mobility patterns, we used mobility traces collected in a production wireless network at Dartmouth College to drive our simulation. Our messagegeneration model, however, was synthetic. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simulate the effect of routing protocols in a large-scale mobile opportunistic network, using realistic contact traces derived from real traces of a production network with more than 5, 000 users. Using realistic contact traces, we evaluate the performance of three naive routing protocols (direct-delivery, epidemic, and random) and two prediction-based routing protocols, PRoPHET [16] and Link-State [22]. We also propose a new prediction-based routing protocol, and compare it to the above in our evaluation. 2. ROUTING PROTOCOL A routing protocol is designed for forwarding messages from one node (source) to another node (destination). Any node may generate messages for any other node, and may carry messages destined for other nodes. In this paper, we consider only messages that are unicast (single destination). DTN routing protocols could be described in part by their transfer probability and replication probability; that is, when one node meets another node, what is the probability that a message should be transfered and if so, whether the sender should retain its copy. Two extremes are the direct-delivery protocol and the epidemic protocol. The former transfers with probability 1 when the node meets the destination, 0 for others, and no replication. The latter uses transfer probability 1 for all nodes and unlimited replication. Both these protocols have their advantages and disadvantages. All other protocols are between the two extremes. First, we define the notion of contact between two nodes. Then we describe five existing protocols before presenting our own proposal. A contact is defined as a period of time during which two nodes have the opportunity to communicate. Although we are aware that wireless technologies differ, we assume that a node can reliably detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes. A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time. The contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other nodes. Node i has a contact history Hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j. We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message. In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network. The source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets. The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet. Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message. This protocol is simple, but may use significant resources; excessive communication may drain each nodes battery quickly. Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited. At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops. After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message. An optimization to reduce the communication cost is to transfer index messages before transferring any data message. The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds. Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact. We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies. The message has some chance of being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires. 2.4 PRoPHET Protocol PRoPHET [16] is a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of past Encounters and Transitivity to estimate each nodes delivery probability for each other node. When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network. Lindgren et al. [16] chose 0.75, as did we in our evaluation. When node i does not meet j for some time, the delivery probability decreases by pij = αk pij, (2) where α is the aging factor (α < 1), and k is the number of time units since the last update. The PRoPHET protocol exchanges index messages as well as delivery probabilities. When node i receives node js delivery probabilities, node i may compute the transitive delivery probability through j to z with piz = piz + (1 − piz)pijpjzβ, (3) where β is a design parameter for the impact of transitivity; we used β = 0.25 as did Lindgren [16]. 2.5 Link-State Protocol Su et al. [22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination. They use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged intercontact duration as the weight on links. The exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)I, (4) where I is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor. Nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight. 36 3. TIMELY-CONTACT PROBABILITY We also use historical contact information to estimate the probability of meeting other nodes in the future. But our method differs in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time. For example, what is the contact probability in the next hour? Neither PRoPHET nor Link-State considers time in this way. One way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the ratio of the total contact duration to the total time. However, this approach does not capture the frequency of contacts. For example, one node may have a long contact with another node, followed by a long non-contact period. A third node may have a short contact with the first node, followed by a short non-contact period. Using the above estimation approach, both examples would have similar contact probability. In the second example, however, the two nodes have more frequent contacts. We design a method to capture the contact frequency of mobile nodes. For this purpose, we assume that even short contacts are sufficient to exchange messages.1 The probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the following procedure. We divide the contact history Hi(j) into a sequence of n periods of ΔT starting from the start time (t0) of the first contact in history Hi(j) to the current time. We number each of the n periods from 0 to n − 1, then check each period. If node i had any contact with node j during a given period m, which is [t0 + mΔT, t0 + (m + 1)ΔT), we set the contact status Im to be 1; otherwise, the contact status Im is 0. The probability p (0) ij that node i meets node j in the next ΔT can be estimated as the average of the contact status in prior intervals: p (0) ij = 1 n n−1X m=0 Im. (5) To adapt to the change of contact patterns, and reduce the storage space for contact histories, a node may discard old history contacts; in this situation, the estimate would be based on only the retained history. The above probability is the direct contact probability of two nodes. We are also interested in the probability that we may be able to pass a message through a sequence of k nodes. We define the k-order probability inductively, p (k) ij = p (0) ij + X α p (0) iα p (k−1) αj , (6) where α is any node other than i or j. 3.1 Our Routing Protocol We first consider the case of a two-hop path, that is, with only one relay node. We consider two approaches: either the receiving neighbor decides whether to act as a relay, or the source decides which neighbors to use as relay. 3.1.1 Receiver Decision Whenever a node meets other nodes, they exchange all their messages (or as above, index messages). If the destination of a message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered. Otherwise, if the probability of delivering the message to its destination through this receiver node within ΔT is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, the message is stored in the receivers storage to forward 1 In our simulation, however, we accurately model the communication costs and some short contacts will not succeed in transfer of all messages. to the destination. If the probability is less than the threshold, the receiver discards the message. Notice that our protocol replicates the message whenever a good-looking relay comes along. 3.1.2 Sender Decision To make decisions, a sender must have the information about its neighbors contact probability with a messages destination. Therefore, meta-data exchange is necessary. When two nodes meet, they exchange a meta-message, containing an unordered list of node IDs for which the sender of the metamessage has a contact probability greater than the threshold. After receiving a meta-message, a node checks whether it has any message that destined to its neighbor, or to a node in the node list of the neighbors meta-message. If it has, it sends a copy of the message. When a node receives a message, if the destination of the message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered. Otherwise, the message is stored in the receivers storage for forwarding to the destination. 3.1.3 Multi-node Relay When we use more than two hops to relay a message, each node needs to know the contact probabilities along all possible paths to the message destination. Every node keeps a contact probability matrix, in which each cell pij is a contact probability between to nodes i and j. Each node i computes its own contact probabilities (row i) with other nodes using Equation (5) whenever the node ends a contact with other nodes. Each row of the contact probability matrix has a version number; the version number for row i is only increased when node i updates the matrix entries in row i. Other matrix entries are updated through exchange with other nodes when they meet. When two nodes i and j meet, they first exchange their contact probability matrices. Node i compares its own contact matrix with node js matrix. If node js matrix has a row l with a higher version number, then node i replaces its own row l with node js row l. Likewise node j updates its matrix. After the exchange, the two nodes will have identical contact probability matrices. Next, if a node has a message to forward, the node estimates its neighboring nodes order-k contact probability to contact the destination of the message using Equation (6). If p (k) ij is above a threshold, or if j is the destination of the message, node i will send a copy of the message to node j. All the above effort serves to determine the transfer probability when two nodes meet. The replication decision is orthogonal to the transfer decision. In our implementation, we always replicate. Although PRoPHET [16] and Link-State [22] do no replication, as described, we added replication to those protocols for better comparison to our protocol. 4. EVALUATION RESULTS We evaluate and compare the results of direct delivery, epidemic, random, PRoPHET, Link-State, and timely-contact routing protocols. 4.1 Mobility traces We use real mobility data collected at Dartmouth College. Dartmouth College has collected association and disassociation messages from devices on its wireless network wireless users since spring 2001 [13]. Each message records the wireless card MAC address, the time of association/disassociation, and the name of the access point. We treat each unique MAC address as a node. For 37 more information about Dartmouths network and the data collection, see previous studies [7, 12]. Our data are not contacts in a mobile ad-hoc network. We can approximate contact traces by assuming that two users can communicate with each other whenever they are associated with the same access point. Chaintreau et al. [5] used Dartmouth data traces and made the same assumption to theoretically analyze the impact of human mobility on opportunistic forwarding algorithms. This assumption may not be accurate,2 but it is a good first approximation. In our simulation, we imagine the same clients and same mobility in a network with no access points. Since our campus has full WiFi coverage, we assume that the location of access points had little impact on users mobility. We simulated one full month of trace data (November 2003) taken from CRAWDAD [13], with 5, 142 users. Although predictionbased protocols require prior contact history to estimate each nodes delivery probability, our preliminary results show that the performance improvement of warming-up over one month of trace was marginal. Therefore, for simplicity, we show the results of all protocols without warming-up. 4.2 Simulator We developed a custom simulator.3 Since we used contact traces derived from real mobility data, we did not need a mobility model and omitted physical and link-layer details for node discovery. We were aware that the time for neighbor discovery in different wireless technologies vary from less than one seconds to several seconds. Furthermore, connection establishment also takes time, such as DHCP. In our simulation, we assumed the nodes could discover and connect each other instantly when they were associated with a same AP. To accurately model communication costs, however, we simulated some MAC-layer behaviors, such as collision. The default settings of the network of our simulator are listed in Table 1, using the values recommended by other papers [22, 16]. The message probability was the probability of generating messages, as described in Section 4.3. The default transmission bandwidth was 11 Mb/s. When one node tried to transmit a message, it first checked whether any nearby node was transmitting. If it was, the node backed off a random number of slots. Each slot was 1 millisecond, and the maximum number of backoff slots was 30. The size of messages was uniformly distributed between 80 bytes and 1024 bytes. The hop count limit (HCL) was the maximum number of hops before a message should stop forwarding. The time to live (TTL) was the maximum duration that a message may exist before expiring. The storage capacity was the maximum space that a node can use for storing messages. For our routing method, we used a default prediction window ΔT of 10 hours and a probability threshold of 0.01. The replication factor r was not limited by default, so the source of a message transferred the messages to any other node that had a contact probability with the message destination higher than the probability threshold. 4.3 Message generation After each contact event in the contact trace, we generated a message with a given probability; we choose a source node and a des2 Two nodes may not have been able to directly communicate while they were at two far sides of an access point, or two nodes may have been able to directly communicate if they were between two adjacent access points. 3 We tried to use a general network simulator (ns2), which was extremely slow when simulating a large number of mobile nodes (in our case, more than 5000 nodes), and provided unnecessary detail in modeling lower-level network protocols. Table 1: Default Settings of the Simulation Parameter Default value message probability 0.001 bandwidth 11 Mb/s transmission slot 1 millisecond max backoff slots 30 message size 80-1024 bytes hop count limit (HCL) unlimited time to live (TTL) unlimited storage capacity unlimited prediction window ΔT 10 hours probability threshold 0.01 contact history length 20 replication always aging factor α 0.9 (0.98 PRoPHET) initial probability p0 0.75 (PRoPHET) transitivity impact β 0.25 (PRoPHET) 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 0 5 10 15 20 Numberofoccurrence hour movements contacts Figure 1: Movements and contacts duration each hour tination node randomly using a uniform distribution across nodes seen in the contact trace up to the current time. When there were more contacts during a certain period, there was a higher likelihood that a new message was generated in that period. This correlation is not unreasonable, since there were more movements during the day than during the night, and so the number of contacts. Figure 1 shows the statistics of the numbers of movements and the numbers of contacts during each hour of the day, summed across all users and all days. The plot shows a clear diurnal activity pattern. The activities reached lowest around 5am and peaked between 4pm and 5pm. We assume that in some applications, network traffic exhibits similar patterns, that is, people send more messages during the day, too. Messages expire after a TTL. We did not use proactive methods to notify nodes the delivery of messages, so that the messages can be removed from storage. 4.4 Metrics We define a set of metrics that we use in evaluating routing protocols in opportunistic networks: • delivery ratio, the ratio of the number of messages delivered to the number of total messages generated. • message transmissions, the total number of messages transmitted during the simulation across all nodes. 38 • meta-data transmissions, the total number of meta-data units transmitted during the simulation across all nodes. • message duplications, the number of times a message copy occurred, due to replication. • delay, the duration between a messages generation time and the messages delivery time. • storage usage, the max and mean of maximum storage (bytes) used across all nodes. 4.5 Results Here we compare simulation results of the six routing protocols. 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 unlimited 100 24 10 1 Deliveryratio Message time-to-live (TTL) (hour) direct random prediction state prophet epidemic Figure 2: Delivery ratio (log scale). The direct and random protocols for one-hour TTL had delivery ratios that were too low to be visible in the plot. Figure 2 shows the delivery ratio of all the protocols, with different TTLs. (In all the plots in the paper, prediction stands for our method, state stands for the Link-State protocol, and prophet represents PRoPHET.) Although we had 5,142 users in the network, the direct-delivery and random protocols had low delivery ratios (note the log scale). Even for messages with an unlimited lifetime, only 59 out of 2077 messages were delivered during this one-month simulation. The delivery ratio of epidemic routing was the best. The three prediction-based approaches had low delivery ratio, compared to epidemic routing. Although our method was slightly better than the other two, the advantage was marginal. The high delivery ratio of epidemic routing came with a price: excessive transmissions. Figure 3 shows the number of message data transmissions. The number of message transmissions of epidemic routing was more than 10 times higher than for the predictionbased routing protocols. Obviously, the direct delivery protocol had the lowest number of message transmissions - the number of message delivered. Among the three prediction-based methods, the PRoPHET transmitted fewer messages, but had comparable delivery-ratio as seen in Figure 2. Figure 4 shows that epidemic and all prediction-based methods had substantial meta-data transmissions, though epidemic routing had relatively more, with shorter TTLs. Because epidemic protocol transmitted messages at every contact, in turn, more nodes had messages that required meta-data transmission during contact. The direct-delivery and random protocols had no meta-data transmissions. In addition to its message transmissions and meta-data transmissions, the epidemic routing protocol also had excessive message 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 unlimited 100 24 10 1 Numberofmessagetransmitted Message time-to-live (TTL) (hour) direct random prediction state prophet epidemic Figure 3: Message transmissions (log scale) 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 unlimited 100 24 10 1 Numberofmeta-datatransmissions Message time-to-live (TTL) (hour) direct random prediction state prophet epidemic Figure 4: Meta-data transmissions (log scale). Direct and random protocols had no meta-data transmissions. duplications, spreading replicas of messages over the network. Figure 5 shows that epidemic routing had one or two orders more duplication than the prediction-based protocols. Recall that the directdelivery and random protocols did not replicate, thus had no data duplications. Figure 6 shows both the median and mean delivery delays. All protocols show similar delivery delays in both mean and median measures for medium TTLs, but differ for long and short TTLs. With a 100-hour TTL, or unlimited TTL, epidemic routing had the shortest delays. The direct-delivery had the longest delay for unlimited TTL, but it had the shortest delay for the one-hour TTL. The results seem contrary to our intuition: the epidemic routing protocol should be the fastest routing protocol since it spreads messages all over the network. Indeed, the figures show only the delay time for delivered messages. For direct delivery, random, and the probability-based routing protocols, relatively few messages were delivered for short TTLs, so many messages expired before they could reach their destination; those messages had infinite delivery delay and were not included in the median or mean measurements. For longer TTLs, more messages were delivered even for the directdelivery protocol. The statistics of longer TTLs for comparison are more meaningful than those of short TTLs. Since our message generation rate was low, the storage usage was also low in our simulation.

The epidemic routing had the most storage usage. The message time-to-live parameter was the big factor affecting the storage usage for epidemic and prediction-based routing protocols. We studied the impact of different parameters of our predictionbased routing protocol. Our prediction-based protocol was sensitive to several parameters, such as the probability threshold and the prediction window ΔT. Figure 8 shows the delivery ratios when we used different probability thresholds. (The leftmost value 0.01 is the value used for the other plots.) A higher probability threshold limited the transfer probability, so fewer messages were delivered. It also required fewer transmissions as shown in Figure 9. With a larger prediction window, we got a higher contact probability. Thus, for the same probability threshold, we had a slightly higher delivery ratio as shown in Figure 10, and a few more transmissions as shown in Figure 11. 5. RELATED WORK In addition to the protocols that we evaluated in our simulation, several other opportunistic network routing protocols have been proposed in the literature. We did not implement and evaluate these routing protocols, because either they require domain-specific information (location information) [14, 15], assume certain mobility patterns [17], present orthogonal approaches [10, 24] to other routing protocols. 0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000 unlimited100 24 10 1 unlimited100 24 10 1 Storageusage(KB) Message time-to-live (TTL) (hour) direct random prediction state prophet epidemic Mean of maximumMax of maximum Figure 7: Max and mean of maximum storage usage across all nodes (log scale). 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Deliveryratio Probability threshold Figure 8: Probability threshold impact on delivery ratio of timely-contact routing. LeBrun et al. [14] propose a location-based delay-tolerant network routing protocol. Their algorithm assumes that every node knows its own position, and the destination is stationary at a known location. A node forwards data to a neighbor only if the neighbor is closer to the destination than its own position. Our protocol does not require knowledge of the nodes locations, and learns their contact patterns. Leguay et al. [15] use a high-dimensional space to represent a mobility pattern, then routes messages to nodes that are closer to the destination node in the mobility pattern space. Location information of nodes is required to construct mobility patterns. Musolesi et al. [17] propose an adaptive routing protocol for intermittently connected mobile ad-hoc networks. They use a Kalman filter to compute the probability that a node delivers messages. This protocol assumes group mobility and cloud connectivity, that is, nodes move as a group, and among this group of nodes a contemporaneous end-to-end connection exists for every pair of nodes. When two nodes are in the same connected cloud, DSDV [19] routing is used. Network coding also draws much interest from DTN research. Erasure-coding [10, 24] explores coding algorithms to reduce message replicas. The source node replicates a message m times, then uses a coding scheme to encode them in one big message.

If m of the blocks are received at the destination, the message can be restored, where m < k. In a uniformly distributed mobility scenario, the delivery probability increases because the probability that the destination node meets m relays is greater than it meets k relays, given m < k. 6. SUMMARY We propose a prediction-based routing protocol for opportunistic networks. We evaluate the performance of our protocol using realistic contact traces, and compare to five existing routing protocols. Our simulation results show that direct delivery had the lowest delivery ratio, the fewest data transmissions, and no meta-data transmission or data duplication. Direct delivery is suitable for devices that require an extremely low power consumption. The random protocol increased the chance of delivery for messages otherwise stuck at some low mobility nodes. Epidemic routing delivered the most messages. The excessive transmissions, and data duplication, however, consume more resources than portable devices may be able to provide. None of these protocols (direct-delivery, random and epidemic routing) are practical for real deployment of opportunistic networks, 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 Numberofmessagetransmitted(million) Prediction window (hour) Figure 11: Prediction window impact on message transmission of timely-contact routing (semi-log scale). because they either had an extremely low delivery ratio, or had an extremely high resource consumption. The prediction-based routing protocols had a delivery ratio more than 10 times better than that for direct-delivery and random routing, and fewer transmissions and less storage usage than epidemic routing. They also had fewer data duplications than epidemic routing. All the prediction-based routing protocols that we have evaluated had similar performance. Our method had a slightly higher delivery ratio, but more transmissions and higher storage usage. There are many parameters for prediction-based routing protocols, however, and different parameters may produce different results. Indeed, there is an opportunity for some adaptation; for example, high priority messages may be given higher transfer and replication probabilities to increase the chance of delivery and reduce the delay, or a node with infrequent contact may choose to raise its transfer probability. We only studied the impact of predicting peer-to-peer contact probability for routing in unicast messages. In some applications, context information (such as location) may be available for the peers. One may also consider other messaging models, for example, where messages are sent to a location, such that every node at that location will receive a copy of the message. Location prediction [21] may be used to predict nodes mobility, and to choose as relays those nodes moving toward the destined location. Research on routing in opportunistic networks is still in its early stage. Many other issues of opportunistic networks, such as security and privacy, are mainly left open. We anticipate studying these issues in future work. 7.

Kotz Instituto para Estudios de Tecnología de Seguridad (ISTS) Departamento de Ciencias de la Computación, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, EE. UU. 03755 Resumen de protocolos de enrutamiento de redes móviles móviles (MANET) de EE. UU.Suponga que existen rutas de comunicación de extremo a extremo contemporáneas entre los remitentes de datos y los receptores. En algunas redes ad-hoc móviles con una población de nodo escaso, una ruta de comunicación de extremo a extremo puede romperse con frecuencia o no existir en ningún momento. Se han propuesto muchos protocolos de enrutamiento en la literatura para abordar el problema, pero pocos fueron evaluados en un entorno de red oportunista realista. Utilizamos la simulación y las trazas de contacto (derivadas de los registros en una red de producción) para evaluar y comparar cinco protocolos existentes: entrega directa, epidemia, aleatoria, profeta y estado de enlace, así como nuestro propio protocolo de enrutamiento propuesto. Mostramos que los protocolos de enrutamiento de la entrega directa y la epidemia sufren una baja relación de entrega o un alto uso de recursos, y otros protocolos hacen compensaciones entre la relación entrega y el uso de recursos. Categorías y descriptores de asignaturas c.2.4 [Organización de sistemas informáticos]: Redes de comunicación informática Sistemas distribuidos Términos generales Rendimiento, Diseño 1. Introducción Las redes oportunistas móviles son un tipo de red tolerante a retrasos (DTN) [6]. Las redes tolerantes a los retrasos proporcionan servicio a pesar de los largos retrasos en los enlaces o las frecuentes descansos de enlaces. Los retrasos de enlaces largos ocurren en las redes con comunicación entre nodos a una gran distancia, como las redes interplanetarias [2]. Los saltos de enlace son causados por nodos que se mueven fuera del rango, cambios ambientales, interferencia de otros objetos móviles, apagados de radio o nodos fallidos. Para nosotros, las redes oportunistas móviles son aquellas DTN con población de nodos escasos y descansos frecuentes de enlace causados por apagados y la movilidad de los nodos. Las redes oportunistas móviles han recibido un interés creciente de los investigadores. En la literatura, estas redes incluyen redes de sensores móviles [25], redes de seguimiento de animales salvajes [11], redes de bolsillo [8] y redes de transporte [1, 14]. Esperamos ver redes más oportunistas cuando el proyecto One Laptopper-Child (OLPC) [18] comience a implementar computadoras portátiles de bajo costo con capacidad de red inalámbrica para niños en países en desarrollo, donde a menudo no hay salidas de infraestructura. La creación de redes oportunistas es un enfoque prometedor para que esos niños intercambien información. Un problema fundamental en las redes oportunistas es cómo enrutar los mensajes de su fuente a su destino. Las redes oportunistas móviles difieren de Internet, ya que las desconexiones son la norma en lugar de la excepción. En las redes oportunistas móviles, los dispositivos de comunicación pueden ser transportados por personas [4], vehículos [1] o animales [11]. Algunos dispositivos pueden formar una pequeña red ad-hoc móvil cuando los nodos se acercan entre sí. Pero un nodo puede aislarse con frecuencia de otros nodos. Tenga en cuenta que los protocolos tradicionales de enrutamiento de Internet y los protocolos de enrutamiento ad-hoc, como AODV [20] o DSDV [19], suponga que existe una ruta final contemporánea de extremo y, por lo tanto, fallan en las redes oportunistas móviles. De hecho, puede que nunca haya una ruta de extremo a extremo entre dos dispositivos dados. En este documento, estudiamos protocolos para enrutamiento de mensajes entre dispositivos de red inalámbricos transportados por personas. Asumimos que las personas envían mensajes a otras personas ocasionalmente, usando sus dispositivos;Cuando no existe un enlace directo entre la fuente y el destino del mensaje, otros nodos pueden transmitir el mensaje al destino. Cada dispositivo representa a una persona única (está fuera del alcance de este documento cuando un dispositivo tal vez llevado por varias personas). Cada mensaje está destinado a una persona específica y, por lo tanto, para un nodo específico transportado por esa persona. Aunque una persona puede llevar múltiples dispositivos, suponemos que el remitente sabe qué dispositivo es el mejor para recibir el mensaje. No consideramos multidifusión o geocast en este documento. Se han propuesto muchos protocolos de enrutamiento en la literatura. Pocos de ellos fueron evaluados en configuraciones de red realistas, o incluso en simulaciones realistas, debido a la falta de cualquier modelo realista de movilidad de personas. Los modelos de movilidad aleatoria de caminata o punto de camino aleatorio a menudo se utilizan para evaluar el rendimiento de esos protocolos de enrutamiento. Aunque estos modelos de movilidad sintética han recibido un amplio interés por parte de los investigadores de redes ad-hoc móviles [3], no reflejan los patrones de movilidad de las personas [9]. Al darse cuenta de las limitaciones del uso de modelos de movilidad aleatoria en simulaciones, algunos investigadores han estudiado protocolos de enrutamiento en redes oportunistas móviles con trazas de movilidad realistas. Chaintreau et al.[5] analizó teóricamente el impacto de los algoritmos de enrutamiento sobre un modelo derivado de un conjunto de datos de movilidad realista. Su et al.[22] simuló un conjunto de protocolos de enrutamiento 35 en una pequeña red experimental. Esos estudios ayudan a los investigadores a comprender mejor los límites teóricos de las redes oportunistas y el rendimiento del protocolo de enrutamiento en una pequeña red (20-30 nodos). Implementar y experimentar redes oportunistas móviles a gran escala es difícil, también recurrimos a la simulación. En lugar de utilizar un modelo de movilidad complejo para imitar los patrones de movilidad de las personas, utilizamos trazas de movilidad recopiladas en una red inalámbrica de producción en Dartmouth College para impulsar nuestra simulación. Nuestro modelo de Generación de mensajes, sin embargo, era sintético. Hasta donde sabemos, somos los primeros en simular el efecto de los protocolos de enrutamiento en una red oportunista móvil a gran escala, utilizando trazas de contacto realistas derivadas de trazas reales de una red de producción con más de 5,000 usuarios. Usando trazas de contacto realistas, evaluamos el rendimiento de tres protocolos de enrutamiento ingenuo (entrega directa, epidemia y aleatoria) y dos protocolos de enrutamiento basados en predicciones, Profeta [16] y estado de enlace [22]. También proponemos un nuevo protocolo de enrutamiento basado en la predicción y lo comparamos con lo anterior en nuestra evaluación.2. Protocolo de enrutamiento Un protocolo de enrutamiento está diseñado para reenviar mensajes de un nodo (fuente) a otro nodo (destino). Cualquier nodo puede generar mensajes para cualquier otro nodo y puede llevar mensajes destinados a otros nodos. En este documento, consideramos solo mensajes que son unidifusión (destino único). Los protocolos de enrutamiento DTN podrían describirse en parte por su probabilidad de transferencia y probabilidad de replicación;Es decir, cuando un nodo cumple con otro nodo, ¿cuál es la probabilidad de que se transfiera un mensaje y, de ser así, si el remitente debe retener su copia? Dos extremos son el protocolo de entrega directa y el protocolo de epidemia. El primero se transfiere con la probabilidad 1 cuando el nodo cumple con el destino, 0 para otros y sin replicación. Este último utiliza la probabilidad de transferencia 1 para todos los nodos y replicación ilimitada. Ambos protocolos tienen sus ventajas y desventajas. Todos los demás protocolos están entre los dos extremos. Primero, definimos la noción de contacto entre dos nodos. Luego describimos cinco protocolos existentes antes de presentar nuestra propia propuesta. Un contacto se define como un período de tiempo durante el cual dos nodos tienen la oportunidad de comunicarse. Aunque somos conscientes de que las tecnologías inalámbricas difieren, suponemos que un nodo puede detectar de manera confiable el tiempo de inicio y finalización de un contacto con nodos cercanos. Un nodo puede estar en contacto con varios otros nodos al mismo tiempo. El historial de contacto de un nodo es una secuencia de contactos con otros nodos. Nodo I tiene un historial de contacto Hi (J), para el nodo J, que denota los contactos históricos entre el nodo I y el nodo j. Grabamos el tiempo de inicio y finalización para cada contacto;Sin embargo, los últimos contactos en el historial de contacto de los nodos pueden no haber terminado.2.1 Protocolo de entrega directa En este protocolo simple, un mensaje se transmite solo cuando el nodo de origen puede comunicarse directamente con el nodo de destino del mensaje. Sin embargo, en las redes oportunistas móviles, la probabilidad de que el remitente cumpla con el destino puede ser baja, o incluso cero.2.2 Protocolo de enrutamiento epidémico El protocolo de enrutamiento epidémico [23] inunda mensajes a la red. El nodo fuente envía una copia del mensaje a cada nodo que cumple. Los nodos que reciben una copia del mensaje también envían una copia del mensaje a cada nodo que cumplan. Finalmente, una copia del mensaje llega al destino del mensaje. Este protocolo es simple, pero puede usar recursos significativos;La comunicación excesiva puede drenar cada batería de nodos rápidamente. Además, dado que cada nodo mantiene una copia de cada mensaje, el almacenamiento no se usa de manera eficiente, y la capacidad de la red es limitada. Como mínimo, cada nodo debe expirar los mensajes después de una cantidad de tiempo o dejar de reenviarlos después de un cierto número de lúpulo. Después de que expire un mensaje, el mensaje no se transmitirá y se eliminará del almacenamiento de cualquier nodo que contenga el mensaje. Una optimización para reducir el costo de comunicación es transferir mensajes de índice antes de transferir cualquier mensaje de datos. Los mensajes de índice contienen ID de mensajes que actualmente tiene un nodo. Por lo tanto, al examinar los mensajes de índice, un nodo solo transfiere mensajes que aún no están contenidos en los otros nodos.2.3 Enrutamiento aleatorio Un enfoque obvio entre los dos extremos anteriores es seleccionar una probabilidad de transferencia entre 0 y 1 para reenviar mensajes en cada contacto. Utilizamos una estrategia de replicación simple que solo permite que el nodo fuente realice réplicas y limita la replicación a un número específico de copias. El mensaje tiene alguna posibilidad de ser transferido a un nodo altamente móvil y, por lo tanto, puede tener una mejor oportunidad de llegar a su destino antes de que expire el mensaje.2.4 Protocolo Profeta Profeta [16] es un protocolo de enrutamiento probabilístico que utiliza el historial de encuentros pasados y transitividad para estimar cada probabilidad de suministro de nodos para el otro nodo. Cuando el nodo I se encuentra con el nodo J, la probabilidad de entrega del nodo I para J se actualiza por PIJ = (1 - PIJ) P0 + PIJ, (1) donde P0 es una probabilidad inicial, un parámetro de diseño para una red dada. Lindgren et al.[16] eligió 0.75, al igual que nosotros en nuestra evaluación. Cuando el nodo I no cumple con J durante algún tiempo, la probabilidad de entrega disminuye en PIJ = αK PIJ, (2) donde α es el factor de envejecimiento (α <1), y K es el número de unidades de tiempo desde la última actualización. El Protocolo Profeta intercambia mensajes índice, así como probabilidades de entrega. Cuando el nodo I recibe probabilidades de entrega JS del nodo, el nodo I puede calcular la probabilidad de entrega transitiva a través de J a Z con Piz = Piz + (1 - Piz) Pijpjzβ, (3) donde β es un parámetro de diseño para el impacto de la transitividad;Usamos β = 0.25 al igual que Lindgren [16].2.5 Protocolo de estado de enlace Su et al.[22] Use un enfoque de estado de enlace para estimar el peso de cada ruta desde la fuente de un mensaje hasta el destino. Utilizan la duración mediana entre contacto o la duración intercontact envejecida exponencialmente como el peso en los enlaces. La duración entre contacto exponencialmente envejecida del nodo I y J se calcula mediante WIJ = αWIJ + (1-α) I, (4) donde I es la nueva duración entre contacto y α es el factor de envejecimiento. Los nodos comparten sus pesos en estado de enlace cuando pueden comunicarse entre sí, y los mensajes se envían al nodo que tienen la ruta con el peso de estado de enlace más bajo.36 3. Probabilidad de contacto oportuno También utilizamos información de contacto histórica para estimar la probabilidad de cumplir con otros nodos en el futuro. Pero nuestro método difiere en que estimamos la probabilidad de contacto dentro de un período de tiempo. Por ejemplo, ¿cuál es la probabilidad de contacto en la próxima hora? Ni el profeta ni el estado de enlace consideran el tiempo de esta manera. Una forma de estimar la probabilidad de contacto oportuno es utilizar la relación de la duración total de contacto hasta el tiempo total. Sin embargo, este enfoque no captura la frecuencia de los contactos. Por ejemplo, un nodo puede tener un contacto largo con otro nodo, seguido de un período largo sin contacto. Un tercer nodo puede tener un contacto corto con el primer nodo, seguido de un período corto sin contacto. Usando el enfoque de estimación anterior, ambos ejemplos tendrían una probabilidad de contacto similar. En el segundo ejemplo, sin embargo, los dos nodos tienen contactos más frecuentes. Diseñamos un método para capturar la frecuencia de contacto de los nodos móviles. Para este propósito, suponemos que incluso los contactos cortos son suficientes para intercambiar mensajes.1 La probabilidad de nodo I para cumplir con el nodo J se calcula mediante el siguiente procedimiento. Dividamos el historial de contacto HI (J) en una secuencia de N períodos de ΔT a partir de la hora de inicio (T0) del primer contacto en la historia HI (J) hasta la hora actual. Numeramos cada uno de los N períodos de 0 a N - 1, luego verificamos cada período. Si el nodo, tuve algún contacto con el nodo J durante un período dado m, que es [T0 + MΔT, T0 + (m + 1) Δt), establecemos que el estado de contacto IM sea 1;De lo contrario, el estado de contacto IM es 0. La probabilidad p (0) ij ese nodo I se encuentra con el nodo J en el siguiente ΔT puede estimarse como el promedio del estado de contacto en intervalos anteriores: P (0) ij = 1 n n - 1x m = 0 im.(5) para adaptarse al cambio de patrones de contacto y reducir el espacio de almacenamiento para historias de contacto, un nodo puede descartar contactos de antecedentes antiguos;En esta situación, la estimación se basaría solo en la historia retenida. La probabilidad anterior es la probabilidad de contacto directo de dos nodos. También estamos interesados en la probabilidad de que podamos transmitir un mensaje a través de una secuencia de K nodos. Definimos la probabilidad de orden k inductivamente, p (k) ij = p (0) ij + x α p (0) iα p (k-1) αJ, (6) donde α es cualquier nodo que no sea i o j.3.1 Nuestro protocolo de enrutamiento primero consideramos el caso de una ruta de dos saltos, es decir, con solo un nodo de relé. Consideramos dos enfoques: el vecino receptor decide si actuar como relé o la fuente decide qué vecinos usar como relé.3.1.1 Decisión del receptor Cada vez que un nodo cumple con otros nodos, intercambian todos sus mensajes (o como anteriormente, mensajes de índice). Si el destino de un mensaje es el receptor en sí, el mensaje se entrega. De lo contrario, si la probabilidad de entregar el mensaje a su destino a través de este nodo receptor dentro de ΔT es mayor o igual a un cierto umbral, el mensaje se almacena en el almacenamiento de los receptores para reenviar 1 en nuestra simulación, sin embargo, modelamos con precisión la comunicación de comunicación.Los costos y algunos contactos breves no tendrán éxito en la transferencia de todos los mensajes.al destino. Si la probabilidad es menor que el umbral, el receptor descarta el mensaje. Observe que nuestro protocolo replica el mensaje cada vez que aparezca un relé atractivo.3.1.2 Decisión del remitente Para tomar decisiones, un remitente debe tener la información sobre la probabilidad de contacto de sus vecinos con un destino de mensajes. Por lo tanto, el intercambio de metadatos es necesario. Cuando dos nodos se encuentran, intercambian un metade-mensaje, que contiene una lista desordenada de ID de nodo para las cuales el remitente del metamesaje tiene una probabilidad de contacto mayor que el umbral. Después de recibir un meta-mensaje, un nodo verifica si tiene algún mensaje destinado a su vecino, o a un nodo en la lista de nodos del meta-mensaje de los vecinos. Si es así, envía una copia del mensaje. Cuando un nodo recibe un mensaje, si el destino del mensaje es el receptor en sí, se entrega el mensaje. De lo contrario, el mensaje se almacena en el almacenamiento de los receptores para reenviar al destino.3.1.3 Relé de nodos múltiples Cuando usamos más de dos lúpulos para transmitir un mensaje, cada nodo necesita conocer las probabilidades de contacto a lo largo de todas las rutas posibles al destino del mensaje. Cada nodo mantiene una matriz de probabilidad de contacto, en la que cada celda PIJ es una probabilidad de contacto entre los nodos I y J. Cada nodo I calcula sus propias probabilidades de contacto (fila I) con otros nodos usando la ecuación (5) cada vez que el nodo finaliza un contacto con otros nodos. Cada fila de la matriz de probabilidad de contacto tiene un número de versión;El número de versión para la fila I solo aumenta cuando el nodo I actualiza las entradas de matriz en la fila i. Otras entradas de matriz se actualizan a través del intercambio con otros nodos cuando se encuentran. Cuando dos nodos yo y J se encuentran, primero intercambian sus matrices de probabilidad de contacto. El nodo I compara su propia matriz de contacto con la matriz JS del nodo. Si Node JS Matrix tiene una fila L con un número de versión más alto, entonces el nodo I reemplaza su propia fila L con el nodo JS fila l.Del mismo modo, Node J actualiza su matriz. Después del intercambio, los dos nodos tendrán matrices de probabilidad de contacto idénticas. A continuación, si un nodo tiene un mensaje para reenviar, el nodo estima que su probabilidad de contacto de los nodos vecinos de los nodos-K para contactar al destino del mensaje utilizando la ecuación (6). Si p (k) ij está por encima de un umbral, o si j es el destino del mensaje, el nodo enviaré una copia del mensaje al nodo j. Todo el esfuerzo anterior sirve para determinar la probabilidad de transferencia cuando se encuentran dos nodos. La decisión de replicación es ortogonal a la decisión de transferencia. En nuestra implementación, siempre replicamos. Aunque el Profeta [16] y el estado de enlace [22] no hacen replicación, como se describe, agregamos replicación a esos protocolos para una mejor comparación con nuestro protocolo.4. Resultados de la evaluación Evaluamos y comparamos los resultados de los protocolos de enrutamiento directo de entrega, epidemia, aleatoria, profeta, estado de enlace y contacto oportuno.4.1 Rastros de movilidad Utilizamos datos de movilidad real recopilados en Dartmouth College. Dartmouth College ha recopilado mensajes de asociación y disociación de dispositivos en sus usuarios inalámbricos de red inalámbrica desde la primavera de 2001 [13]. Cada mensaje registra la dirección MAC de la tarjeta inalámbrica, el momento de asociación/disociación y el nombre del punto de acceso. Tratamos cada dirección MAC única como un nodo. Para 37 información más sobre Dartmouths Network y la recopilación de datos, consulte Estudios anteriores [7, 12]. Nuestros datos no son contactos en una red ad-hoc móvil. Podemos aproximar las trazas de contacto asumiendo que dos usuarios pueden comunicarse entre sí cuando están asociados con el mismo punto de acceso. Chaintreau et al.[5] usó trazas de datos de Dartmouth e hizo la misma suposición para analizar teóricamente el impacto de la movilidad humana en los algoritmos de reenvío oportunistas. Esta suposición puede no ser precisa, 2 pero es una buena primera aproximación. En nuestra simulación, imaginamos a los mismos clientes y la misma movilidad en una red sin puntos de acceso. Dado que nuestro campus tiene cobertura WiFi completa, suponemos que la ubicación de los puntos de acceso tuvo poco impacto en la movilidad de los usuarios. Simulamos un mes completo de datos de rastreo (noviembre de 2003) tomado de Crawdad [13], con 5, 142 usuarios. Aunque los protocolos basados en la predicción requieren un historial de contacto previo para estimar la probabilidad de entrega de cada nodo, nuestros resultados preliminares muestran que la mejora del rendimiento del calentamiento durante un mes de rastreo fue marginal. Por lo tanto, por simplicidad, mostramos los resultados de todos los protocolos sin calentar.4.2 Simulador Desarrollamos un simulador personalizado.3 Dado que utilizamos trazas de contacto derivadas de datos de movilidad real, no necesitamos un modelo de movilidad y omitimos los detalles físicos y de la capa de enlace para el descubrimiento de nodos. Somos conscientes de que el tiempo para el descubrimiento de vecinos en diferentes tecnologías inalámbricas varía de menos de un segundo a varios segundos. Además, el establecimiento de conexión también lleva tiempo, como DHCP. En nuestra simulación, asumimos que los nodos podían descubrir y conectarse entre sí al instante cuando estaban asociados con un mismo AP. Sin embargo, para modelar con precisión los costos de comunicación, simulamos algunos comportamientos de la capa Mac, como la colisión. La configuración predeterminada de la red de nuestro simulador se enumera en la Tabla 1, utilizando los valores recomendados por otros documentos [22, 16]. La probabilidad del mensaje fue la probabilidad de generar mensajes, como se describe en la Sección 4.3. El ancho de banda de transmisión predeterminado fue de 11 MB/s. Cuando un nodo intentó transmitir un mensaje, primero verificó si algún nodo cercano estaba transmitiendo. Si lo fuera, el nodo respaldó un número aleatorio de ranuras. Cada ranura era de 1 milisegundo, y el número máximo de ranuras de fondo fue de 30. El tamaño de los mensajes se distribuyó uniformemente entre 80 bytes y 1024 bytes. El límite de conteo de lúpulo (HCL) fue el número máximo de lúpulo antes de que un mensaje dejara de reenviar. El tiempo para vivir (TTL) fue la duración máxima que puede existir un mensaje antes de expirar. La capacidad de almacenamiento fue el espacio máximo que un nodo puede usar para almacenar mensajes. Para nuestro método de enrutamiento, utilizamos una ventana de predicción predeterminada de 10 horas y un umbral de probabilidad de 0.01. El factor de replicación R no estaba limitado de forma predeterminada, por lo que la fuente de un mensaje transfirió los mensajes a cualquier otro nodo que tuviera una probabilidad de contacto con el destino del mensaje más alto que el umbral de probabilidad.4.3 Generación de mensajes Después de cada evento de contacto en la traza de contacto, generamos un mensaje con una probabilidad dada;Elegimos un nodo de origen y un Dos nodos DES2 puede no haber podido comunicarse directamente mientras estaban en dos lados lejanos de un punto de acceso, o dos nodos pueden haber podido comunicarse directamente si estaban entre dos puntos de acceso adyacentes.3 Intentamos usar un simulador de red general (NS2), que fue extremadamente lento al simular una gran cantidad de nodos móviles (en nuestro caso, más de 5000 nodos), y proporcionó detalles innecesarios en el modelado de protocolos de red de nivel inferior. Tabla 1: Configuración predeterminada del parámetro de simulación Valor predeterminado Probabilidad del mensaje 0.001 ancho de banda 11 MB/s Slot de transmisión 1 Millisegund Max Backoff Slots 30 Mensaje Tamaño de mensaje 80-1024 Bytes Límite de conteo de lúpulo (HCL) Tiempo ilimitado para vivir (TTL) Capacidad de almacenamiento ilimitada INUMBRE INIMITEDVentana de predicción Δt 10 horas Umbral de probabilidad 0.01 Longitud del historial de contacto 20 Replicación Siempre factor de envejecimiento α 0.9 (0.98 Profeta) Probabilidad inicial P0 0.75 (Profeta) Impacto de transitividad β 0.25 (Profeta) 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 0 5 15 10 20 Número de hora del país CuraciónContactos de movimientos Figura 1: Movimientos y contactos Duración Cada nodo de tination de hora al azar utilizando una distribución uniforme entre los nodos que se ven en el rastro de contacto hasta la hora actual. Cuando hubo más contactos durante un cierto período, hubo una mayor probabilidad de que se generara un nuevo mensaje en ese período. Esta correlación no es irrazonable, ya que hubo más movimientos durante el día que durante la noche, por lo que el número de contactos. La Figura 1 muestra las estadísticas de los números de movimientos y el número de contactos durante cada hora del día, sumados en todos los usuarios y todos los días. La trama muestra un claro patrón de actividad diurna. Las actividades alcanzaron las más bajas alrededor de las 5 a.m. y alcanzaron su punto máximo entre las 4 p.m. y las 5 p.m. Suponemos que en algunas aplicaciones, el tráfico de red exhibe patrones similares, es decir, las personas también envían más mensajes durante el día. Los mensajes caducan después de un TTL. No utilizamos métodos proactivos para notificar a los nodos la entrega de mensajes, de modo que los mensajes se puedan eliminar del almacenamiento.4.4 Métricas Definimos un conjunto de métricas que utilizamos para evaluar los protocolos de enrutamiento en redes oportunistas: • relación de entrega, la relación del número de mensajes entregados al número de mensajes totales generados.• Transmisiones de mensajes, el número total de mensajes transmitidos durante la simulación en todos los nodos.38 • Transmisiones de metadatos, el número total de unidades de metadatos transmitidas durante la simulación en todos los nodos.• Duplicaciones de mensajes, el número de veces que ocurrió una copia de mensaje, debido a la replicación.• Retrasar, la duración entre un tiempo de generación de mensajes y el tiempo de entrega de mensajes.• El uso de almacenamiento, el máximo y la media de almacenamiento máximo (bytes) utilizado en todos los nodos.4.5 Resultados Aquí comparamos los resultados de la simulación de los seis protocolos de enrutamiento.0.001 0.01 0.1 1 Unlimited 100 24 10 1 Entrewratio Mensaje Tiempo de vida (TTL) (Hora) Estado de predicción aleatoria directa Profeta Epidemia Figura 2: relación de entrega (escala logarítmica). Los protocolos directos y aleatorios para TTL de una hora tenían relaciones de entrega que eran demasiado bajas para ser visibles en la parcela. La Figura 2 muestra la relación de entrega de todos los protocolos, con diferentes TTL.(En todas las gráficas en el documento, la predicción representa nuestro método, el estado representa el protocolo de estado de enlace, y el profeta representa el profeta). Aunque teníamos 5,142 usuarios en la red, los protocolos aleatorios y de entrega directa tenían bajas relaciones de entrega (tenga en cuenta la escala de registro). Incluso para mensajes con una vida ilimitada, solo 59 de 2077 mensajes se entregaron durante esta simulación de un mes. La relación de entrega de enrutamiento epidémico fue la mejor. Los tres enfoques basados en la predicción tenían una baja relación de entrega, en comparación con el enrutamiento epidémico. Aunque nuestro método era ligeramente mejor que los otros dos, la ventaja era marginal. La alta relación de entrega de enrutamiento epidémico vino con un precio: transmisiones excesivas. La Figura 3 muestra el número de transmisiones de datos de mensajes. El número de transmisión de mensajes de enrutamiento epidémico fue más de 10 veces mayor que para los protocolos de enrutamiento basados en la predicción. Obviamente, el protocolo de entrega directa tenía el menor número de transmisiones de mensajes: el número de mensajes entregados. Entre los tres métodos basados en predicciones, el Profeta transmitió menos mensajes, pero tenía una relación de entrega comparable como se ve en la Figura 2. La Figura 4 muestra que la epidemia y todos los métodos basados en la predicción tenían transmisiones sustanciales de metadatos, aunque el enrutamiento epidémico tenía relativamente más, con TTL más cortos. Debido a que el protocolo epidémico transmitió mensajes en cada contacto, a su vez, más nodos tenían mensajes que requirieron transmisión de metadatos durante el contacto. Los protocolos aleatorios y de entrega directa no tenían transmisiones meta-data. Además de sus transmisiones de mensajes y transmisiones de metadatos, el protocolo de enrutamiento epidémico también tenía un mensaje excesivo 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1E+06 1E+07 1E+08 INLIMITADO 100 24 10 1 Número de mensajes de mensajería de ascensura(hora) Estado de predicción aleatoria directa Epidemia Profeta Figura 3: Transmisiones de mensajes (escala de registro) 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1E+06 1E+07 1E+08 INLIMITADO 100 24 10 1 Número de meta-datatransmissions Mensaje Tiempo de vida (TTL)(hora) Estado de predicción aleatoria directa Epidemia Profeta Figura 4: Transmisiones de metadatos (escala logarítmica). Los protocolos directos y aleatorios no tenían transmisiones de meta-datos.Duplicaciones, extendiendo réplicas de mensajes a través de la red. La Figura 5 muestra que el enrutamiento epidémico tenía una o dos órdenes más duplicación que los protocolos basados en la predicción. Recuerde que los protocolos directos y aleatorios no se replicaron, por lo que no tenían duplicaciones de datos. La Figura 6 muestra los retrasos medianos y medios de entrega. Todos los protocolos muestran retrasos de entrega similares en medidas medias y medias para TTL medianos, pero difieren para TTL largos y cortos. Con un TTL de 100 horas, o TTL ilimitado, el enrutamiento epidémico tuvo los retrasos más cortos. La entrega directa tuvo el retraso más largo para TTL ilimitado, pero tuvo el retraso más corto para el TTL de una hora. Los resultados parecen contrarios a nuestra intuición: el protocolo de enrutamiento epidémico debería ser el protocolo de enrutamiento más rápido, ya que difunde mensajes en toda la red. De hecho, las cifras muestran solo el tiempo de retraso para los mensajes entregados. Para la entrega directa, al azar y los protocolos de enrutamiento basados en la probabilidad, se entregaron relativamente pocos mensajes para TTL cortos, por lo que muchos mensajes expiraron antes de que pudieran llegar a su destino;Esos mensajes tenían un retraso de entrega infinito y no se incluyeron en las medidas medianas o medias. Para TTL más largos, se entregaron más mensajes incluso para el Protocolo DirectDelivery. Las estadísticas de TTL más largas para la comparación son más significativas que las de los TTL cortos. Dado que nuestra tasa de generación de mensajes fue baja, el uso del almacenamiento también fue bajo en nuestra simulación.

El enrutamiento epidémico tenía el mayor uso de almacenamiento. El parámetro del tiempo de vida de la vida fue el factor importante que afectaba el uso del almacenamiento para los protocolos de enrutamiento basados en la epidemia y la predicción. Estudiamos el impacto de diferentes parámetros de nuestro protocolo de enrutamiento basado en predicción. Nuestro protocolo basado en la predicción fue sensible a varios parámetros, como el umbral de probabilidad y la ventana de predicción ΔT. La Figura 8 muestra las relaciones de entrega cuando utilizamos diferentes umbrales de probabilidad.(El valor más a la izquierda 0.01 es el valor utilizado para las otras gráficas). Un umbral de probabilidad más alto limitó la probabilidad de transferencia, por lo que se entregaron menos mensajes. También requirió menos transmisiones como se muestra en la Figura 9. Con una ventana de predicción más grande, obtuvimos una mayor probabilidad de contacto. Por lo tanto, para el mismo umbral de probabilidad, tuvimos una relación de entrega ligeramente más alta como se muestra en la Figura 10, y algunas transmisiones más como se muestra en la Figura 11. 5. Trabajo relacionado Además de los protocolos que evaluamos en nuestra simulación, se han propuesto varios otros protocolos de enrutamiento de red oportunistas en la literatura. No implementamos y evaluamos estos protocolos de enrutamiento, porque o requieren información específica de dominio (información de ubicación) [14, 15], asumir ciertos patrones de movilidad [17], enfoques ortogonales actuales [10, 24] a otros protocolos de enrutamiento.0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000 Unlimited100 24 10 1 Unlimited100 24 10 1 Almacenamiento (KB) Tiempo de mensaje de mensaje (TTL) (Hora) Estado de predicción aleatoria directa Media epidémica de Profeta de Maximummax de máximo Figura 7: Max y Medio de almacenamiento máximo de almacenamiento máximoUso en todos los nodos (escala de registro).0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 umbral de probabilidad de administración Figura 8: Impacto del umbral de probabilidad en la relación de entrega de enrutamiento de contacto oportuno. LeBrun et al.[14] propone un protocolo de enrutamiento de red tolerante a retrasos basado en la ubicación. Su algoritmo supone que cada nodo conoce su propia posición, y el destino es estacionario en un lugar conocido. Un nodo reenvía datos a un vecino solo si el vecino está más cerca del destino que su propia posición. Nuestro protocolo no requiere conocimiento de las ubicaciones de los nodos y aprende sus patrones de contacto. Leguay et al.[15] use un espacio de alta dimensión para representar un patrón de movilidad, luego enruta los mensajes a los nodos que están más cerca del nodo de destino en el espacio del patrón de movilidad. Se requiere información de ubicación de los nodos para construir patrones de movilidad. Musolesi et al.[17] proponer un protocolo de enrutamiento adaptativo para redes ad-hoc móviles conectadas intermitentemente. Utilizan un filtro Kalman para calcular la probabilidad de que un nodo entregue mensajes. Este protocolo asume la movilidad del grupo y la conectividad en la nube, es decir, los nodos se mueven como un grupo, y entre este grupo de nodos existe una conexión contemporánea de extremo a extremo para cada par de nodos. Cuando dos nodos están en la misma nube conectada, se utiliza el enrutamiento DSDV [19]. La codificación de red también atrae mucho interés de la investigación de DTN. La codificación de borrado [10, 24] explora los algoritmos de codificación para reducir las réplicas de mensajes. El nodo de origen replica un mensaje M veces, luego usa un esquema de codificación para codificarlos en un gran mensaje. Después de codificar las réplicas, la fuente divide el mensaje grande en K 40 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 0 0.2 0.4 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Número de messagetransmitido (millones) Umbral de probabilidad Figura 9: Impacto del umbral de probabilidad en la transmisión del mensaje de la ruta de contacto temporal.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 Ventana de predicción de la entrega (hora) Figura 10: Impacto de la ventana de predicción en la relación de entrega de enrutamiento de contacto oportuno (escala de semi-log).Bloques del mismo tamaño y transmite un bloque a cada uno de los primeros K nodos encontrados. Si se reciben M de los bloques en el destino, el mensaje puede restaurarse, donde m <k.En un escenario de movilidad distribuido uniformemente, la probabilidad de entrega aumenta porque la probabilidad de que el nodo de destino cumpla con los relés M es mayor de lo que cumple con K relés, dado m <k.6. Resumen Proponemos un protocolo de enrutamiento basado en la predicción para redes oportunistas. Evaluamos el rendimiento de nuestro protocolo utilizando trazas de contacto realistas y comparamos con cinco protocolos de enrutamiento existentes. Nuestros resultados de simulación muestran que la entrega directa tuvo la relación de entrega más baja, la menor cantidad de transmisiones de datos y ninguna transmisión de meta-datos o duplicación de datos. La entrega directa es adecuada para dispositivos que requieren un consumo de energía extremadamente bajo. El protocolo aleatorio aumentó la posibilidad de entrega para mensajes atascados en algunos nodos de baja movilidad. El enrutamiento epidémico entregó la mayoría de los mensajes. Sin embargo, las transmisiones excesivas y la duplicación de datos consumen más recursos de los que pueden proporcionar dispositivos portátiles. Ninguno de estos protocolos (entrega directa, enrutamiento aleatorio y epidémico) es práctico para el despliegue real de redes oportunistas, 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 NumberOfMessagetransmited (millones) Ventana de predicción (Hora) Figura 11:Impacto en la transmisión de mensajes de enrutamiento de contacto oportuno (escala de semi-log).Porque tenían una relación de entrega extremadamente baja o tenían un consumo de recursos extremadamente alto. Los protocolos de enrutamiento basados en la predicción tenían una relación de entrega más de 10 veces mejor que la de la entrega directa y el enrutamiento aleatorio, y menos transmisiones y menos uso de almacenamiento que el enrutamiento epidémico. También tenían menos duplicaciones de datos que el enrutamiento de la epidemia. Todos los protocolos de enrutamiento basados en la predicción que hemos evaluado tuvieron un rendimiento similar. Nuestro método tenía una relación de entrega ligeramente más alta, pero más transmisiones y un mayor uso de almacenamiento. Sin embargo, hay muchos parámetros para los protocolos de enrutamiento basados en predicciones, y los diferentes parámetros pueden producir resultados diferentes. De hecho, hay una oportunidad para alguna adaptación;Por ejemplo, los mensajes de alta prioridad pueden recibir más probabilidades de transferencia y replicación para aumentar la posibilidad de entrega y reducir el retraso, o un nodo con contacto poco frecuente puede optar por aumentar su probabilidad de transferencia. Solo estudiamos el impacto de predecir la probabilidad de contacto entre pares para el enrutamiento en mensajes de unidifusión. En algunas aplicaciones, la información de contexto (como la ubicación) puede estar disponible para los pares. También se puede considerar otros modelos de mensajería, por ejemplo, donde los mensajes se envían a una ubicación, de modo que cada nodo en esa ubicación reciba una copia del mensaje. La predicción de la ubicación [21] puede usarse para predecir la movilidad de los nodos y para elegir como relés aquellos nodos que se mueven hacia la ubicación destinada. La investigación sobre el enrutamiento en redes oportunistas todavía está en su etapa inicial. Muchos otros problemas de redes oportunistas, como la seguridad y la privacidad, se dejan principalmente abiertos. Anticipamos estudiar estos temas en el trabajo futuro.7.

        "For us, mobile opportunistic networks are those DTNs with sparse node population and frequent link breaks caused by power-offs and the mobility of the nodes.",
        "Mobile opportunistic networks have received increasing interest from researchers.",
        "In the literature, these networks include mobile sensor networks [25], wild-animal tracking networks [11], pocketswitched networks [8], and transportation networks [1, 14].",
        "We expect to see more opportunistic networks when the one-laptopper-child (OLPC) project [18] starts rolling out inexpensive laptops with wireless networking capability for children in developing countries, where often no infrastructure exits.",
        "Opportunistic networking is one promising approach for those children to exchange information.",

        "Mobile opportunistic networks differ from the Internet in that disconnections are the norm instead of the exception.",
        "In mobile opportunistic networks, communication devices can be carried by people [4], vehicles [1] or animals [11].",

        "But a node may frequently be isolated from other nodes.",
        "Note that traditional Internet routing protocols and ad-hoc routing protocols, such as AODV [20] or DSDV [19], assume that a contemporaneous endto-end path exists, and thus fail in mobile opportunistic networks.",
        "Indeed, there may never exist an end-to-end path between two given devices.",
        "In this paper, we study protocols for routing messages between wireless networking devices carried by people.",
        "We assume that people send messages to other people occasionally, using their devices; when no direct link exists between the source and the destination of the message, other nodes may relay the message to the destination.",
        "Each device represents a unique person (it is out of the scope of this paper when a device maybe carried by multiple people).",
        "Each message is destined for a specific person and thus for a specific node carried by that person.",
        "Although one person may carry multiple devices, we assume that the sender knows which device is the best to receive the message.",
        "We do not consider multicast or geocast in this paper.",
        "Many routing protocols have been proposed in the literature.",
        "Few of them were evaluated in realistic network settings, or even in realistic simulations, due to the lack of any realistic people mobility model.",
        "Random walk or random way-point mobility models are often used to evaluate the performance of those routing protocols.",
        "Although these synthetic mobility models have received extensive interest by mobile ad-hoc network researchers [3], they do not reflect peoples mobility patterns [9].",
        "Realising the limitations of using random mobility models in simulations, a few researchers have studied routing protocols in mobile opportunistic networks with realistic mobility traces.",

        "Deploying and experimenting large-scale mobile opportunistic networks is difficult, we too resort to simulation.",
        "Instead of using a complex mobility model to mimic peoples mobility patterns, we used mobility traces collected in a production wireless network at Dartmouth College to drive our simulation.",
        "Our messagegeneration model, however, was synthetic.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simulate the effect of routing protocols in a large-scale mobile opportunistic network, using realistic contact traces derived from real traces of a production network with more than 5, 000 users.",
        "Using realistic contact traces, we evaluate the performance of three naive routing protocols (direct-delivery, epidemic, and random) and two prediction-based routing protocols, PRoPHET [16] and Link-State [22].",
        "We also propose a new prediction-based routing protocol, and compare it to the above in our evaluation. 2.",
        "ROUTING PROTOCOL A routing protocol is designed for forwarding messages from one node (source) to another node (destination).",
        "Any node may generate messages for any other node, and may carry messages destined for other nodes.",
        "In this paper, we consider only messages that are unicast (single destination).",
        "DTN routing protocols could be described in part by their transfer probability and replication probability; that is, when one node meets another node, what is the probability that a message should be transfered and if so, whether the sender should retain its copy.",
        "Two extremes are the direct-delivery protocol and the epidemic protocol.",
        "The former transfers with probability 1 when the node meets the destination, 0 for others, and no replication.",
        "The latter uses transfer probability 1 for all nodes and unlimited replication.",
        "Both these protocols have their advantages and disadvantages.",
        "All other protocols are between the two extremes.",
        "First, we define the notion of contact between two nodes.",
        "Then we describe five existing protocols before presenting our own proposal.",
        "A contact is defined as a period of time during which two nodes have the opportunity to communicate.",
        "Although we are aware that wireless technologies differ, we assume that a node can reliably detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes.",
        "A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time.",
        "The contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other nodes.",
        "Node i has a contact history Hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j.",
        "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
        "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network.",
        "The source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets.",
        "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",
        "Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.",
        "This protocol is simple, but may use significant resources; excessive communication may drain each nodes battery quickly.",
        "Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.",
        "At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.",
        "After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.",
        "An optimization to reduce the communication cost is to transfer index messages before transferring any data message.",
        "The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds.",
        "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
        "We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",
        "The message has some chance of being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires. 2.4 PRoPHET Protocol PRoPHET [16] is a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of past Encounters and Transitivity to estimate each nodes delivery probability for each other node.",
        "When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.",
        "Lindgren et al. [16] chose 0.75, as did we in our evaluation.",
        "When node i does not meet j for some time, the delivery probability decreases by pij = αk pij, (2) where α is the aging factor (α < 1), and k is the number of time units since the last update.",
        "The PRoPHET protocol exchanges index messages as well as delivery probabilities.",
        "When node i receives node js delivery probabilities, node i may compute the transitive delivery probability through j to z with piz = piz + (1 − piz)pijpjzβ, (3) where β is a design parameter for the impact of transitivity; we used β = 0.25 as did Lindgren [16]. 2.5 Link-State Protocol Su et al. [22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination.",
        "They use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged intercontact duration as the weight on links.",
        "The exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)I, (4) where I is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor.",
        "Nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight. 36 3.",
        "TIMELY-CONTACT PROBABILITY We also use historical contact information to estimate the probability of meeting other nodes in the future.",
        "But our method differs in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time.",
        "For example, what is the contact probability in the next hour?",
        "Neither PRoPHET nor Link-State considers time in this way.",
        "One way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the ratio of the total contact duration to the total time.",
        "However, this approach does not capture the frequency of contacts.",
        "For example, one node may have a long contact with another node, followed by a long non-contact period.",
        "A third node may have a short contact with the first node, followed by a short non-contact period.",
        "Using the above estimation approach, both examples would have similar contact probability.",
        "In the second example, however, the two nodes have more frequent contacts.",
        "We design a method to capture the contact frequency of mobile nodes.",
        "For this purpose, we assume that even short contacts are sufficient to exchange messages.1 The probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the following procedure.",

        "We number each of the n periods from 0 to n − 1, then check each period.",
        "If node i had any contact with node j during a given period m, which is [t0 + mΔT, t0 + (m + 1)ΔT), we set the contact status Im to be 1; otherwise, the contact status Im is 0.",

(5) To adapt to the change of contact patterns, and reduce the storage space for contact histories, a node may discard old history contacts; in this situation, the estimate would be based on only the retained history.",

        "We consider two approaches: either the receiving neighbor decides whether to act as a relay, or the source decides which neighbors to use as relay. 3.1.1 Receiver Decision Whenever a node meets other nodes, they exchange all their messages (or as above, index messages).",
        "If the destination of a message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
        "Otherwise, if the probability of delivering the message to its destination through this receiver node within ΔT is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, the message is stored in the receivers storage to forward 1 In our simulation, however, we accurately model the communication costs and some short contacts will not succeed in transfer of all messages. to the destination.",
        "If the probability is less than the threshold, the receiver discards the message.",
        "Notice that our protocol replicates the message whenever a good-looking relay comes along. 3.1.2 Sender Decision To make decisions, a sender must have the information about its neighbors contact probability with a messages destination.",
        "Therefore, meta-data exchange is necessary.",
        "When two nodes meet, they exchange a meta-message, containing an unordered list of node IDs for which the sender of the metamessage has a contact probability greater than the threshold.",
        "After receiving a meta-message, a node checks whether it has any message that destined to its neighbor, or to a node in the node list of the neighbors meta-message.",
        "If it has, it sends a copy of the message.",
        "When a node receives a message, if the destination of the message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
        "Otherwise, the message is stored in the receivers storage for forwarding to the destination. 3.1.3 Multi-node Relay When we use more than two hops to relay a message, each node needs to know the contact probabilities along all possible paths to the message destination.",
        "Every node keeps a contact probability matrix, in which each cell pij is a contact probability between to nodes i and j.",
        "Each node i computes its own contact probabilities (row i) with other nodes using Equation (5) whenever the node ends a contact with other nodes.",
        "Each row of the contact probability matrix has a version number; the version number for row i is only increased when node i updates the matrix entries in row i.",
        "Other matrix entries are updated through exchange with other nodes when they meet.",
        "When two nodes i and j meet, they first exchange their contact probability matrices.",
        "Node i compares its own contact matrix with node js matrix.",
        "If node js matrix has a row l with a higher version number, then node i replaces its own row l with node js row l. Likewise node j updates its matrix.",
        "After the exchange, the two nodes will have identical contact probability matrices.",
        "Next, if a node has a message to forward, the node estimates its neighboring nodes order-k contact probability to contact the destination of the message using Equation (6).",
        "If p (k) ij is above a threshold, or if j is the destination of the message, node i will send a copy of the message to node j.",

        "Our data are not contacts in a mobile ad-hoc network.",
        "We can approximate contact traces by assuming that two users can communicate with each other whenever they are associated with the same access point.",
        "Chaintreau et al. [5] used Dartmouth data traces and made the same assumption to theoretically analyze the impact of human mobility on opportunistic forwarding algorithms.",
        "This assumption may not be accurate,2 but it is a good first approximation.",
        "In our simulation, we imagine the same clients and same mobility in a network with no access points.",
        "Since our campus has full WiFi coverage, we assume that the location of access points had little impact on users mobility.",
        "We simulated one full month of trace data (November 2003) taken from CRAWDAD [13], with 5, 142 users.",
        "Although predictionbased protocols require prior contact history to estimate each nodes delivery probability, our preliminary results show that the performance improvement of warming-up over one month of trace was marginal.",
        "Therefore, for simplicity, we show the results of all protocols without warming-up. 4.2 Simulator We developed a custom simulator.3 Since we used contact traces derived from real mobility data, we did not need a mobility model and omitted physical and link-layer details for node discovery.",
        "We were aware that the time for neighbor discovery in different wireless technologies vary from less than one seconds to several seconds.",
        "Furthermore, connection establishment also takes time, such as DHCP.",
        "In our simulation, we assumed the nodes could discover and connect each other instantly when they were associated with a same AP.",
        "To accurately model communication costs, however, we simulated some MAC-layer behaviors, such as collision.",
        "The default settings of the network of our simulator are listed in Table 1, using the values recommended by other papers [22, 16].",

        "If it was, the node backed off a random number of slots.",
        "Each slot was 1 millisecond, and the maximum number of backoff slots was 30.",
        "The size of messages was uniformly distributed between 80 bytes and 1024 bytes.",

        "The direct and random protocols for one-hour TTL had delivery ratios that were too low to be visible in the plot.",
        "Figure 2 shows the delivery ratio of all the protocols, with different TTLs. (In all the plots in the paper, prediction stands for our method, state stands for the Link-State protocol, and prophet represents PRoPHET.)",
        "Although we had 5,142 users in the network, the direct-delivery and random protocols had low delivery ratios (note the log scale).",
        "Even for messages with an unlimited lifetime, only 59 out of 2077 messages were delivered during this one-month simulation.",
        "The delivery ratio of epidemic routing was the best.",
        "The three prediction-based approaches had low delivery ratio, compared to epidemic routing.",
        "Although our method was slightly better than the other two, the advantage was marginal.",
        "The high delivery ratio of epidemic routing came with a price: excessive transmissions.",
        "Figure 3 shows the number of message data transmissions.",
        "The number of message transmissions of epidemic routing was more than 10 times higher than for the predictionbased routing protocols.",
        "Obviously, the direct delivery protocol had the lowest number of message transmissions - the number of message delivered.",
        "Among the three prediction-based methods, the PRoPHET transmitted fewer messages, but had comparable delivery-ratio as seen in Figure 2.",
        "Figure 4 shows that epidemic and all prediction-based methods had substantial meta-data transmissions, though epidemic routing had relatively more, with shorter TTLs.",
        "Because epidemic protocol transmitted messages at every contact, in turn, more nodes had messages that required meta-data transmission during contact.",

                "Node i has a contact history Hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j.",
                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic <br>routing protocol</br> The epidemic <br>routing protocol</br> [23] floods messages into the network.",
                "The source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets.",
                "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",
                "Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.",
                "This protocol is simple, but may use significant resources; excessive communication may drain each nodes battery quickly.",
                "Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.",
                "At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.",
                "After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.",
                "An optimization to reduce the communication cost is to transfer index messages before transferring any data message.",
                "The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds.",
                "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
                "We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",
                "The message has some chance of being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires. 2.4 PRoPHET Protocol PRoPHET [16] is a Probabilistic <br>routing protocol</br> using History of past Encounters and Transitivity to estimate each nodes delivery probability for each other node.",
                "When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.",
                "Lindgren et al. [16] chose 0.75, as did we in our evaluation.",
                "When node i does not meet j for some time, the delivery probability decreases by pij = αk pij, (2) where α is the aging factor (α < 1), and k is the number of time units since the last update.",
                "The PRoPHET protocol exchanges index messages as well as delivery probabilities.",
                "When node i receives node js delivery probabilities, node i may compute the transitive delivery probability through j to z with piz = piz + (1 − piz)pijpjzβ, (3) where β is a design parameter for the impact of transitivity; we used β = 0.25 as did Lindgren [16]. 2.5 Link-State Protocol Su et al. [22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination.",
                "They use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged intercontact duration as the weight on links.",
                "The exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)I, (4) where I is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor.",
                "Nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight. 36 3.",
                "TIMELY-CONTACT PROBABILITY We also use historical contact information to estimate the probability of meeting other nodes in the future.",
                "But our method differs in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time.",
                "For example, what is the contact probability in the next hour?",
                "Neither PRoPHET nor Link-State considers time in this way.",
                "One way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the ratio of the total contact duration to the total time.",
                "However, this approach does not capture the frequency of contacts.",
                "For example, one node may have a long contact with another node, followed by a long non-contact period.",
                "A third node may have a short contact with the first node, followed by a short non-contact period.",
                "Using the above estimation approach, both examples would have similar contact probability.",
                "In the second example, however, the two nodes have more frequent contacts.",
                "We design a method to capture the contact frequency of mobile nodes.",
                "For this purpose, we assume that even short contacts are sufficient to exchange messages.1 The probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the following procedure.",
                "We divide the contact history Hi(j) into a sequence of n periods of ΔT starting from the start time (t0) of the first contact in history Hi(j) to the current time.",
                "We number each of the n periods from 0 to n − 1, then check each period.",
                "If node i had any contact with node j during a given period m, which is [t0 + mΔT, t0 + (m + 1)ΔT), we set the contact status Im to be 1; otherwise, the contact status Im is 0.",
                "The probability p (0) ij that node i meets node j in the next ΔT can be estimated as the average of the contact status in prior intervals: p (0) ij = 1 n n−1X m=0 Im. (5) To adapt to the change of contact patterns, and reduce the storage space for contact histories, a node may discard old history contacts; in this situation, the estimate would be based on only the retained history.",
                "The above probability is the direct contact probability of two nodes.",
                "We are also interested in the probability that we may be able to pass a message through a sequence of k nodes.",
                "We define the k-order probability inductively, p (k) ij = p (0) ij + X α p (0) iα p (k−1) αj , (6) where α is any node other than i or j. 3.1 Our <br>routing protocol</br> We first consider the case of a two-hop path, that is, with only one relay node.",
                "We consider two approaches: either the receiving neighbor decides whether to act as a relay, or the source decides which neighbors to use as relay. 3.1.1 Receiver Decision Whenever a node meets other nodes, they exchange all their messages (or as above, index messages).",
                "If the destination of a message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, if the probability of delivering the message to its destination through this receiver node within ΔT is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, the message is stored in the receivers storage to forward 1 In our simulation, however, we accurately model the communication costs and some short contacts will not succeed in transfer of all messages. to the destination.",
                "If the probability is less than the threshold, the receiver discards the message.",
                "Notice that our protocol replicates the message whenever a good-looking relay comes along. 3.1.2 Sender Decision To make decisions, a sender must have the information about its neighbors contact probability with a messages destination.",
                "Therefore, meta-data exchange is necessary.",
                "When two nodes meet, they exchange a meta-message, containing an unordered list of node IDs for which the sender of the metamessage has a contact probability greater than the threshold.",
                "After receiving a meta-message, a node checks whether it has any message that destined to its neighbor, or to a node in the node list of the neighbors meta-message.",
                "If it has, it sends a copy of the message.",
                "When a node receives a message, if the destination of the message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, the message is stored in the receivers storage for forwarding to the destination. 3.1.3 Multi-node Relay When we use more than two hops to relay a message, each node needs to know the contact probabilities along all possible paths to the message destination.",
                "Every node keeps a contact probability matrix, in which each cell pij is a contact probability between to nodes i and j.",
                "Each node i computes its own contact probabilities (row i) with other nodes using Equation (5) whenever the node ends a contact with other nodes.",
                "Each row of the contact probability matrix has a version number; the version number for row i is only increased when node i updates the matrix entries in row i.",
                "Other matrix entries are updated through exchange with other nodes when they meet.",
                "When two nodes i and j meet, they first exchange their contact probability matrices.",
                "Node i compares its own contact matrix with node js matrix.",
                "If node js matrix has a row l with a higher version number, then node i replaces its own row l with node js row l. Likewise node j updates its matrix.",
                "After the exchange, the two nodes will have identical contact probability matrices.",
                "Next, if a node has a message to forward, the node estimates its neighboring nodes order-k contact probability to contact the destination of the message using Equation (6).",
                "If p (k) ij is above a threshold, or if j is the destination of the message, node i will send a copy of the message to node j.",
                "All the above effort serves to determine the transfer probability when two nodes meet.",
                "The replication decision is orthogonal to the transfer decision.",
                "In our implementation, we always replicate.",
                "Although PRoPHET [16] and Link-State [22] do no replication, as described, we added replication to those protocols for better comparison to our protocol. 4.",

                "In our simulation, we imagine the same clients and same mobility in a network with no access points.",
                "Since our campus has full WiFi coverage, we assume that the location of access points had little impact on users mobility.",

                "Although predictionbased protocols require prior contact history to estimate each nodes delivery probability, our preliminary results show that the performance improvement of warming-up over one month of trace was marginal.",
                "Therefore, for simplicity, we show the results of all protocols without warming-up. 4.2 Simulator We developed a custom simulator.3 Since we used contact traces derived from real mobility data, we did not need a mobility model and omitted physical and link-layer details for node discovery.",
                "We were aware that the time for neighbor discovery in different wireless technologies vary from less than one seconds to several seconds.",

                "Many routing protocols have been proposed in the literature to address the problem, but few were evaluated in a realistic opportunistic network setting.",
                "We use simulation and contact traces (derived from logs in a production network) to evaluate and compare five existing protocols: direct-delivery, epidemic, random, PRoPHET, and Link-State, as well as our own proposed routing protocol.",
                "We show that the direct delivery and epidemic routing protocols suffer either low delivery ratio or high resource usage, and other protocols make tradeoffs between delivery ratio and resource usage.",

                "Long link delays happen in networks with communication between nodes at a great distance, such as interplanetary networks [2].",
                "Link breaks are caused by nodes moving out of range, environmental changes, interference from other moving objects, radio power-offs, or failed nodes.",
                "For us, mobile opportunistic networks are those DTNs with sparse node population and frequent link breaks caused by power-offs and the mobility of the nodes.",

                "Some devices can form a small mobile ad-hoc network when the nodes move close to each other.",
                "But a node may frequently be isolated from other nodes.",
                "Note that traditional Internet routing protocols and ad-hoc routing protocols, such as AODV [20] or DSDV [19], assume that a contemporaneous endto-end path exists, and thus fail in mobile opportunistic networks.",

                "ROUTING PROTOCOL A routing protocol is designed for forwarding messages from one node (source) to another node (destination).",
                "Any node may generate messages for any other node, and may carry messages destined for other nodes.",
                "In this paper, we consider only messages that are unicast (single destination).",
                "DTN routing protocols could be described in part by their transfer probability and replication probability; that is, when one node meets another node, what is the probability that a message should be transfered and if so, whether the sender should retain its copy.",
                "Two extremes are the direct-delivery protocol and the epidemic protocol.",
                "The former transfers with probability 1 when the node meets the destination, 0 for others, and no replication.",
                "The latter uses transfer probability 1 for all nodes and unlimited replication.",
                "Both these protocols have their advantages and disadvantages.",
                "All other protocols are between the two extremes.",
                "First, we define the notion of contact between two nodes.",
                "Then we describe five existing protocols before presenting our own proposal.",
                "A contact is defined as a period of time during which two nodes have the opportunity to communicate.",
                "Although we are aware that wireless technologies differ, we assume that a node can reliably detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes.",
                "A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time.",
                "The contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other nodes.",
                "Node i has a contact history Hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j.",
                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network.",
                "The source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets.",
                "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",
                "Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.",
                "This protocol is simple, but may use significant resources; excessive communication may drain each nodes battery quickly.",
                "Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.",
                "At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.",
                "After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.",
                "An optimization to reduce the communication cost is to transfer index messages before transferring any data message.",
                "The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds.",
                "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
                "We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",
                "The message has some chance of being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires. 2.4 PRoPHET Protocol PRoPHET [16] is a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of past Encounters and Transitivity to estimate each nodes delivery probability for each other node.",
                "When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.",
                "Lindgren et al. [16] chose 0.75, as did we in our evaluation.",
                "When node i does not meet j for some time, the delivery probability decreases by pij = αk pij, (2) where α is the aging factor (α < 1), and k is the number of time units since the last update.",
                "The PRoPHET protocol exchanges index messages as well as delivery probabilities.",
                "When node i receives node js delivery probabilities, node i may compute the transitive delivery probability through j to z with piz = piz + (1 − piz)pijpjzβ, (3) where β is a design parameter for the impact of transitivity; we used β = 0.25 as did Lindgren [16]. 2.5 Link-State Protocol Su et al. [22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination.",
                "They use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged intercontact duration as the weight on links.",
                "The exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)I, (4) where I is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor.",
                "Nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight. 36 3.",
                "TIMELY-CONTACT PROBABILITY We also use historical contact information to estimate the probability of meeting other nodes in the future.",
                "But our method differs in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time.",
                "For example, what is the contact probability in the next hour?",
                "Neither PRoPHET nor Link-State considers time in this way.",
                "One way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the ratio of the total contact duration to the total time.",
                "However, this approach does not capture the frequency of contacts.",
                "For example, one node may have a long contact with another node, followed by a long non-contact period.",
                "A third node may have a short contact with the first node, followed by a short non-contact period.",
                "Using the above estimation approach, both examples would have similar contact probability.",
                "In the second example, however, the two nodes have more frequent contacts.",
                "We design a method to capture the contact frequency of mobile nodes.",
                "For this purpose, we assume that even short contacts are sufficient to exchange messages.1 The probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the following procedure.",
                "We divide the contact history Hi(j) into a sequence of n periods of ΔT starting from the start time (t0) of the first contact in history Hi(j) to the current time.",
                "We number each of the n periods from 0 to n − 1, then check each period.",
                "If node i had any contact with node j during a given period m, which is [t0 + mΔT, t0 + (m + 1)ΔT), we set the contact status Im to be 1; otherwise, the contact status Im is 0.",
                "The probability p (0) ij that node i meets node j in the next ΔT can be estimated as the average of the contact status in prior intervals: p (0) ij = 1 n n−1X m=0 Im. (5) To adapt to the change of contact patterns, and reduce the storage space for contact histories, a node may discard old history contacts; in this situation, the estimate would be based on only the retained history.",
                "The above probability is the direct contact probability of two nodes.",
                "We are also interested in the probability that we may be able to pass a message through a sequence of k nodes.",
                "We define the k-order probability inductively, p (k) ij = p (0) ij + X α p (0) iα p (k−1) αj , (6) where α is any node other than i or j. 3.1 Our Routing Protocol We first consider the case of a two-hop path, that is, with only one relay node.",
                "We consider two approaches: either the receiving neighbor decides whether to act as a relay, or the source decides which neighbors to use as relay. 3.1.1 Receiver Decision Whenever a node meets other nodes, they exchange all their messages (or as above, index messages).",
                "If the destination of a message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, if the probability of delivering the message to its destination through this receiver node within ΔT is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, the message is stored in the receivers storage to forward 1 In our simulation, however, we accurately model the communication costs and some short contacts will not succeed in transfer of all messages. to the destination.",
                "If the probability is less than the threshold, the receiver discards the message.",
                "Notice that our protocol replicates the message whenever a good-looking relay comes along. 3.1.2 Sender Decision To make decisions, a sender must have the information about its neighbors contact probability with a messages destination.",
                "Therefore, meta-data exchange is necessary.",
                "When two nodes meet, they exchange a meta-message, containing an unordered list of node IDs for which the sender of the metamessage has a contact probability greater than the threshold.",
                "After receiving a meta-message, a node checks whether it has any message that destined to its neighbor, or to a node in the node list of the neighbors meta-message.",
                "If it has, it sends a copy of the message.",
                "When a node receives a message, if the destination of the message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, the message is stored in the receivers storage for forwarding to the destination. 3.1.3 Multi-node Relay When we use more than two hops to relay a message, each node needs to know the contact probabilities along all possible paths to the message destination.",
                "Every node keeps a contact probability matrix, in which each cell pij is a contact probability between to nodes i and j.",
                "Each node i computes its own contact probabilities (row i) with other nodes using Equation (5) whenever the node ends a contact with other nodes.",
                "Each row of the contact probability matrix has a version number; the version number for row i is only increased when node i updates the matrix entries in row i.",
                "Other matrix entries are updated through exchange with other nodes when they meet.",
                "When two nodes i and j meet, they first exchange their contact probability matrices.",
                "Node i compares its own contact matrix with node js matrix.",
                "If node js matrix has a row l with a higher version number, then node i replaces its own row l with node js row l. Likewise node j updates its matrix.",
                "After the exchange, the two nodes will have identical contact probability matrices.",
                "Next, if a node has a message to forward, the node estimates its neighboring nodes order-k contact probability to contact the destination of the message using Equation (6).",
                "If p (k) ij is above a threshold, or if j is the destination of the message, node i will send a copy of the message to node j.",
                "All the above effort serves to determine the transfer probability when two nodes meet.",
                "The replication decision is orthogonal to the transfer decision.",
                "In our implementation, we always replicate.",
                "Although PRoPHET [16] and Link-State [22] do no replication, as described, we added replication to those protocols for better comparison to our protocol. 4.",
                "EVALUATION RESULTS We evaluate and compare the results of direct delivery, epidemic, random, PRoPHET, Link-State, and timely-contact routing protocols. 4.1 Mobility traces We use real mobility data collected at Dartmouth College.",
                "Dartmouth College has collected association and disassociation messages from devices on its wireless network wireless users since spring 2001 [13].",
                "Each message records the wireless card MAC address, the time of association/disassociation, and the name of the access point.",
                "We treat each unique MAC address as a node.",
                "For 37 more information about Dartmouths network and the data collection, see previous studies [7, 12].",
                "Our data are not contacts in a mobile ad-hoc network.",
                "We can approximate contact traces by assuming that two users can communicate with each other whenever they are associated with the same access point.",
                "Chaintreau et al. [5] used Dartmouth data traces and made the same assumption to theoretically analyze the impact of human mobility on opportunistic forwarding algorithms.",
                "This assumption may not be accurate,2 but it is a good first approximation.",
                "In our simulation, we imagine the same clients and same mobility in a network with no access points.",
                "Since our campus has full WiFi coverage, we assume that the location of access points had little impact on users mobility.",
                "We simulated one full month of trace data (November 2003) taken from CRAWDAD [13], with 5, 142 users.",
                "Although predictionbased protocols require prior contact history to estimate each nodes delivery probability, our preliminary results show that the performance improvement of warming-up over one month of trace was marginal.",
                "Therefore, for simplicity, we show the results of all protocols without warming-up. 4.2 Simulator We developed a custom simulator.3 Since we used contact traces derived from real mobility data, we did not need a mobility model and omitted physical and link-layer details for node discovery.",
                "We were aware that the time for neighbor discovery in different wireless technologies vary from less than one seconds to several seconds.",
                "Furthermore, connection establishment also takes time, such as DHCP.",
                "In our simulation, we assumed the nodes could discover and connect each other instantly when they were associated with a same AP.",
                "To accurately model communication costs, however, we simulated some MAC-layer behaviors, such as collision.",
                "The default settings of the network of our simulator are listed in Table 1, using the values recommended by other papers [22, 16].",
                "The message probability was the probability of generating messages, as described in Section 4.3.",
                "The default transmission bandwidth was 11 Mb/s.",
                "When one node tried to transmit a message, it first checked whether any nearby node was transmitting.",
                "If it was, the node backed off a random number of slots.",
                "Each slot was 1 millisecond, and the maximum number of backoff slots was 30.",
                "The size of messages was uniformly distributed between 80 bytes and 1024 bytes.",
                "The hop count limit (HCL) was the maximum number of hops before a message should stop forwarding.",

                "The replication factor r was not limited by default, so the source of a message transferred the messages to any other node that had a contact probability with the message destination higher than the probability threshold. 4.3 Message generation After each contact event in the <br>contact trace</br>, we generated a message with a given probability; we choose a source node and a des2 Two nodes may not have been able to directly communicate while they were at two far sides of an access point, or two nodes may have been able to directly communicate if they were between two adjacent access points. 3 We tried to use a general network simulator (ns2), which was extremely slow when simulating a large number of mobile nodes (in our case, more than 5000 nodes), and provided unnecessary detail in modeling lower-level network protocols.",

                "Although we are aware that wireless technologies differ, we assume that a node can reliably detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes.",
                "A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time.",
                "The contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other nodes.",
                "Node i has a contact history Hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j.",
                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network.",
                "The source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets.",
                "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",
                "Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.",
                "This protocol is simple, but may use significant resources; excessive communication may drain each nodes battery quickly.",
                "Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.",
                "At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.",
                "After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.",
                "An optimization to reduce the communication cost is to transfer index messages before transferring any data message.",
                "The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds.",
                "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
                "We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",
                "The message has some chance of being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires. 2.4 PRoPHET Protocol PRoPHET [16] is a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of past Encounters and Transitivity to estimate each nodes delivery probability for each other node.",
                "When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.",
                "Lindgren et al. [16] chose 0.75, as did we in our evaluation.",
                "When node i does not meet j for some time, the delivery probability decreases by pij = αk pij, (2) where α is the aging factor (α < 1), and k is the number of time units since the last update.",
                "The PRoPHET protocol exchanges index messages as well as delivery probabilities.",
                "When node i receives node js delivery probabilities, node i may compute the transitive delivery probability through j to z with piz = piz + (1 − piz)pijpjzβ, (3) where β is a design parameter for the impact of transitivity; we used β = 0.25 as did Lindgren [16]. 2.5 Link-State Protocol Su et al. [22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination.",
                "They use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged intercontact duration as the weight on links.",
                "The exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)I, (4) where I is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor.",
                "Nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight. 36 3.",
                "TIMELY-CONTACT PROBABILITY We also use historical contact information to estimate the probability of meeting other nodes in the future.",
                "But our method differs in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time.",
                "For example, what is the contact probability in the next hour?",
                "Neither PRoPHET nor Link-State considers time in this way.",
                "One way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the ratio of the total contact duration to the total time.",
                "However, this approach does not capture the frequency of contacts.",
                "For example, one node may have a long contact with another node, followed by a long non-contact period.",
                "A third node may have a short contact with the first node, followed by a short non-contact period.",

                "Although we are aware that wireless technologies differ, we assume that a node can reliably detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes.",
                "A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time.",
                "The contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other nodes.",
                "Node i has a contact history Hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j.",
                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network.",
                "The source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets.",
                "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",
                "Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.",
                "This protocol is simple, but may use significant resources; excessive communication may drain each nodes battery quickly.",
                "Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.",
                "At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.",
                "After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.",
                "An optimization to reduce the communication cost is to transfer index messages before transferring any data message.",
                "The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds.",
                "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
                "We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",
                "The message has some chance of being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires. 2.4 PRoPHET Protocol PRoPHET [16] is a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of past Encounters and Transitivity to estimate each nodes delivery probability for each other node.",
                "When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.",
                "Lindgren et al. [16] chose 0.75, as did we in our evaluation.",
                "When node i does not meet j for some time, the delivery probability decreases by pij = αk pij, (2) where α is the aging factor (α < 1), and k is the number of time units since the last update.",
                "The PRoPHET protocol exchanges index messages as well as delivery probabilities.",
                "When node i receives node js delivery probabilities, node i may compute the transitive delivery probability through j to z with piz = piz + (1 − piz)pijpjzβ, (3) where β is a design parameter for the impact of transitivity; we used β = 0.25 as did Lindgren [16]. 2.5 Link-State Protocol Su et al. [22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination.",
                "They use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged intercontact duration as the weight on links.",
                "The exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)I, (4) where I is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor.",
                "Nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight. 36 3.",
                "TIMELY-CONTACT PROBABILITY We also use historical contact information to estimate the probability of meeting other nodes in the future.",
                "But our method differs in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time.",
                "For example, what is the contact probability in the next hour?",
                "Neither PRoPHET nor Link-State considers time in this way.",
                "One way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the ratio of the total contact duration to the total time.",
                "However, this approach does not capture the frequency of contacts.",
                "For example, one node may have a long contact with another node, followed by a long non-contact period.",
                "A third node may have a short contact with the first node, followed by a short non-contact period.",
                "Using the above estimation approach, both examples would have similar contact probability.",
                "In the second example, however, the two nodes have more frequent contacts.",
                "We design a method to capture the contact frequency of mobile nodes.",
                "For this purpose, we assume that even short contacts are sufficient to exchange messages.1 The probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the following procedure.",
                "We divide the contact history Hi(j) into a sequence of n periods of ΔT starting from the start time (t0) of the first contact in history Hi(j) to the current time.",
                "We number each of the n periods from 0 to n − 1, then check each period.",
                "If node i had any contact with node j during a given period m, which is [t0 + mΔT, t0 + (m + 1)ΔT), we set the contact status Im to be 1; otherwise, the contact status Im is 0.",
                "The probability p (0) ij that node i meets node j in the next ΔT can be estimated as the average of the contact status in prior intervals: p (0) ij = 1 n n−1X m=0 Im. (5) To adapt to the change of contact patterns, and reduce the storage space for contact histories, a node may discard old history contacts; in this situation, the estimate would be based on only the retained history.",
                "The above probability is the direct contact probability of two nodes.",
                "We are also interested in the probability that we may be able to pass a message through a sequence of k nodes.",
                "We define the k-order probability inductively, p (k) ij = p (0) ij + X α p (0) iα p (k−1) αj , (6) where α is any node other than i or j. 3.1 Our Routing Protocol We first consider the case of a two-hop path, that is, with only one relay node.",
                "We consider two approaches: either the receiving neighbor decides whether to act as a relay, or the source decides which neighbors to use as relay. 3.1.1 Receiver Decision Whenever a node meets other nodes, they exchange all their messages (or as above, index messages).",
                "If the destination of a message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, if the probability of delivering the message to its destination through this receiver node within ΔT is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, the message is stored in the receivers storage to forward 1 In our simulation, however, we accurately model the communication costs and some short contacts will not succeed in transfer of all messages. to the destination.",
                "If the probability is less than the threshold, the receiver discards the message.",
                "Notice that our protocol replicates the message whenever a good-looking relay comes along. 3.1.2 Sender Decision To make decisions, a sender must have the information about its neighbors contact probability with a messages destination.",
                "Therefore, meta-data exchange is necessary.",
                "When two nodes meet, they exchange a meta-message, containing an unordered list of node IDs for which the sender of the metamessage has a contact probability greater than the threshold.",
                "After receiving a meta-message, a node checks whether it has any message that destined to its neighbor, or to a node in the node list of the neighbors meta-message.",
                "If it has, it sends a copy of the message.",
                "When a node receives a message, if the destination of the message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, the message is stored in the receivers storage for forwarding to the destination. 3.1.3 Multi-node Relay When we use more than two hops to relay a message, each node needs to know the contact probabilities along all possible paths to the message destination.",
                "Every node keeps a contact probability matrix, in which each cell pij is a contact probability between to nodes i and j.",
                "Each node i computes its own contact probabilities (row i) with other nodes using Equation (5) whenever the node ends a contact with other nodes.",
                "Each row of the contact probability matrix has a version number; the version number for row i is only increased when node i updates the matrix entries in row i.",

                "Node i compares its own contact matrix with node js matrix.",
                "If node js matrix has a row l with a higher version number, then node i replaces its own row l with node js row l. Likewise node j updates its matrix.",

                "Although we are aware that wireless technologies differ, we assume that a node can reliably detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes.",
                "A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time.",
                "The contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other nodes.",
                "Node i has a contact history Hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j.",
                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network.",
                "The source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets.",
                "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",
                "Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.",
                "This protocol is simple, but may use significant resources; excessive communication may drain each nodes battery quickly.",
                "Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.",
                "At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.",
                "After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.",
                "An optimization to reduce the communication cost is to transfer index messages before transferring any data message.",
                "The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds.",
                "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
                "We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",
                "The message has some chance of being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires. 2.4 PRoPHET Protocol PRoPHET [16] is a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of past Encounters and Transitivity to estimate each nodes delivery probability for each other node.",
                "When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.",
                "Lindgren et al. [16] chose 0.75, as did we in our evaluation.",
                "When node i does not meet j for some time, the delivery probability decreases by pij = αk pij, (2) where α is the aging factor (α < 1), and k is the number of time units since the last update.",
                "The PRoPHET protocol exchanges index messages as well as delivery probabilities.",
                "When node i receives node js delivery probabilities, node i may compute the transitive delivery probability through j to z with piz = piz + (1 − piz)pijpjzβ, (3) where β is a design parameter for the impact of transitivity; we used β = 0.25 as did Lindgren [16]. 2.5 Link-State Protocol Su et al. [22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination.",
                "They use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged intercontact duration as the weight on links.",
                "The exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)I, (4) where I is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor.",
                "Nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight. 36 3.",
                "TIMELY-CONTACT PROBABILITY We also use historical contact information to estimate the probability of meeting other nodes in the future.",
                "But our method differs in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time.",
                "For example, what is the contact probability in the next hour?",
                "Neither PRoPHET nor Link-State considers time in this way.",
                "One way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the ratio of the total contact duration to the total time.",
                "However, this approach does not capture the frequency of contacts.",
                "For example, one node may have a long contact with another node, followed by a long non-contact period.",
                "A third node may have a short contact with the first node, followed by a short non-contact period.",
                "Using the above estimation approach, both examples would have similar contact probability.",
                "In the second example, however, the two nodes have more frequent contacts.",
                "We design a method to capture the contact frequency of mobile nodes.",
                "For this purpose, we assume that even short contacts are sufficient to exchange messages.1 The probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the following procedure.",
                "We divide the contact history Hi(j) into a sequence of n periods of ΔT starting from the start time (t0) of the first contact in history Hi(j) to the current time.",
                "We number each of the n periods from 0 to n − 1, then check each period.",
                "If node i had any contact with node j during a given period m, which is [t0 + mΔT, t0 + (m + 1)ΔT), we set the contact status Im to be 1; otherwise, the contact status Im is 0.",
                "The probability p (0) ij that node i meets node j in the next ΔT can be estimated as the average of the contact status in prior intervals: p (0) ij = 1 n n−1X m=0 Im. (5) To adapt to the change of contact patterns, and reduce the storage space for contact histories, a node may discard old history contacts; in this situation, the estimate would be based on only the retained history.",
                "The above probability is the direct contact probability of two nodes.",
                "We are also interested in the probability that we may be able to pass a message through a sequence of k nodes.",
                "We define the k-order probability inductively, p (k) ij = p (0) ij + X α p (0) iα p (k−1) αj , (6) where α is any node other than i or j. 3.1 Our Routing Protocol We first consider the case of a two-hop path, that is, with only one relay node.",
                "We consider two approaches: either the receiving neighbor decides whether to act as a relay, or the source decides which neighbors to use as relay. 3.1.1 Receiver Decision Whenever a node meets other nodes, they exchange all their messages (or as above, index messages).",
                "If the destination of a message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, if the probability of delivering the message to its destination through this receiver node within ΔT is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, the message is stored in the receivers storage to forward 1 In our simulation, however, we accurately model the communication costs and some short contacts will not succeed in transfer of all messages. to the destination.",
                "If the probability is less than the threshold, the receiver discards the message.",
                "Notice that our protocol replicates the message whenever a good-looking relay comes along. 3.1.2 Sender Decision To make decisions, a sender must have the information about its neighbors contact probability with a messages destination.",
                "Therefore, meta-data exchange is necessary.",
                "When two nodes meet, they exchange a meta-message, containing an unordered list of node IDs for which the sender of the metamessage has a contact probability greater than the threshold.",
                "After receiving a meta-message, a node checks whether it has any message that destined to its neighbor, or to a node in the node list of the neighbors meta-message.",
                "If it has, it sends a copy of the message.",
                "When a node receives a message, if the destination of the message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, the message is stored in the receivers storage for forwarding to the destination. 3.1.3 Multi-node Relay When we use more than two hops to relay a message, each node needs to know the contact probabilities along all possible paths to the message destination.",
                "Every node keeps a contact probability matrix, in which each cell pij is a contact probability between to nodes i and j.",
                "Each node i computes its own contact probabilities (row i) with other nodes using Equation (5) whenever the node ends a contact with other nodes.",
                "Each row of the contact probability matrix has a version number; the version number for row i is only increased when node i updates the matrix entries in row i.",
                "Other matrix entries are updated through exchange with other nodes when they meet.",
                "When two nodes i and j meet, they first exchange their contact probability matrices.",
                "Node i compares its own contact matrix with node js matrix.",
                "If node js matrix has a row l with a higher version number, then node i replaces its own row l with node js row l. Likewise node j updates its matrix.",
                "After the exchange, the two nodes will have identical contact probability matrices.",
                "Next, if a node has a message to forward, the node estimates its neighboring nodes order-k contact probability to contact the destination of the message using Equation (6).",
                "If p (k) ij is above a threshold, or if j is the destination of the message, node i will send a copy of the message to node j.",
                "All the above effort serves to determine the transfer probability when two nodes meet.",
                "The replication decision is orthogonal to the transfer decision.",
                "In our implementation, we always replicate.",
                "Although PRoPHET [16] and Link-State [22] do no replication, as described, we added replication to those protocols for better comparison to our protocol. 4.",
                "EVALUATION RESULTS We evaluate and compare the results of direct delivery, epidemic, random, PRoPHET, Link-State, and timely-contact routing protocols. 4.1 Mobility traces We use real mobility data collected at Dartmouth College.",
                "Dartmouth College has collected association and disassociation messages from devices on its wireless network wireless users since spring 2001 [13].",

                "This assumption may not be accurate,2 but it is a good first approximation.",
                "In our simulation, we imagine the same clients and same mobility in a network with no access points.",
                "Since our campus has full WiFi coverage, we assume that the location of access points had little impact on users mobility.",
                "We simulated one full month of trace data (November 2003) taken from CRAWDAD [13], with 5, 142 users.",
                "Although predictionbased protocols require prior contact history to estimate each nodes delivery probability, our preliminary results show that the performance improvement of warming-up over one month of trace was marginal.",
                "Therefore, for simplicity, we show the results of all protocols without warming-up. 4.2 Simulator We developed a custom simulator.3 Since we used contact traces derived from real mobility data, we did not need a mobility model and omitted physical and link-layer details for node discovery.",
                "We were aware that the time for neighbor discovery in different wireless technologies vary from less than one seconds to several seconds.",
                "Furthermore, connection establishment also takes time, such as DHCP.",

                "Long link delays happen in networks with communication between nodes at a great distance, such as interplanetary networks [2].",
                "Link breaks are caused by nodes moving out of range, environmental changes, interference from other moving objects, radio power-offs, or failed nodes.",
                "For us, mobile opportunistic networks are those DTNs with sparse node population and frequent link breaks caused by power-offs and the mobility of the nodes.",
                "Mobile opportunistic networks have received increasing interest from researchers.",
                "In the literature, these networks include mobile sensor networks [25], wild-animal tracking networks [11], pocketswitched networks [8], and transportation networks [1, 14].",
                "We expect to see more opportunistic networks when the one-laptopper-child (OLPC) project [18] starts rolling out inexpensive laptops with wireless networking capability for children in developing countries, where often no infrastructure exits.",
                "Opportunistic networking is one promising approach for those children to exchange information.",
                "One fundamental problem in opportunistic networks is how to route messages from their source to their destination.",
                "Mobile opportunistic networks differ from the Internet in that disconnections are the norm instead of the exception.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, communication devices can be carried by people [4], vehicles [1] or animals [11].",
                "Some devices can form a small mobile ad-hoc network when the nodes move close to each other.",
                "But a node may frequently be isolated from other nodes.",
                "Note that traditional Internet routing protocols and ad-hoc routing protocols, such as AODV [20] or DSDV [19], assume that a contemporaneous endto-end path exists, and thus fail in mobile opportunistic networks.",
                "Indeed, there may never exist an end-to-end path between two given devices.",
                "In this paper, we study protocols for routing messages between wireless networking devices carried by people.",
                "We assume that people send messages to other people occasionally, using their devices; when no direct link exists between the source and the destination of the message, other nodes may relay the message to the destination.",
                "Each device represents a unique person (it is out of the scope of this paper when a device maybe carried by multiple people).",
                "Each message is destined for a specific person and thus for a specific node carried by that person.",
                "Although one person may carry multiple devices, we assume that the sender knows which device is the best to receive the message.",
                "We do not consider multicast or geocast in this paper.",
                "Many routing protocols have been proposed in the literature.",
                "Few of them were evaluated in realistic network settings, or even in realistic simulations, due to the lack of any realistic people mobility model.",
                "Random walk or random way-point mobility models are often used to evaluate the performance of those routing protocols.",
                "Although these synthetic mobility models have received extensive interest by mobile ad-hoc network researchers [3], they do not reflect peoples mobility patterns [9].",
                "Realising the limitations of using random mobility models in simulations, a few researchers have studied routing protocols in mobile opportunistic networks with <br>realistic mobility trace</br>s.",
                "Chaintreau et al. [5] theoretically analyzed the impact of routing algorithms over a model derived from a realistic mobility data set.",
                "Su et al. [22] simulated a set of routing 35 protocols in a small experimental network.",
                "Those studies help researchers better understand the theoretical limits of opportunistic networks, and the routing protocol performance in a small network (20-30 nodes).",
                "Deploying and experimenting large-scale mobile opportunistic networks is difficult, we too resort to simulation.",
                "Instead of using a complex mobility model to mimic peoples mobility patterns, we used mobility traces collected in a production wireless network at Dartmouth College to drive our simulation.",
                "Our messagegeneration model, however, was synthetic.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simulate the effect of routing protocols in a large-scale mobile opportunistic network, using realistic contact traces derived from real traces of a production network with more than 5, 000 users.",
                "Using realistic contact traces, we evaluate the performance of three naive routing protocols (direct-delivery, epidemic, and random) and two prediction-based routing protocols, PRoPHET [16] and Link-State [22].",
                "We also propose a new prediction-based routing protocol, and compare it to the above in our evaluation. 2.",
                "ROUTING PROTOCOL A routing protocol is designed for forwarding messages from one node (source) to another node (destination).",
                "Any node may generate messages for any other node, and may carry messages destined for other nodes.",
                "In this paper, we consider only messages that are unicast (single destination).",
                "DTN routing protocols could be described in part by their transfer probability and replication probability; that is, when one node meets another node, what is the probability that a message should be transfered and if so, whether the sender should retain its copy.",
                "Two extremes are the direct-delivery protocol and the epidemic protocol.",
                "The former transfers with probability 1 when the node meets the destination, 0 for others, and no replication.",
                "The latter uses transfer probability 1 for all nodes and unlimited replication.",
                "Both these protocols have their advantages and disadvantages.",
                "All other protocols are between the two extremes.",
                "First, we define the notion of contact between two nodes.",
                "Then we describe five existing protocols before presenting our own proposal.",
                "A contact is defined as a period of time during which two nodes have the opportunity to communicate.",
                "Although we are aware that wireless technologies differ, we assume that a node can reliably detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes.",
                "A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time.",
                "The contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other nodes.",
                "Node i has a contact history Hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j.",
                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network.",
                "The source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets.",
                "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",
                "Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.",
                "This protocol is simple, but may use significant resources; excessive communication may drain each nodes battery quickly.",
                "Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.",
                "At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.",
                "After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.",
                "An optimization to reduce the communication cost is to transfer index messages before transferring any data message.",
                "The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds.",
                "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
                "We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",
                "The message has some chance of being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires. 2.4 PRoPHET Protocol PRoPHET [16] is a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of past Encounters and Transitivity to estimate each nodes delivery probability for each other node.",
                "When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.",
                "Lindgren et al. [16] chose 0.75, as did we in our evaluation.",
                "When node i does not meet j for some time, the delivery probability decreases by pij = αk pij, (2) where α is the aging factor (α < 1), and k is the number of time units since the last update.",
                "The PRoPHET protocol exchanges index messages as well as delivery probabilities.",
                "When node i receives node js delivery probabilities, node i may compute the transitive delivery probability through j to z with piz = piz + (1 − piz)pijpjzβ, (3) where β is a design parameter for the impact of transitivity; we used β = 0.25 as did Lindgren [16]. 2.5 Link-State Protocol Su et al. [22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination.",
                "They use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged intercontact duration as the weight on links.",
                "The exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)I, (4) where I is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor.",
                "Nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight. 36 3.",
                "TIMELY-CONTACT PROBABILITY We also use historical contact information to estimate the probability of meeting other nodes in the future.",
                "But our method differs in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time.",
                "For example, what is the contact probability in the next hour?",
                "Neither PRoPHET nor Link-State considers time in this way.",
                "One way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the ratio of the total contact duration to the total time.",
                "However, this approach does not capture the frequency of contacts.",
                "For example, one node may have a long contact with another node, followed by a long non-contact period.",
                "A third node may have a short contact with the first node, followed by a short non-contact period.",
                "Using the above estimation approach, both examples would have similar contact probability.",
                "In the second example, however, the two nodes have more frequent contacts.",
                "We design a method to capture the contact frequency of mobile nodes.",
                "For this purpose, we assume that even short contacts are sufficient to exchange messages.1 The probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the following procedure.",
                "We divide the contact history Hi(j) into a sequence of n periods of ΔT starting from the start time (t0) of the first contact in history Hi(j) to the current time.",
                "We number each of the n periods from 0 to n − 1, then check each period.",
                "If node i had any contact with node j during a given period m, which is [t0 + mΔT, t0 + (m + 1)ΔT), we set the contact status Im to be 1; otherwise, the contact status Im is 0.",
                "The probability p (0) ij that node i meets node j in the next ΔT can be estimated as the average of the contact status in prior intervals: p (0) ij = 1 n n−1X m=0 Im. (5) To adapt to the change of contact patterns, and reduce the storage space for contact histories, a node may discard old history contacts; in this situation, the estimate would be based on only the retained history.",
                "The above probability is the direct contact probability of two nodes.",
                "We are also interested in the probability that we may be able to pass a message through a sequence of k nodes.",
                "We define the k-order probability inductively, p (k) ij = p (0) ij + X α p (0) iα p (k−1) αj , (6) where α is any node other than i or j. 3.1 Our Routing Protocol We first consider the case of a two-hop path, that is, with only one relay node.",
                "We consider two approaches: either the receiving neighbor decides whether to act as a relay, or the source decides which neighbors to use as relay. 3.1.1 Receiver Decision Whenever a node meets other nodes, they exchange all their messages (or as above, index messages).",
                "If the destination of a message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, if the probability of delivering the message to its destination through this receiver node within ΔT is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, the message is stored in the receivers storage to forward 1 In our simulation, however, we accurately model the communication costs and some short contacts will not succeed in transfer of all messages. to the destination.",
                "If the probability is less than the threshold, the receiver discards the message.",
                "Notice that our protocol replicates the message whenever a good-looking relay comes along. 3.1.2 Sender Decision To make decisions, a sender must have the information about its neighbors contact probability with a messages destination.",
                "Therefore, meta-data exchange is necessary.",
                "When two nodes meet, they exchange a meta-message, containing an unordered list of node IDs for which the sender of the metamessage has a contact probability greater than the threshold.",
                "After receiving a meta-message, a node checks whether it has any message that destined to its neighbor, or to a node in the node list of the neighbors meta-message.",
                "If it has, it sends a copy of the message.",
                "When a node receives a message, if the destination of the message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, the message is stored in the receivers storage for forwarding to the destination. 3.1.3 Multi-node Relay When we use more than two hops to relay a message, each node needs to know the contact probabilities along all possible paths to the message destination.",
                "Every node keeps a contact probability matrix, in which each cell pij is a contact probability between to nodes i and j.",
                "Each node i computes its own contact probabilities (row i) with other nodes using Equation (5) whenever the node ends a contact with other nodes.",
                "Each row of the contact probability matrix has a version number; the version number for row i is only increased when node i updates the matrix entries in row i.",
                "Other matrix entries are updated through exchange with other nodes when they meet.",
                "When two nodes i and j meet, they first exchange their contact probability matrices.",
                "Node i compares its own contact matrix with node js matrix.",
                "If node js matrix has a row l with a higher version number, then node i replaces its own row l with node js row l. Likewise node j updates its matrix.",
                "After the exchange, the two nodes will have identical contact probability matrices.",
                "Next, if a node has a message to forward, the node estimates its neighboring nodes order-k contact probability to contact the destination of the message using Equation (6).",
                "If p (k) ij is above a threshold, or if j is the destination of the message, node i will send a copy of the message to node j.",
                "All the above effort serves to determine the transfer probability when two nodes meet.",
                "The replication decision is orthogonal to the transfer decision.",
                "In our implementation, we always replicate.",
                "Although PRoPHET [16] and Link-State [22] do no replication, as described, we added replication to those protocols for better comparison to our protocol. 4.",
                "EVALUATION RESULTS We evaluate and compare the results of direct delivery, epidemic, random, PRoPHET, Link-State, and timely-contact routing protocols. 4.1 Mobility traces We use real mobility data collected at Dartmouth College.",
                "Dartmouth College has collected association and disassociation messages from devices on its wireless network wireless users since spring 2001 [13].",
                "Each message records the wireless card MAC address, the time of association/disassociation, and the name of the access point.",
                "We treat each unique MAC address as a node.",
                "For 37 more information about Dartmouths network and the data collection, see previous studies [7, 12].",

                "We can approximate contact traces by assuming that two users can communicate with each other whenever they are associated with the same access point.",
                "Chaintreau et al. [5] used Dartmouth data traces and made the same assumption to theoretically analyze the impact of human mobility on opportunistic forwarding algorithms.",
                "This assumption may not be accurate,2 but it is a good first approximation.",
                "In our simulation, we imagine the same clients and same mobility in a network with no access points.",
                "Since our campus has full WiFi coverage, we assume that the location of access points had little impact on users mobility.",
                "We simulated one full month of trace data (November 2003) taken from CRAWDAD [13], with 5, 142 users.",
                "Although predictionbased protocols require prior contact history to estimate each nodes delivery probability, our preliminary results show that the performance improvement of warming-up over one month of trace was marginal.",
                "Therefore, for simplicity, we show the results of all protocols without warming-up. 4.2 Simulator We developed a custom simulator.3 Since we used contact traces derived from real mobility data, we did not need a mobility model and omitted physical and link-layer details for node discovery.",
                "We were aware that the time for neighbor discovery in different wireless technologies vary from less than one seconds to several seconds.",
                "Furthermore, connection establishment also takes time, such as DHCP.",

                "The replication factor r was not limited by default, so the source of a message transferred the messages to any other node that had a contact probability with the message destination higher than the probability threshold. 4.3 Message generation After each contact event in the contact trace, we generated a message with a given probability; we choose a source node and a des2 Two nodes may not have been able to directly communicate while they were at two far sides of an access point, or two nodes may have been able to directly communicate if they were between two adjacent access points. 3 We tried to use a general network simulator (ns2), which was extremely slow when simulating a large number of mobile nodes (in our case, more than 5000 nodes), and provided unnecessary detail in modeling lower-level network protocols.",

                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network.",

                "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",

                "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
                "We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",

                "When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.",

[22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination.",
                "They use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged intercontact duration as the weight on links.",
                "The exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)I, (4) where I is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor.",

                "TIMELY-CONTACT PROBABILITY We also use historical contact information to estimate the probability of meeting other nodes in the future.",
                "But our method differs in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time.",
                "For example, what is the contact probability in the next hour?",
                "Neither PRoPHET nor Link-State considers time in this way.",
                "One way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the ratio of the total contact duration to the total time.",

                "A third node may have a short contact with the first node, followed by a short non-contact period.",
                "Using the above estimation approach, both examples would have similar contact probability.",
                "In the second example, however, the two nodes have more frequent contacts.",
                "We design a method to capture the contact frequency of mobile nodes.",
                "For this purpose, we assume that even short contacts are sufficient to exchange messages.1 The probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the following procedure.",
                "We divide the contact history Hi(j) into a sequence of n periods of ΔT starting from the start time (t0) of the first contact in history Hi(j) to the current time.",
                "We number each of the n periods from 0 to n − 1, then check each period.",
                "If node i had any contact with node j during a given period m, which is [t0 + mΔT, t0 + (m + 1)ΔT), we set the contact status Im to be 1; otherwise, the contact status Im is 0.",
                "The probability p (0) ij that node i meets node j in the next ΔT can be estimated as the average of the contact status in prior intervals: p (0) ij = 1 n n−1X m=0 Im. (5) To adapt to the change of contact patterns, and reduce the storage space for contact histories, a node may discard old history contacts; in this situation, the estimate would be based on only the retained history.",

                "We consider two approaches: either the receiving neighbor decides whether to act as a relay, or the source decides which neighbors to use as relay. 3.1.1 Receiver Decision Whenever a node meets other nodes, they exchange all their messages (or as above, index messages).",
                "If the destination of a message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, if the probability of delivering the message to its destination through this receiver node within ΔT is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, the message is stored in the receivers storage to forward 1 In our simulation, however, we accurately model the communication costs and some short contacts will not succeed in transfer of all messages. to the destination.",
                "If the probability is less than the threshold, the receiver discards the message.",
                "Notice that our protocol replicates the message whenever a good-looking relay comes along. 3.1.2 Sender Decision To make decisions, a sender must have the information about its neighbors contact probability with a messages destination.",

                "When a node receives a message, if the destination of the message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, the message is stored in the receivers storage for forwarding to the destination. 3.1.3 Multi-node Relay When we use more than two hops to relay a message, each node needs to know the contact probabilities along all possible paths to the message destination.",

                "Although we are aware that wireless technologies differ, we assume that a node can reliably detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes.",
                "A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time.",
                "The contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other nodes.",
                "Node i has a contact history Hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j.",
                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network.",
                "The source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets.",
                "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",
                "Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.",
                "This protocol is simple, but may use significant resources; excessive communication may drain each nodes battery quickly.",
                "Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.",
                "At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.",
                "After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.",

                "The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds.",
                "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a <br>transfer probability</br> between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
                "We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",

                "Although we are aware that wireless technologies differ, we assume that a node can reliably detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes.",
                "A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time.",
                "The contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other nodes.",
                "Node i has a contact history Hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j.",
                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network.",
                "The source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets.",
                "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",
                "Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.",
                "This protocol is simple, but may use significant resources; excessive communication may drain each nodes battery quickly.",
                "Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.",
                "At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.",
                "After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.",
                "An optimization to reduce the communication cost is to transfer index messages before transferring any data message.",
                "The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds.",
                "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
                "We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",
                "The message has some chance of being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires. 2.4 PRoPHET Protocol PRoPHET [16] is a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of past Encounters and Transitivity to estimate each nodes delivery probability for each other node.",
                "When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.",
                "Lindgren et al. [16] chose 0.75, as did we in our evaluation.",
                "When node i does not meet j for some time, the delivery probability decreases by pij = αk pij, (2) where α is the aging factor (α < 1), and k is the number of time units since the last update.",
                "The PRoPHET protocol exchanges index messages as well as delivery probabilities.",
                "When node i receives node js delivery probabilities, node i may compute the transitive delivery probability through j to z with piz = piz + (1 − piz)pijpjzβ, (3) where β is a design parameter for the impact of transitivity; we used β = 0.25 as did Lindgren [16]. 2.5 Link-State Protocol Su et al. [22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination.",
                "They use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged intercontact duration as the weight on links.",
                "The exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)I, (4) where I is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor.",
                "Nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight. 36 3.",
                "TIMELY-CONTACT PROBABILITY We also use historical contact information to estimate the probability of meeting other nodes in the future.",
                "But our method differs in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time.",
                "For example, what is the contact probability in the next hour?",
                "Neither PRoPHET nor Link-State considers time in this way.",
                "One way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the ratio of the total contact duration to the total time.",
                "However, this approach does not capture the frequency of contacts.",
                "For example, one node may have a long contact with another node, followed by a long non-contact period.",
                "A third node may have a short contact with the first node, followed by a short non-contact period.",
                "Using the above estimation approach, both examples would have similar contact probability.",
                "In the second example, however, the two nodes have more frequent contacts.",
                "We design a method to capture the contact frequency of mobile nodes.",
                "For this purpose, we assume that even short contacts are sufficient to exchange messages.1 The probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the following procedure.",
                "We divide the contact history Hi(j) into a sequence of n periods of ΔT starting from the start time (t0) of the first contact in history Hi(j) to the current time.",
                "We number each of the n periods from 0 to n − 1, then check each period.",

                "Although we are aware that wireless technologies differ, we assume that a node can reliably detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes.",
                "A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time.",
                "The contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other nodes.",
                "Node i has a contact history Hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j.",
                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network.",
                "The source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets.",
                "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",
                "Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.",
                "This protocol is simple, but may use significant resources; excessive communication may drain each nodes battery quickly.",
                "Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.",
                "At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.",
                "After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.",
                "An optimization to reduce the communication cost is to transfer index messages before transferring any data message.",
                "The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds.",
                "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
                "We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",
                "The message has some chance of being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires. 2.4 PRoPHET Protocol PRoPHET [16] is a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of past Encounters and Transitivity to estimate each nodes delivery probability for each other node.",
                "When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.",
                "Lindgren et al. [16] chose 0.75, as did we in our evaluation.",
                "When node i does not meet j for some time, the delivery probability decreases by pij = αk pij, (2) where α is the aging factor (α < 1), and k is the number of time units since the last update.",

                "When node i receives node js delivery probabilities, node i may compute the transitive delivery probability through j to z with piz = piz + (1 − piz)pijpjzβ, (3) where β is a design parameter for the impact of transitivity; we used β = 0.25 as did Lindgren [16]. 2.5 Link-State Protocol Su et al. [22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination.",
                "They use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged intercontact duration as the weight on links.",
                "The exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)I, (4) where I is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor.",
                "Nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight. 36 3.",
                "TIMELY-CONTACT PROBABILITY We also use historical contact information to estimate the probability of meeting other nodes in the future.",
                "But our method differs in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time.",
                "For example, what is the contact probability in the next hour?",
                "Neither PRoPHET nor Link-State considers time in this way.",
                "One way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the ratio of the total contact duration to the total time.",
                "However, this approach does not capture the frequency of contacts.",
                "For example, one node may have a long contact with another node, followed by a long non-contact period.",
                "A third node may have a short contact with the first node, followed by a short non-contact period.",
                "Using the above estimation approach, both examples would have similar contact probability.",
                "In the second example, however, the two nodes have more frequent contacts.",
                "We design a method to capture the contact frequency of mobile nodes.",
                "For this purpose, we assume that even short contacts are sufficient to exchange messages.1 The probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the following procedure.",
                "We divide the contact history Hi(j) into a sequence of n periods of ΔT starting from the start time (t0) of the first contact in history Hi(j) to the current time.",
                "We number each of the n periods from 0 to n − 1, then check each period.",
                "If node i had any contact with node j during a given period m, which is [t0 + mΔT, t0 + (m + 1)ΔT), we set the contact status Im to be 1; otherwise, the contact status Im is 0.",
                "The probability p (0) ij that node i meets node j in the next ΔT can be estimated as the average of the contact status in prior intervals: p (0) ij = 1 n n−1X m=0 Im. (5) To adapt to the change of contact patterns, and reduce the storage space for contact histories, a node may discard old history contacts; in this situation, the estimate would be based on only the retained history.",
                "The above probability is the direct contact probability of two nodes.",
                "We are also interested in the probability that we may be able to pass a message through a sequence of k nodes.",
                "We define the k-order probability inductively, p (k) ij = p (0) ij + X α p (0) iα p (k−1) αj , (6) where α is any node other than i or j. 3.1 Our Routing Protocol We first consider the case of a two-hop path, that is, with only one relay node.",
                "We consider two approaches: either the receiving neighbor decides whether to act as a relay, or the source decides which neighbors to use as relay. 3.1.1 Receiver Decision Whenever a node meets other nodes, they exchange all their messages (or as above, index messages).",
                "If the destination of a message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, if the probability of delivering the message to its destination through this receiver node within ΔT is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, the message is stored in the receivers storage to forward 1 In our simulation, however, we accurately model the communication costs and some short contacts will not succeed in transfer of all messages. to the destination.",
                "If the probability is less than the threshold, the receiver discards the message.",
                "Notice that our protocol replicates the message whenever a good-looking relay comes along. 3.1.2 Sender Decision To make decisions, a sender must have the information about its neighbors contact probability with a messages destination.",
                "Therefore, meta-data exchange is necessary.",
                "When two nodes meet, they exchange a meta-message, containing an unordered list of node IDs for which the sender of the metamessage has a contact probability greater than the threshold.",
                "After receiving a meta-message, a node checks whether it has any message that destined to its neighbor, or to a node in the node list of the neighbors meta-message.",
                "If it has, it sends a copy of the message.",
                "When a node receives a message, if the destination of the message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, the message is stored in the receivers storage for forwarding to the destination. 3.1.3 Multi-node Relay When we use more than two hops to relay a message, each node needs to know the contact probabilities along all possible paths to the message destination.",

                "Each message records the wireless card MAC address, the time of association/disassociation, and the name of the access point.",
                "We treat each unique MAC address as a node.",
                "For 37 more information about Dartmouths network and the data collection, see previous studies [7, 12].",
                "Our data are not contacts in a mobile ad-hoc network.",
                "We can approximate contact traces by assuming that two users can communicate with each other whenever they are associated with the same access point.",
                "Chaintreau et al. [5] used Dartmouth data traces and made the same assumption to theoretically analyze the impact of human mobility on opportunistic forwarding algorithms.",
                "This assumption may not be accurate,2 but it is a good first approximation.",
                "In our simulation, we imagine the same clients and same mobility in a network with no access points.",
                "Since our campus has full WiFi coverage, we assume that the location of access points had little impact on users mobility.",
                "We simulated one full month of trace data (November 2003) taken from CRAWDAD [13], with 5, 142 users.",
                "Although predictionbased protocols require prior contact history to estimate each nodes delivery probability, our preliminary results show that the performance improvement of warming-up over one month of trace was marginal.",
                "Therefore, for simplicity, we show the results of all protocols without warming-up. 4.2 Simulator We developed a custom simulator.3 Since we used contact traces derived from real mobility data, we did not need a mobility model and omitted physical and link-layer details for node discovery.",
                "We were aware that the time for neighbor discovery in different wireless technologies vary from less than one seconds to several seconds.",
                "Furthermore, connection establishment also takes time, such as DHCP.",
                "In our simulation, we assumed the nodes could discover and connect each other instantly when they were associated with a same AP.",
                "To accurately model communication costs, however, we simulated some MAC-layer behaviors, such as collision.",
                "The default settings of the network of our simulator are listed in Table 1, using the values recommended by other papers [22, 16].",
                "The message probability was the probability of generating messages, as described in Section 4.3.",
                "The default transmission bandwidth was 11 Mb/s.",
                "When one node tried to transmit a message, it first checked whether any nearby node was transmitting.",
                "If it was, the node backed off a random number of slots.",
                "Each slot was 1 millisecond, and the maximum number of backoff slots was 30.",
                "The size of messages was uniformly distributed between 80 bytes and 1024 bytes.",
                "The hop count limit (HCL) was the maximum number of hops before a message should stop forwarding.",
                "The time to live (TTL) was the maximum duration that a message may exist before expiring.",
                "The storage capacity was the maximum space that a node can use for storing messages.",
                "For our routing method, we used a default prediction window ΔT of 10 hours and a probability threshold of 0.01.",
                "The replication factor r was not limited by default, so the source of a message transferred the messages to any other node that had a contact probability with the message destination higher than the probability threshold. 4.3 Message generation After each contact event in the contact trace, we generated a message with a given probability; we choose a source node and a des2 Two nodes may not have been able to directly communicate while they were at two far sides of an access point, or two nodes may have been able to directly communicate if they were between two adjacent access points. 3 We tried to use a general network simulator (ns2), which was extremely slow when simulating a large number of mobile nodes (in our case, more than 5000 nodes), and provided unnecessary detail in modeling lower-level network protocols.",

                "We did not use proactive methods to notify nodes the delivery of messages, so that the messages can be removed from storage. 4.4 Metrics We define a set of metrics that we use in evaluating routing protocols in opportunistic networks: • delivery ratio, the ratio of the number of messages delivered to the number of total messages generated. • message transmissions, the total number of messages transmitted during the simulation across all nodes. 38 • meta-data transmissions, the total number of meta-data units transmitted during the simulation across all nodes. • message duplications, the number of times a message copy occurred, due to replication. • delay, the duration between a messages generation time and the messages delivery time. • storage usage, the max and mean of maximum storage (bytes) used across all nodes. 4.5 Results Here we compare simulation results of the six routing protocols. 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 unlimited 100 24 10 1 Deliveryratio Message time-to-live (TTL) (hour) direct random prediction state prophet epidemic Figure 2: Delivery ratio (log scale).",

                "Although we had 5,142 users in the network, the direct-delivery and random protocols had low delivery ratios (note the log scale).",
                "Even for messages with an unlimited lifetime, only 59 out of 2077 messages were delivered during this one-month simulation.",

                "The three prediction-based approaches had low delivery ratio, compared to epidemic routing.",
                "Although our method was slightly better than the other two, the advantage was marginal.",
                "The high delivery ratio of epidemic routing came with a price: excessive transmissions.",
                "Figure 3 shows the number of message data transmissions.",
                "The number of message transmissions of epidemic routing was more than 10 times higher than for the predictionbased routing protocols.",
                "Obviously, the direct delivery protocol had the lowest number of message transmissions - the number of message delivered.",
                "Among the three prediction-based methods, the PRoPHET transmitted fewer messages, but had comparable delivery-ratio as seen in Figure 2.",
                "Figure 4 shows that epidemic and all prediction-based methods had substantial meta-data transmissions, though epidemic routing had relatively more, with shorter TTLs.",

                "Although we are aware that wireless technologies differ, we assume that a node can reliably detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes.",
                "A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time.",
                "The contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other nodes.",
                "Node i has a contact history Hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j.",
                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network.",
                "The source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets.",
                "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",
                "Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.",
                "This protocol is simple, but may use significant resources; excessive communication may drain each nodes battery quickly.",
                "Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.",
                "At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.",
                "After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.",
                "An optimization to reduce the communication cost is to transfer index messages before transferring any data message.",
                "The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds.",
                "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
                "We use a simple <br>replication strategy</br> that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",
                "The message has some chance of being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires. 2.4 PRoPHET Protocol PRoPHET [16] is a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of past Encounters and Transitivity to estimate each nodes delivery probability for each other node.",
                "When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.",
                "Lindgren et al. [16] chose 0.75, as did we in our evaluation.",
                "When node i does not meet j for some time, the delivery probability decreases by pij = αk pij, (2) where α is the aging factor (α < 1), and k is the number of time units since the last update.",
                "The PRoPHET protocol exchanges index messages as well as delivery probabilities.",
                "When node i receives node js delivery probabilities, node i may compute the transitive delivery probability through j to z with piz = piz + (1 − piz)pijpjzβ, (3) where β is a design parameter for the impact of transitivity; we used β = 0.25 as did Lindgren [16]. 2.5 Link-State Protocol Su et al. [22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination.",
                "They use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged intercontact duration as the weight on links.",
                "The exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)I, (4) where I is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor.",
                "Nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight. 36 3.",
                "TIMELY-CONTACT PROBABILITY We also use historical contact information to estimate the probability of meeting other nodes in the future.",
                "But our method differs in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time.",
                "For example, what is the contact probability in the next hour?",
                "Neither PRoPHET nor Link-State considers time in this way.",
                "One way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the ratio of the total contact duration to the total time.",
                "However, this approach does not capture the frequency of contacts.",
                "For example, one node may have a long contact with another node, followed by a long non-contact period.",
                "A third node may have a short contact with the first node, followed by a short non-contact period.",
                "Using the above estimation approach, both examples would have similar contact probability.",
                "In the second example, however, the two nodes have more frequent contacts.",
                "We design a method to capture the contact frequency of mobile nodes.",
                "For this purpose, we assume that even short contacts are sufficient to exchange messages.1 The probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the following procedure.",
                "We divide the contact history Hi(j) into a sequence of n periods of ΔT starting from the start time (t0) of the first contact in history Hi(j) to the current time.",
                "We number each of the n periods from 0 to n − 1, then check each period.",
                "If node i had any contact with node j during a given period m, which is [t0 + mΔT, t0 + (m + 1)ΔT), we set the contact status Im to be 1; otherwise, the contact status Im is 0.",
                "The probability p (0) ij that node i meets node j in the next ΔT can be estimated as the average of the contact status in prior intervals: p (0) ij = 1 n n−1X m=0 Im. (5) To adapt to the change of contact patterns, and reduce the storage space for contact histories, a node may discard old history contacts; in this situation, the estimate would be based on only the retained history.",
                "The above probability is the direct contact probability of two nodes.",
                "We are also interested in the probability that we may be able to pass a message through a sequence of k nodes.",
                "We define the k-order probability inductively, p (k) ij = p (0) ij + X α p (0) iα p (k−1) αj , (6) where α is any node other than i or j. 3.1 Our Routing Protocol We first consider the case of a two-hop path, that is, with only one relay node.",
                "We consider two approaches: either the receiving neighbor decides whether to act as a relay, or the source decides which neighbors to use as relay. 3.1.1 Receiver Decision Whenever a node meets other nodes, they exchange all their messages (or as above, index messages).",
                "If the destination of a message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, if the probability of delivering the message to its destination through this receiver node within ΔT is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, the message is stored in the receivers storage to forward 1 In our simulation, however, we accurately model the communication costs and some short contacts will not succeed in transfer of all messages. to the destination.",
                "If the probability is less than the threshold, the receiver discards the message.",
                "Notice that our protocol replicates the message whenever a good-looking relay comes along. 3.1.2 Sender Decision To make decisions, a sender must have the information about its neighbors contact probability with a messages destination.",
                "Therefore, meta-data exchange is necessary.",
                "When two nodes meet, they exchange a meta-message, containing an unordered list of node IDs for which the sender of the metamessage has a contact probability greater than the threshold.",
                "After receiving a meta-message, a node checks whether it has any message that destined to its neighbor, or to a node in the node list of the neighbors meta-message.",
                "If it has, it sends a copy of the message.",
                "When a node receives a message, if the destination of the message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, the message is stored in the receivers storage for forwarding to the destination. 3.1.3 Multi-node Relay When we use more than two hops to relay a message, each node needs to know the contact probabilities along all possible paths to the message destination.",
                "Every node keeps a contact probability matrix, in which each cell pij is a contact probability between to nodes i and j.",
                "Each node i computes its own contact probabilities (row i) with other nodes using Equation (5) whenever the node ends a contact with other nodes.",
                "Each row of the contact probability matrix has a version number; the version number for row i is only increased when node i updates the matrix entries in row i.",
                "Other matrix entries are updated through exchange with other nodes when they meet.",
                "When two nodes i and j meet, they first exchange their contact probability matrices.",
                "Node i compares its own contact matrix with node js matrix.",
                "If node js matrix has a row l with a higher version number, then node i replaces its own row l with node js row l. Likewise node j updates its matrix.",
                "After the exchange, the two nodes will have identical contact probability matrices.",
                "Next, if a node has a message to forward, the node estimates its neighboring nodes order-k contact probability to contact the destination of the message using Equation (6).",
                "If p (k) ij is above a threshold, or if j is the destination of the message, node i will send a copy of the message to node j.",
                "All the above effort serves to determine the transfer probability when two nodes meet.",
                "The replication decision is orthogonal to the transfer decision.",

                "This assumption may not be accurate,2 but it is a good first approximation.",
                "In our simulation, we imagine the same clients and same mobility in a network with no access points.",
                "Since our campus has full WiFi coverage, we assume that the location of access points had little impact on users mobility.",
                "We simulated one full month of trace data (November 2003) taken from CRAWDAD [13], with 5, 142 users.",
                "Although predictionbased protocols require prior contact history to estimate each nodes delivery probability, our preliminary results show that the performance improvement of warming-up over one month of trace was marginal.",
                "Therefore, for simplicity, we show the results of all protocols without warming-up. 4.2 Simulator We developed a custom simulator.3 Since we used contact traces derived from real mobility data, we did not need a mobility model and omitted physical and link-layer details for node discovery.",
                "We were aware that the time for neighbor discovery in different wireless technologies vary from less than one seconds to several seconds.",
                "Furthermore, connection establishment also takes time, such as DHCP.",

                "Two extremes are the direct-delivery protocol and the epidemic protocol.",
                "The former transfers with probability 1 when the node meets the destination, 0 for others, and no replication.",
                "The latter uses transfer probability 1 for all nodes and unlimited replication.",
                "Both these protocols have their advantages and disadvantages.",
                "All other protocols are between the two extremes.",
                "First, we define the notion of contact between two nodes.",
                "Then we describe five existing protocols before presenting our own proposal.",

                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network.",
                "The source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets.",
                "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",
                "Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.",

                "Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.",
                "At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.",
                "After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.",

                "The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds.",
                "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
                "We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",

                "When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.",

[22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination.",
                "They use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged intercontact duration as the weight on links.",
                "The exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)I, (4) where I is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor.",
                "Nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight. 36 3.",
                "TIMELY-CONTACT PROBABILITY We also use historical contact information to estimate the probability of meeting other nodes in the future.",
                "But our method differs in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time.",
                "For example, what is the contact probability in the next hour?",
                "Neither PRoPHET nor Link-State considers time in this way.",
                "One way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the ratio of the total contact duration to the total time.",
                "However, this approach does not capture the frequency of contacts.",
                "For example, one node may have a long contact with another node, followed by a long non-contact period.",
                "A third node may have a short contact with the first node, followed by a short non-contact period.",
                "Using the above estimation approach, both examples would have similar contact probability.",
                "In the second example, however, the two nodes have more frequent contacts.",
                "We design a method to capture the contact frequency of mobile nodes.",
                "For this purpose, we assume that even short contacts are sufficient to exchange messages.1 The probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the following procedure.",
                "We divide the contact history Hi(j) into a sequence of n periods of ΔT starting from the start time (t0) of the first contact in history Hi(j) to the current time.",
                "We number each of the n periods from 0 to n − 1, then check each period.",
                "If node i had any contact with node j during a given period m, which is [t0 + mΔT, t0 + (m + 1)ΔT), we set the contact status Im to be 1; otherwise, the contact status Im is 0.",
                "The probability p (0) ij that node i meets node j in the next ΔT can be estimated as the average of the contact status in prior intervals: p (0) ij = 1 n n−1X m=0 Im. (5) To adapt to the change of contact patterns, and reduce the storage space for contact histories, a node may discard old history contacts; in this situation, the estimate would be based on only the retained history.",

                "We consider two approaches: either the receiving neighbor decides whether to act as a relay, or the source decides which neighbors to use as relay. 3.1.1 Receiver Decision Whenever a node meets other nodes, they exchange all their messages (or as above, index messages).",

                "Notice that our protocol replicates the message whenever a good-looking relay comes along. 3.1.2 Sender Decision To make decisions, a sender must have the information about its neighbors contact probability with a messages destination.",

                "When a node receives a message, if the destination of the message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, the message is stored in the receivers storage for forwarding to the destination. 3.1.3 Multi-node Relay When we use more than two hops to relay a message, each node needs to know the contact probabilities along all possible paths to the message destination.",

                "Although we are aware that wireless technologies differ, we assume that a node can reliably detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes.",
                "A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time.",
                "The contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other nodes.",
                "Node i has a contact history Hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j.",
                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network.",

                "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",
                "Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.",
                "This protocol is simple, but may use significant resources; excessive communication may drain each nodes battery quickly.",
                "Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.",
                "At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.",
                "After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.",

                "The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds.",
                "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
                "We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",
                "The message has some chance of being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires. 2.4 <br>prophet</br> Protocol <br>prophet</br> [16] is a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of past Encounters and Transitivity to estimate each nodes delivery probability for each other node.",
                "When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.",

                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",

                "First, we define the notion of contact between two nodes.",
                "Then we describe five existing protocols before presenting our own proposal.",
                "A contact is defined as a period of time during which two nodes have the opportunity to communicate.",
                "Although we are aware that wireless technologies differ, we assume that a node can reliably detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes.",
                "A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time.",
                "The contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other nodes.",
                "Node i has a contact history Hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j.",
                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network.",
                "The source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets.",
                "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",
                "Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.",
                "This protocol is simple, but may use significant resources; excessive communication may drain each nodes battery quickly.",
                "Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.",
                "At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.",
                "After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.",
                "An optimization to reduce the communication cost is to transfer index messages before transferring any data message.",
                "The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds.",
                "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
                "We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",
                "The message has some chance of being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires. 2.4 PRoPHET Protocol PRoPHET [16] is a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of past Encounters and Transitivity to estimate each nodes delivery probability for each other node.",
                "When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.",
                "Lindgren et al. [16] chose 0.75, as did we in our evaluation.",
                "When node i does not meet j for some time, the delivery probability decreases by pij = αk pij, (2) where α is the aging factor (α < 1), and k is the number of time units since the last update.",
                "The PRoPHET protocol exchanges index messages as well as delivery probabilities.",
                "When node i receives node js delivery probabilities, node i may compute the transitive delivery probability through j to z with piz = piz + (1 − piz)pijpjzβ, (3) where β is a design parameter for the impact of transitivity; we used β = 0.25 as did Lindgren [16]. 2.5 Link-State Protocol Su et al. [22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination.",
                "They use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged intercontact duration as the weight on links.",
                "The exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)I, (4) where I is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor.",
                "Nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight. 36 3.",
                "TIMELY-CONTACT PROBABILITY We also use historical contact information to estimate the probability of meeting other nodes in the future.",
                "But our method differs in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time.",
                "For example, what is the contact probability in the next hour?",
                "Neither PRoPHET nor Link-State considers time in this way.",
                "One way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the ratio of the total contact duration to the total time.",
                "However, this approach does not capture the frequency of contacts.",
                "For example, one node may have a long contact with another node, followed by a long non-contact period.",
                "A third node may have a short contact with the first node, followed by a short non-contact period.",
                "Using the above estimation approach, both examples would have similar contact probability.",
                "In the second example, however, the two nodes have more frequent contacts.",
                "We design a method to capture the contact frequency of mobile nodes.",
                "For this purpose, we assume that even short contacts are sufficient to exchange messages.1 The probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the following procedure.",
                "We divide the contact history Hi(j) into a sequence of n periods of ΔT starting from the start time (t0) of the first contact in history Hi(j) to the current time.",
                "We number each of the n periods from 0 to n − 1, then check each period.",

                "Although we are aware that wireless technologies differ, we assume that a node can reliably detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes.",
                "A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time.",
                "The contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other nodes.",
                "Node i has a contact history Hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j.",
                "We record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the nodes contact history may not have ended. 2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.",
                "In mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero. 2.2 Epidemic Routing Protocol The epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the network.",
                "The source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets.",
                "The nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.",
                "Eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.",
                "This protocol is simple, but may use significant resources; excessive communication may drain each nodes battery quickly.",
                "Moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.",
                "At a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.",
                "After a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.",
                "An optimization to reduce the communication cost is to transfer index messages before transferring any data message.",
                "The index messages contain IDs of messages that a node currently holds.",
                "Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes. 2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.",
                "We use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.",
                "The message has some chance of being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires. 2.4 PRoPHET Protocol PRoPHET [16] is a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of past Encounters and Transitivity to estimate each nodes delivery probability for each other node.",
                "When node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.",
                "Lindgren et al. [16] chose 0.75, as did we in our evaluation.",
                "When node i does not meet j for some time, the delivery probability decreases by pij = αk pij, (2) where α is the aging factor (α < 1), and k is the number of time units since the last update.",

                "When node i receives node js delivery probabilities, node i may compute the transitive delivery probability through j to z with piz = piz + (1 − piz)pijpjzβ, (3) where β is a design parameter for the impact of transitivity; we used β = 0.25 as did Lindgren [16]. 2.5 Link-State Protocol Su et al. [22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination.",
                "They use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged intercontact duration as the weight on links.",
                "The exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)I, (4) where I is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor.",
                "Nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight. 36 3.",
                "TIMELY-CONTACT PROBABILITY We also use historical contact information to estimate the probability of meeting other nodes in the future.",
                "But our method differs in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time.",
                "For example, what is the contact probability in the next hour?",
                "Neither PRoPHET nor Link-State considers time in this way.",
                "One way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the ratio of the total contact duration to the total time.",
                "However, this approach does not capture the frequency of contacts.",
                "For example, one node may have a long contact with another node, followed by a long non-contact period.",
                "A third node may have a short contact with the first node, followed by a short non-contact period.",
                "Using the above estimation approach, both examples would have similar contact probability.",
                "In the second example, however, the two nodes have more frequent contacts.",
                "We design a method to capture the contact frequency of mobile nodes.",
                "For this purpose, we assume that even short contacts are sufficient to exchange messages.1 The probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the following procedure.",
                "We divide the contact history Hi(j) into a sequence of n periods of ΔT starting from the start time (t0) of the first contact in history Hi(j) to the current time.",
                "We number each of the n periods from 0 to n − 1, then check each period.",
                "If node i had any contact with node j during a given period m, which is [t0 + mΔT, t0 + (m + 1)ΔT), we set the contact status Im to be 1; otherwise, the contact status Im is 0.",
                "The probability p (0) ij that node i meets node j in the next ΔT can be estimated as the average of the contact status in prior intervals: p (0) ij = 1 n n−1X m=0 Im. (5) To adapt to the change of contact patterns, and reduce the storage space for contact histories, a node may discard old history contacts; in this situation, the estimate would be based on only the retained history.",
                "The above probability is the direct contact probability of two nodes.",
                "We are also interested in the probability that we may be able to pass a message through a sequence of k nodes.",
                "We define the k-order probability inductively, p (k) ij = p (0) ij + X α p (0) iα p (k−1) αj , (6) where α is any node other than i or j. 3.1 Our Routing Protocol We first consider the case of a two-hop path, that is, with only one relay node.",
                "We consider two approaches: either the receiving neighbor decides whether to act as a relay, or the source decides which neighbors to use as relay. 3.1.1 Receiver Decision Whenever a node meets other nodes, they exchange all their messages (or as above, index messages).",
                "If the destination of a message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, if the probability of delivering the message to its destination through this receiver node within ΔT is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, the message is stored in the receivers storage to forward 1 In our <br>simulation</br>, however, we accurately model the communication costs and some short contacts will not succeed in transfer of all messages. to the destination.",
                "If the probability is less than the threshold, the receiver discards the message.",
                "Notice that our protocol replicates the message whenever a good-looking relay comes along. 3.1.2 Sender Decision To make decisions, a sender must have the information about its neighbors contact probability with a messages destination.",
                "Therefore, meta-data exchange is necessary.",
                "When two nodes meet, they exchange a meta-message, containing an unordered list of node IDs for which the sender of the metamessage has a contact probability greater than the threshold.",
                "After receiving a meta-message, a node checks whether it has any message that destined to its neighbor, or to a node in the node list of the neighbors meta-message.",
                "If it has, it sends a copy of the message.",
                "When a node receives a message, if the destination of the message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.",
                "Otherwise, the message is stored in the receivers storage for forwarding to the destination. 3.1.3 Multi-node Relay When we use more than two hops to relay a message, each node needs to know the contact probabilities along all possible paths to the message destination.",

                "Each message records the wireless card MAC address, the time of association/disassociation, and the name of the access point.",
                "We treat each unique MAC address as a node.",
                "For 37 more information about Dartmouths network and the data collection, see previous studies [7, 12].",

                "Chaintreau et al. [5] used Dartmouth data traces and made the same assumption to theoretically analyze the impact of human mobility on opportunistic forwarding algorithms.",
                "This assumption may not be accurate,2 but it is a good first approximation.",
                "In our <br>simulation</br>, we imagine the same clients and same mobility in a network with no access points.",
                "Since our campus has full WiFi coverage, we assume that the location of access points had little impact on users mobility.",
                "We simulated one full month of trace data (November 2003) taken from CRAWDAD [13], with 5, 142 users.",
                "Although predictionbased protocols require prior contact history to estimate each nodes delivery probability, our preliminary results show that the performance improvement of warming-up over one month of trace was marginal.",
                "Therefore, for simplicity, we show the results of all protocols without warming-up. 4.2 Simulator We developed a custom simulator.3 Since we used contact traces derived from real mobility data, we did not need a mobility model and omitted physical and link-layer details for node discovery.",
                "We were aware that the time for neighbor discovery in different wireless technologies vary from less than one seconds to several seconds.",

                "If it was, the node backed off a random number of slots.",
                "Each slot was 1 millisecond, and the maximum number of backoff slots was 30.",
                "The size of messages was uniformly distributed between 80 bytes and 1024 bytes.",
                "The hop count limit (HCL) was the maximum number of hops before a message should stop forwarding.",
                "The time to live (TTL) was the maximum duration that a message may exist before expiring.",
                "The storage capacity was the maximum space that a node can use for storing messages.",
                "For our routing method, we used a default prediction window ΔT of 10 hours and a probability threshold of 0.01.",
                "The replication factor r was not limited by default, so the source of a message transferred the messages to any other node that had a contact probability with the message destination higher than the probability threshold. 4.3 Message generation After each contact event in the contact trace, we generated a message with a given probability; we choose a source node and a des2 Two nodes may not have been able to directly communicate while they were at two far sides of an access point, or two nodes may have been able to directly communicate if they were between two adjacent access points. 3 We tried to use a general network simulator (ns2), which was extremely slow when simulating a large number of mobile nodes (in our case, more than 5000 nodes), and provided unnecessary detail in modeling lower-level network protocols.",

                "Although our method was slightly better than the other two, the advantage was marginal.",
                "The high delivery ratio of epidemic routing came with a price: excessive transmissions.",

                "The number of message transmissions of epidemic routing was more than 10 times higher than for the predictionbased routing protocols.",
