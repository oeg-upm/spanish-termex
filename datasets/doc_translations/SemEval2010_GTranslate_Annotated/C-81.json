In this paper, we present an adaptive duty cycling algorithm that allows energy harvesting sensor nodes to autonomously adjust their duty cycle according to the energy availability in the environment. The algorithm has three objectives, namely (a) achieving energy neutral operation, i.e., energy consumption should not be more than the energy provided by the environment, (b) maximizing the system performance based on an application utility model subject to the above energyneutrality constraint, and (c) adapting to the dynamics of the energy source at run-time. We present a model that enables harvesting sensor nodes to predict future energy opportunities based on historical data. We also derive an upper bound on the maximum achievable performance assuming perfect knowledge about the future behavior of the energy source. Our methods are evaluated using data gathered from a prototype solar energy harvesting platform and we show that our algorithm can utilize up to 58% more environmental energy compared to the case when harvesting-aware power management is not used.

INTRODUCTION Energy supply has always been a crucial issue in designing battery-powered wireless sensor networks because the lifetime and utility of the systems are limited by how long the batteries are able to sustain the operation. The fidelity of the data produced by a sensor network begins to degrade once sensor nodes start to run out of battery power. Therefore, harvesting energy from the environment has been proposed to supplement or completely replace battery supplies to enhance system lifetime and reduce the maintenance cost of replacing batteries periodically. However, metrics for evaluating energy harvesting systems are different from those used for battery powered systems. Environmental energy is distinct from battery energy in two ways. First it is an inexhaustible supply which, if appropriately used, can allow the system to last forever, unlike the battery which is a limited resource. Second, there is an uncertainty associated with its availability and measurement, compared to the energy stored in the battery which can be known deterministically. Thus, power management methods based on battery status are not always applicable to energy harvesting systems. In addition, most power management schemes designed for battery-powered systems only account for the dynamics of the energy consumers (e.g., CPU, radio) but not the dynamics of the energy supply. Consequently, battery powered systems usually operate at the lowest performance level that meets the minimum data fidelity requirement in order to maximize the system life. Energy harvesting systems, on the other hand, can provide enhanced performance depending on the available energy. In this paper, we will study how to adapt the performance of the available energy profile. There exist many techniques to accomplish performance scaling at the node level, such as radio transmit power adjustment [1], dynamic voltage scaling [2], and the use of low power modes [3]. However, these techniques require hardware support and may not always be available on resource constrained sensor nodes. Alternatively, a common performance scaling technique is duty cycling. Low power devices typically provide at least one low power mode in which the node is shut down and the power consumption is negligible. In addition, the rate of duty cycling is directly related to system performance metrics such as network latency and sampling frequency. We will use duty cycle adjustment as the primitive performance scaling technique in our algorithms. 2. RELATED WORK Energy harvesting has been explored for several different types of systems, such as wearable computers [4], [5], [6], sensor networks [7], etc. Several technologies to extract energy from the environment have been demonstrated including solar, motion-based, biochemical, vibration-based [8], [9], [10], [11], and others are being developed [12], [13]. While several energy harvesting sensor node platforms have been prototyped [14], [15], [16], there is a need for systematic power management techniques that provide performance guarantees during system operation. The first work to take environmental energy into account for data routing was [17], followed by [18]. While these works did demonstrate that environment aware decisions improve performance compared to battery aware decisions, their objective was not to achieve energy neutral operation. Our proposed techniques attempt to maximize system performance while maintaining energy-neutral operation. 3. SYSTEM MODEL The energy usage considerations in a harvesting system vary significantly from those in a battery powered system, as mentioned earlier. We propose the model shown in Figure 1 for designing energy management methods in a harvesting system. The functions of the various blocks shown in the figure are discussed below. The precise methods used in our system to achieve these functions will be discussed in subsequent sections. Harvested Energy Tracking: This block represents the mechanisms used to measure the energy received from the harvesting device, such as the solar panel. Such information is useful for determining the energy availability profile and adapting system performance based on it. Collecting this information requires that the node hardware be equipped with the facility to measure the power generated from the environment, and the Heliomote platform [14] we used for evaluating the algorithms has this capability. Energy Generation Model: For wireless sensor nodes with limited storage and processing capabilities to be able to use the harvested energy data, models that represent the essential components of this information without using extensive storage are required. The purpose of this block is to provide a model for the energy available to the system in a form that may be used for making power management decisions. The data measured by the energy tracking block is used here to predict future energy availability. A good prediction model should have a low prediction error and provide predicted energy values for durations long enough to make meaningful performance scaling decisions. Further, for energy sources that exhibit both long-term and short-term patterns (e.g., diurnal and climate variations vs. weather patterns for solar energy), the model must be able to capture both characteristics. Such a model can also use information from external sources such as local weather forecast service to improve its accuracy. Energy Consumption Model: It is also important to have detailed information about the energy usage characteristics of the system, at various performance levels. For general applicability of our design, we will assume that only one sleep mode is available. We assume that the power consumption in the sleep and active modes is known. It may be noted that for low power systems with more advanced capabilities such as dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), multiple low power modes, and the capability to shut down system components selectively, the power consumption in each of the states and the resultant effect on application performance should be known to make power management decisions. Energy Storage Model: This block represents the model for the energy storage technology. Since all the generated energy may not be used instantaneously, the harvesting system will usually have some energy storage technology. Storage technologies (e.g., batteries and ultra-capacitors) are non-ideal, in that there is some energy loss while storing and retrieving energy from them. These characteristics must be known to efficiently manage energy usage and storage. This block also includes the system capability to measure the residual stored energy. Most low power systems use batteries to store energy and provide residual battery status. This is commonly based on measuring the battery voltage which is then mapped to the residual battery energy using the known charge to voltage relationship for the battery technology in use. More sophisticated methods which track the flow of energy into and out of the battery are also available. Harvesting-aware Power Management: The inputs provided by the previously mentioned blocks are used here to determine the suitable power management strategy for the system. Power management could be carried to meet different objectives in different applications. For instance, in some systems, the harvested energy may marginally supplement the battery supply and the objective may be to maximize the system lifetime. A more interesting case is when the harvested energy is used as the primary source of energy for the system with the objective of achieving indefinitely long system lifetime. In such cases, the power management objective is to achieve energy neutral operation. In other words, the system should only use as much energy as harvested from the environment and attempt to maximize performance within this available energy budget. 4. THEORETICALLY OPTIMAL POWER MANAGEMENT We develop the following theory to understand the energy neutral mode of operation. Let us define Ps(t) as the energy harvested from the environment at time t, and the energy being consumed by the load at that time is Pc(t). Further, we model the non-ideal storage buffer by its round-trip efficiency η (strictly less than 1) and a constant leakage power Pleak. Using this notation, applying the rule of energy conservation leads to the following inequality: 0 0 00 [ ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] 0 T T T s c c s leakP t P t dt P t P t dt P dtB η + + − − − ≥+ −∫ ∫ ∫ (1) where B0 is the initial battery level and the function [X]+ = X if X > 0 and zero otherwise. DEFINITION 1 (ρ,σ1,σ2) function: A non-negative, continuous and bounded function P (t) is said to be a (ρ,σ1,σ2) function if and only if for any value of finite real number T , the following are satisfied: 2 1( ) T T P t dt Tρ σ ρ σ− ≤ ≤ +∫ (2) This function can be used to model both energy sources and loads. If the harvested energy profile Ps(t) is a (ρ1,σ1,σ2) function, then the average rate of available energy over long durations becomes ρ1, and the burstiness is bounded by σ1 and σ2 . Similarly, Pc(t) can be modeled as a (ρ2,σ3) function, when ρ2 and σ3 are used to place an upper bound on power consumption (the inequality on the right side) while there are no minimum power consumption constraints. The condition for energy neutrality, equation (1), leads to the following theorem, based on the energy production, consumption, and energy buffer models discussed above. THEOREM 1 (ENERGY NEUTRAL OPERATION): Consider a harvesting system in which the energy production profile is characterized by a (ρ1, σ1, σ2) function, the load is characterized by a (ρ2, σ3) function and the energy buffer is characterized by parameters η for storage efficiency, and Pleak for leakage power. The following conditions are sufficient for the system to achieve energy neutrality: ρ2 ≤ ηρ1 − Pleak (3) B0 ≥ ησ2 + σ3 (4) B ≥ B0 (5) where B0 is the initial energy stored in the buffer and provides a lower bound on the capacity of the energy buffer B. The proof is presented in our prior work [19]. To adjust the duty cycle D using our performance scaling algorithm, we assume the following relation between duty cycle and the perceived utility of the system to the user: Suppose the utility of the application to the user is represented by U(D) when the system operates at a duty cycle D. Then, min 1 min max 2 max ( ) 0, ( ) , ( ) , U D if D D U D k D if D D D U D k if D D β = < = + ≤ ≤ = > This is a fairly general and simple model and the specific values of Dmin and Dmax may be determined as per application requirements. As an example, consider a sensor node designed to detect intrusion across a periphery. In this case, a linear increase in duty cycle translates into a linear increase in the detection probability. The fastest and the slowest speeds of the intruders may be known, leading to a minimum and Harvested Energy Tracking Energy Consumption Model Energy Storage Model Harvestingaware Power Mangement Energy Generation Model LOAD Figure 1. System model for an energy harvesting system. 181 maximum sensing delay tolerable, which results in the relevant Dmax and Dmin for the sensor node. While there may be cases where the relationship between utility and duty cycle may be non-linear, in this paper, we restrict our focus on applications that follow this linear model. In view of the above models for the system components and the required performance, the objective of our power management strategy is adjust the duty cycle D(i) dynamically so as to maximize the total utility U(D) over a period of time, while ensuring energy neutral operation for the sensor node. Before discussing the performance scaling methods for harvesting aware duty cycle adaptation, let us first consider the optimal power management strategy that is possible for a given energy generation profile. For the calculation of the optimal strategy, we assume complete knowledge of the energy availability profile at the node, including the availability in the future. The calculation of the optimal is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of our proposed algorithm. This is particularly useful for our algorithm since no prior algorithms are available to serve as a baseline for comparison. Suppose the time axis is partitioned into discrete slots of duration ΔT, and the duty cycle adaptation calculation is carried out over a window of Nw such time slots. We define the following energy profile variables, with the index i ranging over {1,…, Nw}: Ps(i) is the power output from the harvested source in time slot i, averaged over the slot duration, Pc is the power consumption of the load in active mode, and D(i) is the duty cycle used in slot i, whose value is to be determined. B(i) is the residual battery energy at the beginning of slot i. Following this convention, the battery energy left after the last slot in the window is represented by B(Nw+1). The values of these variables will depend on the choice of D(i). The energy used directly from the harvested source and the energy stored and used from the battery must be accounted for differently. Figure 2 shows two possible cases for Ps(i) in a time slot. Ps(i) may either be less than or higher than Pc , as shown on the left and right respectively. When Ps(i) is lower than Pc, some of the energy used by the load comes from the battery, while when Ps(i) is higher than Pc, all the energy used is supplied directly from the harvested source. The crosshatched area shows the energy that is available for storage into the battery while the hashed area shows the energy drawn from the battery. We can write the energy used from the battery in any slot i as: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )[ ] ( ) ( ){ } ( ) ( )[ ]1 1c cs s sB i B i TD i P P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η + + − + = Δ − − Δ − − − (6) In equation (6), the first term on the right hand side measures the energy drawn from the battery when Ps(i) < Pc, the next term measures the energy stored into the battery when the node is in sleep mode, and the last term measures the energy stored into the battery in active mode if Ps(i) > Pc. For energy neutral operation, we require the battery at the end of the window of Nw slots to be greater than or equal to the starting battery. Clearly, battery level will go down when the harvested energy is not available and the system is operated from stored energy. However, the window Nw is judiciously chosen such that over that duration, we expect the environmental energy availability to complete a periodic cycle. For instance, in the case of solar energy harvesting, Nw could be chosen to be a twenty-four hour duration, corresponding to the diurnal cycle in the harvested energy. This is an approximation since an ideal choice of the window size would be infinite, but a finite size must be used for analytical tractability. Further, the battery level cannot be negative at any time, and this is ensured by having a large enough initial battery level B0 such that node operation is sustained even in the case of total blackout during a window period. Stating the above constraints quantitatively, we can express the calculation of the optimal duty cycles as an optimization problem below: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = ∑ (7) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ){ } ( ) ( )1 1c s s s cB i B i TD i P P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η + + ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤− + = Δ − − Δ − − −⎣ ⎦ ⎣ ⎦ (8) 0(1)B B= (9) 0( 1)wB N B+ ≥ (10) min w( ) i {1,...,N }D i D≥ ∀ ∈ (11) max w( ) i {1,...,N }D i D≤ ∀ ∈ (12) The solution to the optimization problem yields the duty cycles that must be used in every slot and the evolution of residual battery over the course of Nw slots. Note that while the constraints above contain the non-linear function [x]+ , the quantities occurring within that function are all known constants. The variable quantities occur only in linear terms and hence the above optimization problem can be solved using standard linear programming techniques, available in popular optimization toolboxes. 5. HARVESTING-AWARE POWER MANAGEMENT We now present a practical algorithm for power management that may be used for adapting the performance based on harvested energy information. This algorithm attempts to achieve energy neutral operation without using knowledge of the future energy availability and maximizes the achievable performance within that constraint. The harvesting-aware power management strategy consists of three parts. The first part is an instantiation of the energy generation model which tracks past energy input profiles and uses them to predict future energy availability. The second part computes the optimal duty cycles based on the predicted energy, and this step uses our computationally tractable method to solve the optimization problem. The third part consists of a method to dynamically adapt the duty cycle in response to the observed energy generation profile in real time. This step is required since the observed energy generation may deviate significantly from the predicted energy availability and energy neutral operation must be ensured with the actual energy received rather than the predicted values. 5.1. Energy Prediction Model We use a prediction model based on Exponentially Weighted Moving-Average (EWMA). The method is designed to exploit the diurnal cycle in solar energy but at the same time adapt to the seasonal variations. A historical summary of the energy generation profile is maintained for this purpose. While the storage data size is limited to a vector length of Nw values in order to minimize the memory overheads of the power management algorithm, the window size is effectively infinite as each value in the history window depends on all the observed data up to that instant. The window size is chosen to be 24 hours and each time slot is taken to be 30 minutes as the variation in generated power by the solar panel using this setting is less than 10% between each adjacent slots. This yields Nw = 48. Smaller slot durations may be used at the expense of a higher Nw. The historical summary maintained is derived as follows. On a typical day, we expect the energy generation to be similar to the energy generation at the same time on the previous days. The value of energy generated in a particular slot is maintained as a weighted average of the energy received in the same time-slot during all observed days. The weights are exponential, resulting in decaying contribution from older Figure 2. Two possible cases for energy calculations Slot i Slot k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Active Sleep 182 data. More specifically, the historical average maintained for each slot is given by: 1 (1 )k k kx x xα α−= + − where α is the value of the weighting factor, kx is the observed value of energy generated in the slot, and 1kx − is the previously stored historical average. In this model, the importance of each day relative to the previous one remains constant because the same weighting factor was used for all days. The average value derived for a slot is treated as an estimate of predicted energy value for the slot corresponding to the subsequent day. This method helps the historical average values adapt to the seasonal variations in energy received on different days. One of the parameters to be chosen in the above prediction method is the parameter α, which is a measure of rate of shift in energy pattern over time. Since this parameter is affected by the characteristics of the energy and sensor node location, the system should have a training period during which this parameter will be determined. To determine a good value of α, we collected energy data over 72 days and compared the average error of the prediction method for various values of α. The error based on the different values of α is shown in Figure 3. This curve suggests an optimum value of α = 0.15 for minimum prediction error and this value will be used in the remainder of this paper. 5.2. Low-complexity Solution The energy values predicted for the next window of Nw slots are used to calculated the desired duty cycles for the next window, assuming the predicted values match the observed values in the future. Since our objective is to develop a practical algorithm for embedded computing systems, we present a simplified method to solve the linear programming problem presented in Section 4. To this end, we define the sets S and D as follows: { } { } | ( ) 0 | ( ) 0 s c c s S i P i P D i P P i = − ≥ = − > The two sets differ by the condition that whether the node operation can be sustained entirely from environmental energy. In the case that energy produced from the environment is not sufficient, battery will be discharged to supplement the remaining energy. Next we sum up both sides of (6) over the entire Nw window and rewrite it with the new notation. 1 1 1 1 ( )[ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )[ ( ) ] Nw Nw Nw i i c s s s s c i i D i i i S B B TD i P P i TP i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η η+ = ∈ = = ∈ − = Δ − − Δ + Δ − Δ −∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ The term on the left hand side is actually the battery energy used over the entire window of Nw slots, which can be set to 0 for energy neutral operation. After some algebraic manipulation, this yields: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i i D i S P P i D i P i P D i η η= ∈ ∈ ⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞ = + − +⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠ ∑ ∑ ∑ (13) The term on the left hand side is the total energy received in Nw slots. The first term on the right hand side can be interpreted as the total energy consumed during the D slots and the second term is the total energy consumed during the S slots. We can now replace three constraints (8), (9), and (10) in the original problem with (13), restating the optimization problem as follows: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = ∑ 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) Nw c s s c i i D i S P P i D i P i P D i η η= ∈ ∈ ⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞ = + − +⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠ ∑ ∑ ∑ min max D(i) D {1,...,Nw) D(i) D {1,...,Nw) i i ≥ ∀ ∈ ≤ ∀ ∈ This form facilitates a low complexity solution that doesnt require a general linear programming solver. Since our objective is to maximize the total system utility, it is preferable to set the duty cycle to Dmin for time slots where the utility per unit energy is the least. On the other hand, we would also like the time slots with the highest Ps to operate at Dmax because of better efficiency of using energy directly from the energy source. Combining these two characteristics, we define the utility co-efficient for each slot i as follows: 1 ( ) 1 1 ( ) 1 c c s P for i S W i P P i for i D η η ∈⎧ ⎪ = ⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞⎨ + − ∈⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟⎪ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠⎩ where W(i) is a representation of how efficient the energy usage in a particular time slot i is. A larger W(i) indicates more system utility per unit energy in slot i and vice versa. The algorithm starts by assuming D(i) =Dmin for i = {1…NW} because of the minimum duty cycle requirement, and computes the remaining system energy R by: 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) (14) Nw c s s c i i D i S P R P i D i P i P D i η η= ∈ ∈ ⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞ = − + − −⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠ ∑ ∑ ∑ A negative R concludes that the optimization problem is infeasible, meaning the system cannot achieve energy neutrality even at the minimum duty cycle. In this case, the system designer is responsible for increasing the environment energy availability (e.g., by using larger solar panels). If R is positive, it means the system has excess energy that is not being used, and this may be allocated to increase the duty cycle beyond Dmin for some slots. Since our objective is to maximize the total system utility, the most efficient way to allocate the excess energy is to assign duty cycle Dmax to the slots with the highest W(i). So, the coefficients W(i) are arranged in decreasing order and duty cycle Dmax is assigned to the slots beginning with the largest coefficients until the excess energy available, R (computed by (14) in every iteration), is insufficient to assign Dmax to another slot. The remaining energy, RLast, is used to increase the duty cycle to some value between Dmin and Dmax in the slot with the next lower coefficient.

Slot-by-slot continual duty cycle adaptiation. The observed energy values may vary greatly from the predicted ones, such as due to the effect of clouds or other sudden changes. It is thus important to adapt the duty cycles calculated using the predicted values, to the actual energy measurements in real time to ensure energy neutrality. Denote the initial duty cycle assignments for each time slot i computed using the predicted energy values as D(i) = {1, ...,Nw}. First we compute the difference between predicted power level Ps(i) and actual power level observed, Ps(i) in every slot i. Then, the excess energy in slot i, denoted by X, can be obtained as follows: ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( )[ ( ) ( )](1 ) ( ) s s s c s s s s s c P i P i if P i P X P i P i D i P i P i if P i P η − >⎧ ⎪ = ⎨ − − − − ≤⎪ ⎩ 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3 alpha AvgError(mA) Figure 3. Choice of prediction parameter. 183 The upper term accounts for the energy difference when actual received energy is more than the power drawn by the load. On the other hand, if the energy received is less than Pc, we will need to account for the extra energy used from the battery by the load, which is a function of duty cycle used in time slot i and battery efficiency factor η. When more energy is received than predicted, X is positive and that excess energy is available for use in the subsequent solutes, while if X is negative, that energy must be compensated from subsequent slots. CASE I: X<0. In this case, we want to reduce the duty cycles used in the future slots in order to make up for this shortfall of energy. Since our objective function is to maximize the total system utility, we have to reduce the duty cycles for time slots with the smallest normalized utility coefficient, W(i). This is accomplished by first sorting the coefficient W(j) ,where j>i. in decreasing order, and then iteratively reducing Dj to Dmin until the total reduction in energy consumption is the same as X. CASE II: X>0. Here, we want to increase the duty cycles used in the future to utilize this excess energy we received in recent time slot. In contrast to Case I, the duty cycles of future time slots with highest utility coefficient W(i) should be increased first in order to maximize the total system utility. Suppose the duty cycle is changed by d in slot j. Define a quantity R(j,d) as follows: ⎪ ⎩ ⎪ ⎨ ⎧ <=⎟ ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ −+ >⋅ = lji l ljl PPifP P d PPifP djR 　　　 1 1 　　d　　 ),( ηη The precise procedure to adapt the duty cycle to account for the above factors is presented in Algorithm 1. This calculation is performed at the end of every slot to set the duty cycle for the next slot. We claim that our duty cycling algorithm is energy neutral because an surplus of energy at the previous time slot will always translate to additional energy opportunity for future time slots, and vice versa. The claim may be violated in cases of severe energy shortages especially towards the end of window. For example, a large deficit in energy supply cant be restored if there is no future energy input until the end of the window. In such case, this offset will be carried over to the next window so that long term energy neutrality is still maintained. 6. EVALUATION Our adaptive duty cycling algorithm was evaluated using an actual solar energy profile measured using a sensor node called Heliomote, capable of harvesting solar energy [14]. This platform not only tracks the generated energy but also the energy flow into and out of the battery to provide an accurate estimate of the stored energy. The energy harvesting platform was deployed in a residential area in Los Angeles from the beginning of June through the middle of August for a total of 72 days. The sensor node used is a Mica2 mote running at a fixed 40% duty cycle with an initially full battery. Battery voltage and net current from the solar panels are sampled at a period of 10 seconds. The energy generation profile for that duration, measured by tracking the output current from the solar cell is shown in Figure 4, both on continuous and diurnal scales. We can observe that although the energy profile varies from day to day, it still exhibits a general pattern over several days. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Day mA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Hour mA 6.1. Prediction Model We first evaluate the performance of the prediction model, which is judged by the amount of absolute error it made between the predicted and actual energy profile. Figure 5 shows the average error of each time slot in mA over the entire 72 days. Generally, the amount of error is larger during the day time because thats when the factor of weather can cause deviations in received energy, while the prediction made for night time is mostly correct. 6.2. Adaptive Duty cycling algorithm Prior methods to optimize performance while achieving energy neutral operation using harvested energy are scarce. Instead, we compare the performance of our algorithm against two extremes: the theoretical optimal calculated assuming complete knowledge about future energy availability and a simple approach which attempts to achieve energy neutrality using a fixed duty cycle without accounting for battery inefficiency. The optimal duty cycles are calculated for each slot using the future knowledge of actual received energy for that slot. For the simple approach, the duty cycle is kept constant within each day and is Figure 4 Solar Energy Profile (Left: Continuous, Right: Diurnal) Input: D: Initial duty cycle, X: Excess energy due to error in the prediction, P: Predicted energy profile, i: index of current time slot Output: D: Updated duty cycles in one or more subsequent slots AdaptDutyCycle() Iteration: At each time slot do: if X > 0 Wsorted = W{1, ...,Nw} sorted in decending order.

Figure 6 shows the results, using Dmax = 0.8 and Dmin = 0.3. The battery efficiency was varied from 0.5 to 1 on the x-axis and solar energy utilizations achieved by the three algorithms are shown on the y-axis. It shows the fraction of net received energy that is used to perform useful work rather than lost due to storage inefficiency. As can be seen from the figure, battery efficiency factor has great impact on the performance of the three different approaches. The three approaches all converges to 100% utilization if we have a perfect battery (η=1), that is, energy is not lost by storing it into the batteries. When battery inefficiency is taken into account, both the adaptive and optimal approach have much better solar energy utilization rate than the simple one.

CONCLUSIONS We discussed various issues in power management for systems powered using environmentally harvested energy. Specifically, we designed a method for optimizing performance subject to the constraint of energy neutral operation. We also derived a theoretically optimal bound on the performance and showed that our proposed algorithm operated very close to the optimal. The proposals were evaluated using real data collected using an energy harvesting sensor node deployed in an outdoor environment. Our method has significant advantages over currently used methods which are based on a conservative estimate of duty cycle and can only provide sub-optimal performance. However, this work is only the first step towards optimal solutions for energy neutral operation. It is designed for a specific power scaling method based on adapting the duty cycle. Several other power scaling methods, such as DVS, submodule power switching and the use of multiple low power modes are also available. It is thus of interest to extend our methods to exploit these advanced capabilities. 8.

En este artículo, presentamos un algoritmo de ciclismo de servicio adaptativo que permite que los nodos de sensores de recolección de energía ajusten de forma autónoma su ciclo de trabajo de acuerdo con la disponibilidad de energía en el medio ambiente. El algoritmo tiene tres objetivos, a saber, (a) alcanzar la operación neutral de energía, es decir, el consumo de energía no debe ser mayor que la energía proporcionada por el medio ambiente, (b) maximizar el rendimiento del sistema en función de un modelo de utilidad de aplicación sujeto a la restricción de energía de energía anterior, y (c) adaptándose a la dinámica de la fuente de energía en tiempo de ejecución. Presentamos un modelo que permite la cosecha de nodos de sensores para predecir oportunidades de energía futuras basadas en datos históricos. También derivamos un límite superior en el rendimiento máximo alcanzable suponiendo un conocimiento perfecto sobre el comportamiento futuro de la fuente de energía. Nuestros métodos se evalúan utilizando datos recopilados de una plataforma prototipo de recolección de energía solar y mostramos que nuestro algoritmo puede utilizar hasta un 58% más de energía ambiental en comparación con el caso cuando no se utiliza la gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha.

Introducción El suministro de energía siempre ha sido un problema crucial en el diseño de redes de sensores inalámbricos con baterías porque la vida útil y la utilidad de los sistemas están limitadas por cuánto tiempo las baterías pueden mantener la operación. La fidelidad de los datos producidos por una red de sensores comienza a degradarse una vez que los nodos del sensor comienzan a quedarse sin energía de la batería. Por lo tanto, la cosecha de energía del medio ambiente se ha propuesto para complementar o reemplazar por completo los suministros de batería para mejorar la vida útil del sistema y reducir el costo de mantenimiento de reemplazar las baterías periódicamente. Sin embargo, las métricas para evaluar los sistemas de recolección de energía son diferentes de las utilizadas para los sistemas alimentados por la batería. La energía ambiental es distinta de la energía de la batería de dos maneras. Primero, es un suministro inagotable que, si se usa adecuadamente, puede permitir que el sistema dure para siempre, a diferencia de la batería, que es un recurso limitado. En segundo lugar, existe una incertidumbre asociada con su disponibilidad y medición, en comparación con la energía almacenada en la batería que se puede conocer determinista. Por lo tanto, los métodos de administración de energía basados en el estado de la batería no siempre son aplicables a los sistemas de recolección de energía. Además, la mayoría de los esquemas de gestión de energía diseñados para sistemas con baterías solo representan la dinámica de los consumidores de energía (por ejemplo, CPU, radio) pero no de la dinámica del suministro de energía. En consecuencia, los sistemas alimentados por batería generalmente funcionan en el nivel de rendimiento más bajo que cumple con el requisito mínimo de fidelidad de datos para maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Los sistemas de recolección de energía, por otro lado, pueden proporcionar un rendimiento mejorado según la energía disponible. En este artículo, estudiaremos cómo adaptar el rendimiento del perfil de energía disponible. Existen muchas técnicas para lograr la escala de rendimiento en el nivel de nodo, como el ajuste de potencia de transmisión de radio [1], la escala de voltaje dinámico [2] y el uso de modos de baja potencia [3]. Sin embargo, estas técnicas requieren soporte de hardware y pueden no estar siempre disponibles en nodos sensores limitados por recursos. Alternativamente, una técnica de escala de rendimiento común es el ciclo de trabajo. Los dispositivos de baja potencia generalmente proporcionan al menos un modo de baja potencia en el que el nodo está apagado y el consumo de energía es insignificante. Además, la tasa del ciclo de trabajo está directamente relacionada con las métricas de rendimiento del sistema, como la latencia de la red y la frecuencia de muestreo. Utilizaremos el ajuste del ciclo de trabajo como la técnica de escala de rendimiento primitiva en nuestros algoritmos.2. La recolección de energía laboral relacionada se ha explorado para varios tipos diferentes de sistemas, como computadoras portátiles [4], [5], [6], redes de sensores [7], etc. Se han demostrado varias tecnologías para extraer energía del medio ambiente, incluidos los solares, basados en el movimiento, bioquímicos, basados en la vibración [8], [9], [10], [11] y otros se están desarrollando [12], [13] Si bien varias plataformas de nodo del sensor de recolección de energía se han prototipo [14], [15], [16], existe la necesidad de técnicas sistemáticas de gestión de energía que proporcionen garantías de rendimiento durante la operación del sistema. El primer trabajo en tener en cuenta la energía ambiental para el enrutamiento de datos fue [17], seguido de [18]. Si bien estos trabajos demostraron que las decisiones conscientes del entorno mejoran el rendimiento en comparación con las decisiones conscientes de la batería, su objetivo no era lograr la operación neutral de energía. Nuestras técnicas propuestas intentan maximizar el rendimiento del sistema mientras mantienen la operación de energía neutral.3. Modelo del sistema Las consideraciones de uso de energía en un sistema de cosecha varían significativamente de las de un sistema alimentado por batería, como se mencionó anteriormente. Proponemos el modelo que se muestra en la Figura 1 para diseñar métodos de gestión de energía en un sistema de cosecha. Las funciones de los diversos bloques que se muestran en la figura se analizan a continuación. Los métodos precisos utilizados en nuestro sistema para lograr estas funciones se discutirán en secciones posteriores. Seguimiento de energía cosechada: este bloque representa los mecanismos utilizados para medir la energía recibida del dispositivo de cosecha, como el panel solar. Dicha información es útil para determinar el perfil de disponibilidad de energía y la adaptación del rendimiento del sistema en función de él. La recopilación de esta información requiere que el hardware del nodo esté equipado con la instalación para medir la potencia generada desde el entorno, y la plataforma Heliomote [14] que utilizamos para evaluar los algoritmos tiene esta capacidad. Modelo de generación de energía: para nodos de sensores inalámbricos con capacidades limitadas de almacenamiento y procesamiento para poder usar los datos de energía cosechados, se requieren modelos que representan los componentes esenciales de esta información sin usar un almacenamiento extenso. El propósito de este bloque es proporcionar un modelo para la energía disponible para el sistema en una forma que puede usarse para tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Los datos medidos por el bloque de seguimiento de energía se utilizan aquí para predecir la disponibilidad de energía futura. Un buen modelo de predicción debe tener un bajo error de predicción y proporcionar valores de energía pronosticados para las duraciones lo suficiente como para tomar decisiones de escala de rendimiento significativas. Además, para las fuentes de energía que exhiben patrones a largo y a corto plazo (por ejemplo, variaciones diurnas y climáticas frente a patrones climáticos para la energía solar), el modelo debe poder capturar ambas características. Tal modelo también puede usar información de fuentes externas como el servicio de pronóstico del tiempo local para mejorar su precisión. Modelo de consumo de energía: también es importante tener información detallada sobre las características de uso de energía del sistema, en varios niveles de rendimiento. Para la aplicabilidad general de nuestro diseño, asumiremos que solo hay un modo de suspensión disponible. Suponemos que se conoce el consumo de energía en el sueño y los modos activos. Cabe señalar que para sistemas de baja potencia con capacidades más avanzadas, como la escala de voltaje dinámico (DV), múltiples modos de baja potencia y la capacidad de cerrar los componentes del sistema selectivamente, el consumo de energía en cada uno de los estados y el efecto resultante sobreEl rendimiento de la aplicación debe ser conocido por tomar decisiones de gestión de energía. Modelo de almacenamiento de energía: este bloque representa el modelo para la tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Dado que toda la energía generada puede no usarse instantáneamente, el sistema de cosecha generalmente tendrá algo de tecnología de almacenamiento de energía. Las tecnologías de almacenamiento (por ejemplo, baterías y ultraespacitores) son no ideales, ya que hay cierta pérdida de energía al almacenar y recuperar energía de ellas. Se debe saber que estas características administran eficientemente el uso y el almacenamiento de energía. Este bloque también incluye la capacidad del sistema para medir la energía almacenada residual. La mayoría de los sistemas de baja energía usan baterías para almacenar energía y proporcionar un estado de batería residual. Esto se basa comúnmente en la medición del voltaje de la batería que luego se asigna a la energía residual de la batería utilizando la relación de carga a voltaje conocida para la tecnología de la batería en uso. Los métodos más sofisticados que rastrean el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería también están disponibles. Gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha: las entradas proporcionadas por los bloques mencionados anteriormente se utilizan aquí para determinar la estrategia de gestión de energía adecuada para el sistema. La gestión de energía podría llevarse a cabo para cumplir diferentes objetivos en diferentes aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, en algunos sistemas, la energía cosechada puede complementar marginalmente el suministro de batería y el objetivo puede ser maximizar la vida útil del sistema. Un caso más interesante es cuando la energía cosechada se usa como la fuente principal de energía para el sistema con el objetivo de lograr una vida útil del sistema indefinidamente larga. En tales casos, el objetivo de gestión de energía es lograr la operación de energía neutral. En otras palabras, el sistema solo debe usar tanta energía como la cosecha del medio ambiente e intentar maximizar el rendimiento dentro de este presupuesto de energía disponible.4. Gestión de energía teóricamente óptima, desarrollamos la siguiente teoría para comprender el modo de operación neutral de energía. Definamos PS (T) como la energía cosechada del medio ambiente en el momento T, y la energía que la carga consume en ese momento es PC (T). Además, modelamos el búfer de almacenamiento no ideal mediante su eficiencia de ida y vuelta η (estrictamente menos de 1) y un plegamiento de potencia de fuga constante. Usando esta notación, la aplicación de la regla de conservación de energía conduce a la siguiente desigualdad: 0 0 00 [() ()] [() ()] 0 t t t t s c c s fuga t p t dt p t p t dt p dtb η + + −- - ≥+ −∫ ∫ ∫ (1) donde B0 es el nivel de batería inicial y la función [x]+ = x si x> 0 y cero de lo contrario. Función de definición 1 (ρ, σ1, σ2): se dice que una función no negativa, continua y limitada P (t) es una función (ρ, σ1, σ2) si y solo si es un valor de número real finito t,Se satisfacen los siguientes: 2 1 () T T P t dt tρ σ ρ σ− ≤ ≤ +∫ (2) Esta función puede usarse para modelar las fuentes de energía y las cargas. Si el perfil de energía cosechado PS (t) es una función (ρ1, σ1, σ2), entonces la tasa promedio de energía disponible durante largas duraciones se convierte en ρ1, y la ruptura está limitada por σ1 y σ2. Del mismo modo, la PC (t) se puede modelar como una función (ρ2, σ3), cuando ρ2 y σ3 se usan para colocar un límite superior en el consumo de energía (la desigualdad en el lado derecho) mientras que no hay restricciones mínimas de consumo de energía. La condición para la neutralidad de energía, la ecuación (1), conduce al siguiente teorema, en función de los modelos de producción de energía, consumo y tampón de energía discutidos anteriormente. Teorema 1 (Operación neutral de energía): considere un sistema de cosecha en el que el perfil de producción de energía se caracteriza por una función (ρ1, σ1, σ2), la carga se caracteriza por una función (ρ2, σ3) y el tampón de energía se caracteriza porParámetros η para eficiencia de almacenamiento y plávage para la potencia de fuga. Las siguientes condiciones son suficientes para que el sistema alcance la neutralidad de la energía: ρ2 ≤ ηρ1 - Plerea (3) B0 ≥ ησ2 + σ3 (4) B ≥ B0 (5) donde B0 es la energía inicial almacenada en el tampón y proporciona un límite inferior un límite inferior.Sobre la capacidad del tampón de energía B. La prueba se presenta en nuestro trabajo anterior [19]. Para ajustar el ciclo de trabajo D utilizando nuestro algoritmo de escala de rendimiento, asumimos la siguiente relación entre el ciclo de trabajo y la utilidad percibida del sistema al usuario: Suponga que la utilidad de la aplicación al usuario está representada por U (d) cuando el sistemaopera en un ciclo de trabajo D. entonces, min 1 min max 2 max () 0, (), (), u d si d d u d k d si d d d u d k si d d d β = <= + ≤ ≤ => Esto es bastante general yEl modelo simple y los valores específicos de Dmin y DMAX pueden determinarse según los requisitos de la aplicación. Como ejemplo, considere un nodo sensor diseñado para detectar la intrusión en una periferia. En este caso, un aumento lineal en el ciclo de trabajo se traduce en un aumento lineal en la probabilidad de detección. Se pueden conocer las velocidades más rápidas y más lentas de los intrusos, lo que lleva a un modelo de consumo de energía de seguimiento de energía mínimo y cosechado Modelo de almacenamiento de energía Harvestingare Mangement Modelo de generación de energía Carga de la Figura 1. Modelo del sistema para un sistema de recolección de energía.181 retraso de detección máxima tolerable, lo que da como resultado el DMAX y DMIN relevantes para el nodo del sensor. Si bien puede haber casos en los que la relación entre la utilidad y el ciclo de trabajo puede ser no lineal, en este documento, restringimos nuestro enfoque en aplicaciones que siguen este modelo lineal. En vista de los modelos anteriores para los componentes del sistema y el rendimiento requerido, el objetivo de nuestra estrategia de gestión de energía es ajustar el ciclo de trabajo d (i) dinámicamente para maximizar la utilidad total u (d) durante un período de tiempo, mientras queAsegurar la operación de energía neutral para el nodo del sensor. Antes de discutir los métodos de escala de rendimiento para recolectar la adaptación consciente del ciclo de trabajo, consideremos primero la estrategia óptima de gestión de energía que es posible para un perfil de generación de energía determinado. Para el cálculo de la estrategia óptima, asumimos el conocimiento completo del perfil de disponibilidad de energía en el nodo, incluida la disponibilidad en el futuro. El cálculo de lo óptimo es una herramienta útil para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo propuesto. Esto es particularmente útil para nuestro algoritmo, ya que no hay algoritmos anteriores disponibles para servir como línea de base para la comparación. Supongamos que el eje de tiempo se divide en ranuras discretas de duración Δt, y el cálculo de la adaptación del ciclo de trabajo se lleva a cabo sobre una ventana de las ranuras de tiempo de NW. Definimos las siguientes variables de perfil de energía, con el índice que varía sobre {1, ..., NW}: PS (i) es la potencia de salida de la fuente cosechada en la ranura de tiempo I, promediada durante la duración de la ranura, la PC es el consumo de energía.de la carga en modo activo, y d (i) es el ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura I, cuyo valor debe determinarse. B (i) es la energía de batería residual al comienzo de la ranura i. Después de esta convención, la energía de la batería se fue después de la última ranura en la ventana está representada por B (NW+1). Los valores de estas variables dependerán de la elección de D (i). La energía utilizada directamente de la fuente cosechada y la energía almacenada y utilizada de la batería debe tenerse en cuenta de manera diferente. La Figura 2 muestra dos casos posibles para PS (I) en una ranura de tiempo. PS (i) puede ser menor o superior a la PC, como se muestra en la izquierda y la derecha, respectivamente. Cuando PS (i) es más baja que la PC, parte de la energía utilizada por la carga proviene de la batería, mientras que cuando PS (i) es más alta que la PC, toda la energía utilizada se suministra directamente desde la fuente cosechada. El área cruzada muestra la energía que está disponible para el almacenamiento en la batería, mientras que el área de hashes muestra la energía extraída de la batería. Podemos escribir la energía utilizada desde la batería en cualquier ranura i como: () () () () [] () () {} () () [] 1 1c cs S sb i b i td i p p i tpI D I TD I P I Pη η + + - + = δ - - δ - - - - (6) En la ecuación (6), el primer término en el lado derecho mide la energía extraída de la batería cuando PS (i)<PC, el siguiente término mide la energía almacenada en la batería cuando el nodo está en modo de suspensión, y el último término mide la energía almacenada en la batería en modo activo si PS (i)> PC. Para el funcionamiento de la energía neutral, requerimos que la batería al final de la ventana de las ranuras NW sea mayor o igual a la batería inicial. Claramente, el nivel de la batería disminuirá cuando la energía cosechada no esté disponible y el sistema se opera desde la energía almacenada. Sin embargo, la ventana NW es elegida juiciosamente de tal manera que durante esa duración, esperamos que la disponibilidad de energía ambiental complete un ciclo periódico. Por ejemplo, en el caso de la recolección de energía solar, el NO podría elegirse para tener una duración de veinticuatro horas, correspondiente al ciclo diurno en la energía cosechada. Esta es una aproximación ya que una elección ideal del tamaño de la ventana sería infinita, pero se debe utilizar un tamaño finito para la tractabilidad analítica. Además, el nivel de la batería no puede ser negativo en ningún momento, y esto se garantiza al tener un nivel inicial de batería B0 lo suficientemente grande, de modo que la operación del nodo se mantiene incluso en el caso del apagón total durante un período de ventana. Dando que las restricciones anteriores cuantitativamente, podemos expresar el cálculo de los ciclos de servicio óptimos como un problema de optimización a continuación: 1 max () wn i d i = ∑ (7) () () () () () () {} (() () 1 1c s s s cb i b i td i p p i tp i d i td i p i pη η + + ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ - + = δ - - δ - - −⎣ ⎦ ⎣ ⎦ (8) 0 (1) B b = (9) 0 (1) wb n b+ ≥ (10) min w () i {1, ..., n} d i d≥ ∀ ∈ (11) max w () i {1, ..., N} d I d≤ ∀ ∈ (12) La solución al problema de optimización produce los ciclos de servicio que deben usarse en cada ranura y la evolución de la batería residual en el curso de las ranuras NW. Tenga en cuenta que mientras las restricciones anteriores contienen la función no lineal [x]+, las cantidades que ocurren dentro de esa función son constantes conocidas. Las cantidades variables ocurren solo en términos lineales y, por lo tanto, el problema de optimización anterior se puede resolver utilizando técnicas de programación lineal estándar, disponibles en las cajas de herramientas de optimización populares.5. La gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha ahora presentamos un algoritmo práctico para la gestión de energía que puede usarse para adaptar el rendimiento en función de la información de energía cosechada. Este algoritmo intenta lograr una operación neutral de energía sin utilizar el conocimiento de la disponibilidad de energía futura y maximiza el rendimiento alcanzable dentro de esa restricción. La estrategia de gestión de energía consciente de la cosecha consta de tres partes. La primera parte es una instanciación del modelo de generación de energía que rastrea los perfiles de entrada de energía pasados y los utiliza para predecir la disponibilidad de energía futura. La segunda parte calcula los ciclos de servicio óptimos basados en la energía predicha, y este paso utiliza nuestro método computacionalmente manejable para resolver el problema de optimización. La tercera parte consiste en un método para adaptar dinámicamente el ciclo de trabajo en respuesta al perfil de generación de energía observado en tiempo real. Se requiere este paso ya que la generación de energía observada puede desviarse significativamente de la disponibilidad de energía predicha y la operación de energía neutral de energía debe garantizarse con la energía real recibida en lugar de los valores predichos.5.1. Modelo de predicción de energía Utilizamos un modelo de predicción basado en el promedio móvil ponderado exponencialmente (EWMA). El método está diseñado para explotar el ciclo diurno en la energía solar, pero al mismo tiempo adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales. Se mantiene un resumen histórico del perfil de generación de energía para este propósito. Si bien el tamaño de los datos de almacenamiento se limita a una longitud vectorial de los valores de NW para minimizar los gastos generales de la memoria del algoritmo de administración de energía, el tamaño de la ventana es efectivamente infinito ya que cada valor en la ventana del historial depende de todos los datos observados hasta ese instante. El tamaño de la ventana se elige para ser 24 horas y cada ranura de tiempo se considera 30 minutos, ya que la variación en la potencia generada por el panel solar que usa esta configuración es inferior al 10% entre cada ranuras adyacentes. Esto produce NW = 48. Se pueden usar duraciones de ranura más pequeñas a expensas de un NW más alto. El resumen histórico mantenido se deriva de la siguiente manera. En un día típico, esperamos que la generación de energía sea similar a la generación de energía al mismo tiempo en los días anteriores. El valor de la energía generada en una ranura particular se mantiene como un promedio ponderado de la energía recibida en la misma ranura de tiempo durante todos los días observados. Los pesos son exponenciales, lo que resulta en una contribución en descomposición de la Figura 2 anterior. Dos posibles casos para cálculos de energía Slot I Slot K PC PC P (I) P (I) Datos de sueño activo 182. Más específicamente, el promedio histórico mantenido para cada ranura viene dado por: 1 (1) k k kx x xα α− = + - donde α es el valor del factor de ponderación, KX es el valor observado de energía generado en la ranura y1KX - es el promedio histórico previamente almacenado. En este modelo, la importancia de cada día en relación con el anterior permanece constante porque el mismo factor de ponderación se usó para todos los días. El valor promedio derivado de una ranura se trata como una estimación del valor de energía predicho para la ranura correspondiente al día posterior. Este método ayuda a los valores promedio históricos a adaptarse a las variaciones estacionales en la energía recibidas en diferentes días. Uno de los parámetros a elegir en el método de predicción anterior es el parámetro α, que es una medida de la tasa de cambio en el patrón de energía con el tiempo. Dado que este parámetro se ve afectado por las características de la ubicación de la energía y el nodo del sensor, el sistema debe tener un período de entrenamiento durante el cual se determinará este parámetro. Para determinar un buen valor de α, recopilamos datos de energía durante 72 días y comparamos el error promedio del método de predicción para varios valores de α. El error basado en los diferentes valores de α se muestra en la Figura 3. Esta curva sugiere un valor óptimo de α = 0.15 para un error de predicción mínimo y este valor se utilizará en el resto de este documento.5.2. Solución de baja complejidad Los valores de energía predichos para la siguiente ventana de las ranuras NW se utilizan para calcular los ciclos de servicio deseados para la siguiente ventana, suponiendo que los valores predichos coincidan con los valores observados en el futuro. Dado que nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un algoritmo práctico para los sistemas informáticos integrados, presentamos un método simplificado para resolver el problema de programación lineal presentado en la Sección 4. Para este fin, definimos los conjuntos S y D como sigue: {} {} |() 0 |() 0 S C C S S S I P I P D I P P I = - ≥ = -> Los dos conjuntos difieren por la condición de que si la operación del nodo se puede mantener completamente de la energía ambiental. En el caso de que la energía producida por el medio ambiente no sea suficiente, la batería se descargará para complementar la energía restante. A continuación, resumimos ambos lados de (6) sobre toda la ventana NW y la reescribimos con la nueva notación.1 1 1 1 () [()] () () () () ()] nw nw nw i i c s s s s c i i d i i s b b td i p p i tp i tp i d i td i p i pη η η+ = ∈ == ∈ - = δ - - δ + δ - δ −∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ El término en el lado izquierdo es en realidad la energía de la batería utilizada sobre toda la ventana de las ranuras NW, que se puede establecer en 0 para la operación neutral de energía. Después de alguna manipulación algebraica, esto produce: 1 1 () () () 1 () nw C S S C I I D I S P I D I P I P D I η η = ∈ ∈ ⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞ = + - + ⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠ ⎠ ⎝ ⎝ ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎝ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ eléctrico⎝ ⎠ ∑ ∑ ∑ (13) El término en el lado izquierdo es la energía total recibida en las ranuras NW. El primer término en el lado derecho se puede interpretar como la energía total consumida durante las ranuras D y el segundo término es la energía total consumida durante las ranuras S. Ahora podemos reemplazar tres restricciones (8), (9) y (10) en el problema original con (13), restableciendo el problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: 1 max () wn i d i = ∑ 1 1 () ()() 1 () nw c s s c i i d i s p p i d i p i p d i η η = ∈ ∈ ⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞ = + - + ⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠ ∑ ∑ ∑ min max d (i) d {1, ..., nw) d (i) d {1, ..., nw) I I ≥ ∀ ∈ ≤ ∀ ∈ Esta forma facilita una solución de baja complejidad que no requiere un solucionador de programación lineal general. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, es preferible establecer el ciclo de trabajo en DMIN para intervalos de tiempo donde la utilidad por unidad de energía es menos. Por otro lado, también nos gustaría las ranuras de tiempo con la PS más alta para operar en DMAX debido a una mejor eficiencia del uso de energía directamente de la fuente de energía. Combinando estas dos características, definimos la utilidad coeficiente para cada ranura I de la siguiente manera: 1 () 1 1 () 1 c c c c c c para i s w i p p i para i d η η ∈⎧ ⎪ = ⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞⎨ + +- ∈⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟⎪ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠⎩ ⎠⎩ ⎠⎩ ⎠⎩ ⎠⎩ ⎠⎩ donde w (i) es una representación de cuán eficiente es el uso de energía en una ranura de tiempo particular I.

En este caso, el diseñador del sistema es responsable de aumentar la disponibilidad de energía del medio ambiente (por ejemplo, mediante el uso de paneles solares más grandes). Si R es positivo, significa que el sistema tiene un exceso de energía que no se está utilizando, y esto puede asignarse para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo más allá de la Dmin para algunas ranuras. Dado que nuestro objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, la forma más eficiente de asignar el exceso de energía es asignar el ciclo de trabajo DMAX a las ranuras con la W (I) más alta. Por lo tanto, los coeficientes w (i) se organizan en orden decreciente y ciclo de trabajo que DMAX se asigna a las ranuras que comienzan con los coeficientes más grandes hasta que el exceso de energía disponible, R (calculado por (14) en cada iteración), es insuficiente para asignar DMAXa otra ranura. La energía restante, RLAST, se usa para aumentar el ciclo de trabajo a algún valor entre Dmin y DMAX en la ranura con el siguiente coeficiente más bajo.

Adaptación del ciclo de trabajo continuo de ranura por ranura. Los valores de energía observados pueden variar mucho de los predichos, como debido al efecto de las nubes u otros cambios repentinos. Por lo tanto, es importante adaptar los ciclos de servicio calculados utilizando los valores predichos, a las mediciones de energía reales en tiempo real para garantizar la neutralidad de la energía. Denota las asignaciones iniciales del ciclo de trabajo para cada ranura de tiempo que calculé usando los valores de energía predichos como d (i) = {1, ..., nw}. Primero calculamos la diferencia entre el nivel de potencia predicho PS (I) y el nivel de potencia real observado, PS (i) en cada ranura i. Luego, el exceso de energía en la ranura I, denotada por x, se puede obtener de la siguientei p x p i p i d i p i p i if p i p η -> ⎧ ⎪ = ⎨ - - - - - ≤⎪ ⎩ 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3 Alpha avgerrar (MA)Figura 3. Elección del parámetro de predicción.183 El término superior explica la diferencia de energía cuando la energía recibida real es más que la potencia extraída por la carga. Por otro lado, si la energía recibida es menor que la PC, tendremos que dar cuenta de la energía adicional utilizada de la batería por la carga, que es una función del ciclo de trabajo utilizado en la ranura de tiempo I y el factor de eficiencia de la batería η. Cuando se recibe más energía de lo previsto, X es positivo y ese exceso de energía está disponible para su uso en los solutos posteriores, mientras que si X es negativo, esa energía debe ser compensada desde las ranuras posteriores. Caso I: x <0. En este caso, queremos reducir los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en las ranuras futuras para compensar este déficit de energía. Dado que nuestra función objetivo es maximizar la utilidad total del sistema, tenemos que reducir los ciclos de trabajo para las ranuras de tiempo con el coeficiente de utilidad normalizado más pequeño, W (i). Esto se logra primero clasificando el coeficiente w (j), donde j> i.en orden decreciente, y luego reduciendo iterativamente DJ a Dmin hasta que la reducción total en el consumo de energía sea la misma que X. Caso II: x> 0. Aquí, queremos aumentar los ciclos de trabajo utilizados en el futuro para utilizar este exceso de energía que recibimos en la ranura de tiempo reciente. A diferencia del caso I, los ciclos de trabajo de las ranuras de tiempo futuras con el coeficiente de utilidad más alto W (I) deben aumentarse primero para maximizar la utilidad total del sistema. Supongamos que el ciclo de trabajo es cambiado por D en la ranura j.

Este cálculo se realiza al final de cada ranura para establecer el ciclo de trabajo para la próxima ranura. Afirmamos que nuestro algoritmo de ciclismo de trabajo es de energía neutral porque un excedente de energía en la ranura de tiempo anterior siempre se traducirá en oportunidades de energía adicionales para futuros intervalos de tiempo, y viceversa. El reclamo puede ser violado en casos de escasez severa de energía, especialmente hacia el final de la ventana. Por ejemplo, un gran déficit en el suministro de energía no se puede restaurar si no hay una entrada de energía futura hasta el final de la ventana. En tal caso, este desplazamiento se transferirá a la siguiente ventana para que aún se mantenga la neutralidad de energía a largo plazo.6. Evaluación Nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de servicio adaptativo se evaluó utilizando un perfil de energía solar real medido utilizando un nodo sensor llamado heliomote, capaz de cosechar energía solar [14]. Esta plataforma no solo rastrea la energía generada sino también el flujo de energía dentro y fuera de la batería para proporcionar una estimación precisa de la energía almacenada. La plataforma de recolección de energía se desplegó en una zona residencial en Los Ángeles desde principios de junio hasta mediados de agosto durante un total de 72 días. El nodo del sensor utilizado es una mota Mica2 que se ejecuta en un ciclo de trabajo fijo del 40% con una batería inicialmente completa. El voltaje de la batería y la corriente neta de los paneles solares se muestrean en un período de 10 segundos. El perfil de generación de energía para esa duración, medido por el seguimiento de la corriente de salida de la célula solar se muestra en la Figura 4, tanto en escalas continuas como diurnas. Podemos observar que, aunque el perfil de energía varía de día a día, todavía exhibe un patrón general durante varios días.0 10 20 30 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 30 40 50 60 70 Día MA 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 60 70 Hour MA 6.1. Modelo de predicción Primero evaluamos el rendimiento del modelo de predicción, que se juzga por la cantidad de error absoluto que cometió entre el perfil de energía predicho y real. La Figura 5 muestra el error promedio de cada ranura de tiempo en MA durante los 72 días completos. En general, la cantidad de error es mayor durante el día porque es cuando el factor del clima puede causar desviaciones en la energía recibida, mientras que la predicción realizada para la noche es principalmente correcta.6.2. Algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo Los métodos previos para optimizar el rendimiento al tiempo que logran la operación neutral de energía utilizando energía cosechada son escasos. En cambio, comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con dos extremos: la teórica óptima calculada suponiendo un conocimiento completo sobre la disponibilidad de energía futura y un enfoque simple que intenta lograr la neutralidad de energía utilizando un ciclo de trabajo fijo sin tener en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería. Los ciclos de servicio óptimos se calculan para cada ranura utilizando el conocimiento futuro de la energía recibida real para esa ranura. Para el enfoque simple, el ciclo de trabajo se mantiene constante dentro de cada día y es la Figura 4 Perfil de energía solar (izquierda: Continua, derecha: Diurnal) Entrada: D: Ciclo de trabajo inicial, X: Energía excesiva debido al error en la predicción, P: Perfil de energía predicho, I: índice de salida de ranura de tiempo actual: D: ciclos de servicio actualizados en una o más ranuras posteriores adaptDutyCycle () iteración: en cada ranura de tiempo do: if x> 0 wsorted = w {1, ...,,,, ...,NW} ordenado en orden de diezp.

La Figura 6 muestra los resultados, usando dmax = 0.8 y dmin = 0.3.

Muestra la fracción de energía recibida NET que se utiliza para realizar un trabajo útil en lugar de perder debido a la ineficiencia de almacenamiento. Como se puede ver en la figura, el factor de eficiencia de la batería tiene un gran impacto en el rendimiento de los tres enfoques diferentes. Los tres enfoques converge a la utilización del 100% si tenemos una batería perfecta (η = 1), es decir, la energía no se pierde al almacenarla en las baterías. Cuando se tiene en cuenta la ineficiencia de la batería, tanto el enfoque adaptativo como el óptimo tienen una tasa de utilización de energía solar mucho mejor que la simple. Además, el resultado también muestra que nuestro algoritmo de ciclo de trabajo adaptativo funciona muy cerca de lo óptimo.0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 EtA-Batery Batery Rondlip Eficiencia SolarEnergyutilización (%) Simple Simple también comparamos el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo con diferentes valores de Dmin y Dmax para η = 0.7, que es típico deNimh baterías.

Conclusiones Discutimos varios temas en la gestión de energía para los sistemas alimentados con energía cosechada ambientalmente. Específicamente, diseñamos un método para optimizar el rendimiento sujeto a la restricción de la operación de energía neutral. También derivamos un límite teóricamente óptimo en el rendimiento y mostramos que nuestro algoritmo propuesto funcionaba muy cerca de lo óptimo. Las propuestas se evaluaron utilizando datos reales recopilados utilizando un nodo sensor de recolección de energía desplegado en un entorno al aire libre. Nuestro método tiene ventajas significativas sobre los métodos utilizados actualmente que se basan en una estimación conservadora del ciclo de trabajo y solo pueden proporcionar un rendimiento subóptimo. Sin embargo, este trabajo es solo el primer paso hacia soluciones óptimas para la operación neutral de energía. Está diseñado para un método específico de escala de potencia basado en adaptar el ciclo de trabajo. También están disponibles varios otros métodos de escala de potencia, como DVS, conmutación de alimentación de submódulos y el uso de múltiples modos de baja potencia. Por lo tanto, es interesante extender nuestros métodos para explotar estas capacidades avanzadas.8.

        "For the calculation of the optimal strategy, we assume complete knowledge of the energy availability profile at the node, including the availability in the future.",
        "The calculation of the optimal is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of our proposed algorithm.",
        "This is particularly useful for our algorithm since no prior algorithms are available to serve as a baseline for comparison.",
        "Suppose the time axis is partitioned into discrete slots of duration ΔT, and the duty cycle adaptation calculation is carried out over a window of Nw such time slots.",
        "We define the following energy profile variables, with the index i ranging over {1,…, Nw}: Ps(i) is the power output from the harvested source in time slot i, averaged over the slot duration, Pc is the power consumption of the load in active mode, and D(i) is the duty cycle used in slot i, whose value is to be determined.",
        "B(i) is the residual battery energy at the beginning of slot i.",
        "Following this convention, the battery energy left after the last slot in the window is represented by B(Nw+1).",
        "The values of these variables will depend on the choice of D(i).",
        "The energy used directly from the harvested source and the energy stored and used from the battery must be accounted for differently.",
        "Figure 2 shows two possible cases for Ps(i) in a time slot.",
        "Ps(i) may either be less than or higher than Pc , as shown on the left and right respectively.",
        "When Ps(i) is lower than Pc, some of the energy used by the load comes from the battery, while when Ps(i) is higher than Pc, all the energy used is supplied directly from the harvested source.",
        "The crosshatched area shows the energy that is available for storage into the battery while the hashed area shows the energy drawn from the battery.",

        "For energy neutral operation, we require the battery at the end of the window of Nw slots to be greater than or equal to the starting battery.",
        "Clearly, battery level will go down when the harvested energy is not available and the system is operated from stored energy.",
        "However, the window Nw is judiciously chosen such that over that duration, we expect the environmental energy availability to complete a periodic cycle.",
        "For instance, in the case of solar energy harvesting, Nw could be chosen to be a twenty-four hour duration, corresponding to the diurnal cycle in the harvested energy.",
        "This is an approximation since an ideal choice of the window size would be infinite, but a finite size must be used for analytical tractability.",
        "Further, the battery level cannot be negative at any time, and this is ensured by having a large enough initial battery level B0 such that node operation is sustained even in the case of total blackout during a window period.",
        "Stating the above constraints quantitatively, we can express the calculation of the optimal duty cycles as an optimization problem below: 1 max ( ) wN i D i = ∑ (7) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ){ } ( ) ( )1 1c s s s cB i B i TD i P P i TP i D i TD i P i Pη η + + ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤− + = Δ − − Δ − − −⎣ ⎦ ⎣ ⎦ (8) 0(1)B B= (9) 0( 1)wB N B+ ≥ (10) min w( ) i {1,...,N }D i D≥ ∀ ∈ (11) max w( ) i {1,...,N }D i D≤ ∀ ∈ (12) The solution to the optimization problem yields the duty cycles that must be used in every slot and the evolution of residual battery over the course of Nw slots.",
        "Note that while the constraints above contain the non-linear function [x]+ , the quantities occurring within that function are all known constants.",
        "The variable quantities occur only in linear terms and hence the above optimization problem can be solved using standard linear programming techniques, available in popular optimization toolboxes. 5.",
        "HARVESTING-AWARE POWER MANAGEMENT We now present a practical algorithm for power management that may be used for adapting the performance based on harvested energy information.",
        "This algorithm attempts to achieve energy neutral operation without using knowledge of the future energy availability and maximizes the achievable performance within that constraint.",
        "The harvesting-aware power management strategy consists of three parts.",
        "The first part is an instantiation of the energy generation model which tracks past energy input profiles and uses them to predict future energy availability.",
        "The second part computes the optimal duty cycles based on the predicted energy, and this step uses our computationally tractable method to solve the optimization problem.",
        "The third part consists of a method to dynamically adapt the duty cycle in response to the observed energy generation profile in real time.",
        "This step is required since the observed energy generation may deviate significantly from the predicted energy availability and energy neutral operation must be ensured with the actual energy received rather than the predicted values. 5.1.",
        "Energy Prediction Model We use a prediction model based on Exponentially Weighted Moving-Average (EWMA).",
        "The method is designed to exploit the diurnal cycle in solar energy but at the same time adapt to the seasonal variations.",
        "A historical summary of the energy generation profile is maintained for this purpose.",
        "While the storage data size is limited to a vector length of Nw values in order to minimize the memory overheads of the power management algorithm, the window size is effectively infinite as each value in the history window depends on all the observed data up to that instant.",
        "The window size is chosen to be 24 hours and each time slot is taken to be 30 minutes as the variation in generated power by the solar panel using this setting is less than 10% between each adjacent slots.",
        "This yields Nw = 48.",
        "Smaller slot durations may be used at the expense of a higher Nw.",
        "The historical summary maintained is derived as follows.",
        "On a typical day, we expect the energy generation to be similar to the energy generation at the same time on the previous days.",
        "The value of energy generated in a particular slot is maintained as a weighted average of the energy received in the same time-slot during all observed days.",

        "Two possible cases for energy calculations Slot i Slot k Pc Pc P(i) P(i) Active Sleep 182 data.",
        "More specifically, the historical average maintained for each slot is given by: 1 (1 )k k kx x xα α−= + − where α is the value of the weighting factor, kx is the observed value of energy generated in the slot, and 1kx − is the previously stored historical average.",
        "In this model, the importance of each day relative to the previous one remains constant because the same weighting factor was used for all days.",
        "The average value derived for a slot is treated as an estimate of predicted energy value for the slot corresponding to the subsequent day.",
        "This method helps the historical average values adapt to the seasonal variations in energy received on different days.",
        "One of the parameters to be chosen in the above prediction method is the parameter α, which is a measure of rate of shift in energy pattern over time.",
        "Since this parameter is affected by the characteristics of the energy and sensor node location, the system should have a training period during which this parameter will be determined.",
        "To determine a good value of α, we collected energy data over 72 days and compared the average error of the prediction method for various values of α.",
        "The error based on the different values of α is shown in Figure 3.",
        "This curve suggests an optimum value of α = 0.15 for minimum prediction error and this value will be used in the remainder of this paper. 5.2.",
        "Low-complexity Solution The energy values predicted for the next window of Nw slots are used to calculated the desired duty cycles for the next window, assuming the predicted values match the observed values in the future.",
        "Since our objective is to develop a practical algorithm for embedded computing systems, we present a simplified method to solve the linear programming problem presented in Section 4.",
