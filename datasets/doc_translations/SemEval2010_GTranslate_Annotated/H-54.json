INTRODUCTION Biologists search for literature on a daily basis. For most biologists, PubMed, an online service of U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM), is the most commonly used tool for searching the biomedical literature. PubMed allows for keyword search by using Boolean operators. For example, if one desires documents on the use of the drug propanolol in the disease hypertension, a typical PubMed query might be propanolol AND hypertension, which will return all the documents having the two keywords. Keyword search in PubMed is effective if the query is well-crafted by the users using their expertise. However, information needs of biologists, in some cases, are expressed as complex questions [8][9], which PubMed is not designed to handle. While NLM does maintain an experimental tool for free-text queries [6], it is still based on PubMed keyword search. The Genomics track of the 2006 Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) provides a common platform to assess the methods and techniques proposed by various groups for biomedical information retrieval. The queries were collected from real biologists and they are expressed as complex questions, such as How do mutations in the Huntingtin gene affect Huntingtons disease?. The document collection contains 162,259 Highwire full-text documents in HTML format. Systems from participating groups are expected to find relevant passages within the full-text documents. A passage is defined as any span of text that does not include the HTML paragraph tag (i.e., <P> or </P>). We approached the problem by utilizing domain-specific knowledge in a conceptual retrieval model. Domain-specific knowledge, in this paper, refers to information about concepts and relationships between concepts in a certain domain. We assume that appropriate use of domain-specific knowledge might improve the effectiveness of retrieval. For example, given a query What is the role of gene PRNP in the Mad Cow Disease?, expanding the gene symbol PRNP with its synonyms Prp, PrPSc, and prion protein, more relevant documents might be retrieved. PubMed and many other biomedical systems [8][9][10][13] also make use of domain-specific knowledge to improve retrieval effectiveness. Intuitively, retrieval on the level of concepts should outperform bag-of-words approaches, since the semantic relationships among words in a concept are utilized. In some recent studies [13][15], positive results have been reported for this hypothesis. In this paper, concepts are entry terms of the ontology Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), a controlled vocabulary maintained by NLM for indexing biomedical literature, or gene symbols in the Entrez gene database also from NLM. A concept could be a word, such as the gene symbol PRNP, or a phrase, such as Mad cow diseases. In the conceptual retrieval model presented in this paper, the similarity between a query and a document is measured on both concept and word levels. This paper makes two contributions: 1. We propose a conceptual approach to utilize domain-specific knowledge in an IR system to improve its effectiveness in retrieving biomedical literature. Based on this approach, our system achieved significant improvement (23%) over the best reported result in passage retrieval in the Genomics track of TREC 2006. 2. We examine the effects of utilizing concepts and of different types of domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution. This paper is organized as follows: problem statement is given in the next section. The techniques are introduced in section 3. In section 4, we present the experimental results. Related works are given in section 5 and finally, we conclude the paper in section 6. 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT We describe the queries, document collection and the system output in this section. The query set used in the Genomics track of TREC 2006 consists of 28 questions collected from real biologists. As described in [8], these questions all have the following general format: Biological object (1..m) Relationship ←⎯⎯⎯⎯→ Biological process (1..n) (1) where a biological object might be a gene, protein, or gene mutation and a biological process can be a physiological process or disease. A question might involve multiple biological objects (m) and multiple biological processes (n). These questions were derived from four templates (Table 2). Table 2 Query templates and examples in the Genomics track of TREC 2006 Template Example What is the role of gene in disease? What is the role of DRD4 in alcoholism? What effect does gene have on biological process? What effect does the insulin receptor gene have on tumorigenesis? How do genes interact in organ function? How do HMG and HMGB1 interact in hepatitis? How does a mutation in gene influence biological process? How does a mutation in Ret influence thyroid function? Features of the queries: 1) They are different from the typical Web queries and the PubMed queries, both of which usually consist of 1 to 3 keywords; 2) They are generated from structural templates which can be used by a system to identify the query components, the biological object or process. The document collection contains 162,259 Highwire full-text documents in HTML format. The output of the system is a list of passages ranked according to their similarities with the query. A passage is defined as any span of text that does not include the HTML paragraph tag (i.e., <P> or </P>). A passage could be a part of a sentence, a sentence, a set of consecutive sentences or a paragraph (i.e., the whole span of text that are inside of <P> and </P> HTML tags). This is a passage-level information retrieval problem with the attempt to put biologists in contexts where relevant information is provided. 3. TECHNIQUES AND METHODS We approached the problem by first retrieving the top-k most relevant paragraphs, then extracting passages from these paragraphs, and finally ranking the passages. In this process, we employed several techniques and methods, which will be introduced in this section. First, we give two definitions: Definition 3.1 A concept is 1) a entry term in the MeSH ontology, or 2) a gene symbol in the Entrez gene database. This definition of concept can be generalized to include other biomedical dictionary terms. Definition 3.2 A semantic type is a category defined in the Semantic Network of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) [14]. The current release of the UMLS Semantic Network contains 135 semantic types such as Disease or Syndrome. Each entry term in the MeSH ontology is assigned one or more semantic types. Each gene symbol in the Entrez gene database maps to the semantic type Gene or Genome. In addition, these semantic types are linked by 54 relationships. For example, Antibiotic prevents Disease or Syndrome. These relationships among semantic types represent general biomedical knowledge. We utilized these semantic types and their relationships to identify related concepts. The rest of this section is organized as follows: in section 3.1, we explain how the concepts are identified within a query. In section 3.2, we specify five different types of domain-specific knowledge and introduce how they are compiled. In section 3.3, we present our conceptual IR model. Finally, our strategy for passage extraction is described in section 3.4. 3.1 Identifying concepts within a query A concept, defined in Definition 3.1, is a gene symbol or a MeSH term. We make use of the query templates to identify gene symbols. For example, the query How do HMG and HMGB1 interact in hepatitis? is derived from the template How do genes interact in organ function?. In this case, HMG and HMGB1 will be identified as gene symbols. In cases where the query templates are not provided, programs for recognition of gene symbols within texts are needed. We use the query translation functionality of PubMed to extract MeSH terms in a query. This is done by submitting the whole query to PubMed, which will then return a file in which the MeSH terms in the query are labeled. In Table 3.1, three MeSH terms within the query What is the role of gene PRNP in the Mad cow disease? are found in the PubMed translation: encephalopathy, bovine spongiform for Mad cow disease, genes for gene, and role for role. Table 3.1 The PubMed translation of the query What is the role of gene PRNP in the Mad cow disease?. Term PubMed translation Mad cow disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy[Text Word] OR encephalopathy, bovine spongiform[MeSH Terms] OR Mad cow disease[Text Word] gene (genes[TIAB] NOT Medline[SB]) OR genes[MeSH Terms] OR gene[Text Word] role role[MeSH Terms] OR role[Text Word] 3.2 Compiling domain-specific knowledge In this paper, domain-specific knowledge refers to information about concepts and their relationships in a certain domain. We used five types of domain-specific knowledge in the domain of genomics: Type 1. Synonyms (terms listed in the thesauruses that refer to the same meaning) Type 2. Hypernyms (more generic terms, one level only) Type 3. Hyponyms (more specific terms, one level only) Type 4. Lexical variants (different forms of the same concept, such as abbreviations. They are commonly used in the literature, but might not be listed in the thesauruses) Type 5. Implicitly related concepts (terms that are semantically related and also co-occur more frequently than being independent in the biomedical texts) Knowledge of type 1-3 is retrieved from the following two thesauruses: 1) MeSH, a controlled vocabulary maintained by NLM for indexing biomedical literature. The 2007 version of MeSH contains information about 190,000 concepts. These concepts are organized in a tree hierarchy; 2) Entrez Gene, one of the most widely used searchable databases of genes. The current version of Entrez Gene contains information about 1.7 million genes. It does not have a hierarchy. Only synonyms are retrieved from Entrez Gene. The compiling of type 4-5 knowledge is introduced in section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, respectively. 3.2.1 Lexical variants Lexical variants of gene symbols New gene symbols and their lexical variants are regularly introduced into the biomedical literature [7]. However, many reference databases, such as UMLS and Entrez Gene, may not be able to keep track of all this kind of variants. For example, for the gene symbol NF-kappa B, at least 5 different lexical variants can be found in the biomedical literature: NF-kappaB, NFkappaB, NFkappa B, NF-kB, and NFkB, three of which are not in the current UMLS and two not in the Entrez Gene. [3][21] have shown that expanding gene symbols with their lexical variants improved the retrieval effectiveness of their biomedical IR systems. In our system, we employed the following two strategies to retrieve lexical variants of gene symbols. Strategy I: This strategy is to automatically generate lexical variants according to a set of manually crafted heuristics [3][21]. For example, given a gene symbol PLA2, a variant PLAII is generated according to the heuristic that Roman numerals and Arabic numerals are convertible when naming gene symbols. Another variant, PLA 2, is also generated since a hyphen or a space could be inserted at the transition between alphabetic and numerical characters in a gene symbol. Strategy II: This strategy is to retrieve lexical variants from an abbreviation database. ADAM [22] is an abbreviation database which covers frequently used abbreviations and their definitions (or long-forms) within MEDLINE, the authoritative repository of citations from the biomedical literature maintained by the NLM. Given a query How does nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NM23) contribute to tumor progression?, we first identify the abbreviation NM23 and its long-form nucleoside diphosphate kinase using the abbreviation identification program from [4]. Searching the long-form nucleoside diphosphate kinase in ADAM, other abbreviations, such as NDPK or NDK, are retrieved. These abbreviations are considered as the lexical variants of NM23. Lexical variants of MeSH concepts ADAM is used to obtain the lexical variants of MeSH concepts as well. All the abbreviations of a MeSH concept in ADAM are considered as lexical variants to each other. In addition, those long-forms that share the same abbreviation with the MeSH concept and are different by an edit distance of 1 or 2 are also considered as its lexical variants. As an example, human papilloma viruses and human papillomaviruses have the same abbreviation HPV in ADAM and their edit distance is 1. Thus they are considered as lexical variants to each other. The edit distance between two strings is measured by the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions of a single character required to transform one string into the other [12]. 3.2.2 Implicitly related concepts Motivation: In some cases, there are few documents in the literature that directly answer a given query. In this situation, those documents that implicitly answer their questions or provide supporting information would be very helpful. For example, there are few documents in PubMed that directly answer the query What is the role of the genes HNF4 and COUP-tf I in the suppression in the function of the liver?. However, there exist some documents about the role of HNF4 and COUP-tf I in regulating hepatitis B virus transcription. It is very likely that the biologists would be interested in these documents because hepatitis B virus is known as a virus that could cause serious damage to the function of liver. In the given example, hepatitis B virus is not a synonym, hypernym, hyponym, nor a lexical variant of any of the query concepts, but it is semantically related to the query concepts according to the UMLS Semantic Network. We call this type of concepts implicitly related concepts of the query. This notion is similar to the B-term used in [19] for relating two disjoint literatures for biomedical hypothesis generation. The difference is that we utilize the semantic relationships among query concepts to exclusively focus on concepts of certain semantic types. A query q in format (1) of section 2 can be represented by q = (A, C) where A is the set of biological objects and C is the set of biological processes. Those concepts that are semantically related to both A and C according to the UMLS Semantic Network are considered as the implicitly related concepts of the query. In the above example, A = {HNF4, COUP-tf I}, C = {function of liver}, and hepatitis B virus is one of the implicitly related concepts. We make use of the MEDLINE database to extract the implicitly related concepts. The 2006 version of MEDLINE database contains citations (i.e., abstracts, titles, and etc.) of over 15 million biomedical articles. Each document in MEDLINE is manually indexed by a list of MeSH terms to describe the topics covered by that document. Implicitly related concepts are extracted and ranked in the following steps: Step 1. Let list_A be the set of MeSH terms that are 1) used for indexing those MEDLINE citations having A, and 2) semantically related to A according to the UMLS Semantic Network. Similarly, list_C is created for C. Concepts in B = list_A ∩ list_C are considered as implicitly related concepts of the query. Step 2. For each concept b∈B, compute the association between b and A using the mutual information measure [5]: P( , ) ( , ) log P( )P( ) b A I b A b A = where P(x) = n/N, n is the number of MEDLINE citations having x and N is the size of MEDLINE. A large value for I(b, A) means that b and A co-occur much more often than being independent. I(b, C) is computed similarly. Step 3. Let r(b) = (I(b, A), I(b, C)), for b∈ B. Given b1, b2 ∈ B, we say r(b1) ≤ r(b2) if I(b1, A) ≤ I(b2, A) and I(b1, C) ≤ I(b2, C). Then the association between b and the query q is measured by: { : and ( ) ( )} ( , ) { : and ( ) ( )} x x B r x r b score b q x x B r b r x ∈ ≤ = ∈ ≤ (2) The numerator in Formula 2 is the number of the concepts in B that are associated with both A and C equally with or less than b. The denominator is the number of the concepts in B that are associated with both A and C equally with or more than b. Figure 3.2.2 shows the top 4 implicitly related concepts for the sample query. Figure 3.2.2 Top 4 implicitly related concepts for the query How do interactions between HNF4 and COUP-TF1 suppress liver function?. In Figure 3.2.2, the top 4 implicitly related concepts are all highly associated with liver: Hepatocytes are liver cells; Hepatoblastoma is a malignant liver neoplasm occurring in young children; the vast majority of Gluconeogenesis takes place in the liver; and Hepatitis B virus is a virus that could cause serious damage to the function of liver. The top-k ranked concepts in B are used for query expansion: if I(b, A) ≥ I(b, C), then b is considered as an implicit related concept of A. A document having b but not A will receive a partial weight of A. The expansion is similar for C when I(b, A) < I(b, C). 3.3 Conceptual IR model We now discuss our conceptual IR model. We first give the basic conceptual IR model in section 3.3.1. Then we explain how the domain-specific knowledge is incorporated in the model using query expansion in section 3.3.2. A pseudo-feedback strategy is introduced in section 3.3.3. In section 3.3.4, we give a strategy to improve the ranking by avoiding incorrect match of abbreviations. 3.3.1 Basic model Given a query q and a document d, our model measures two similarities, concept similarity and word similarity: ( , ) ( , )( , ) ( , ) concept word sim q d sim q d sim q d= Concept similarity Two vectors are derived from a query q, 1 2 1 11 12 1 2 21 22 2 ( , ) ( , ,..., ) ( , ,..., ) m n q v v v c c c v c c c = = = where v1 is a vector of concepts describing the biological object(s) and v2 is a vector of concepts describing the biological process(es). Given a vector of concepts v, let s(v) be the set of concepts in v. The weight of vi is then measured by: ( ) max{log : ( ) ( ) and 0}i i v v N w v s v s v n n = ⊆ > where v is a vector that contains a subset of concepts in vi and nv is the number of documents having all the concepts in v. The concept similarity between q and d is then computed by 2 1 ( )( , ) i i concept i w vsim q d α = = ×∑ where αi is a parameter to indicate the completeness of vi that document d has covered. αi is measured by: and i i i c c d c v c c v idf idf α ∈ ∈ ∈ = ∑ ∑ (3) where idfc is the inverse document frequency of concept c. An example: suppose we have a query How does Nurr-77 delete T cells before they migrate to the spleen or lymph nodes and how does this impact autoimmunity?. After identifying the concepts in the query, we have: 1 2 (Nurr-77) (T cells, spleen, autoimmunity, lymph nodes) v v = = Suppose that some document frequencies of different combinations of concepts are as follows: 25 df(Nurr-77) 0 df(T cells, spleen, autoimmunity, lymph nodes) 326 df(T cells, spleen, autoimmunity) 82 df(spleen, autoimmunity, lymph nodes) 147 df(T cells, autoimmunity, lymph nodes) 2332 df(T cells, spleen, lymph nodes) The weight of vi is then computed by (note that there does not exist a document having all the concepts in v2): 1 2 ( ) log( / 25) ( ) log( /82) w v N w v N = = . Now suppose a document d contains concepts Nurr-77, T cells, spleen, and lymph nodes, but not autoimmunity, then the value of parameter αi is computed as follows: 1 2 1 (T cells)+ (spleen)+ (lymph nodes) (T cells)+ (spleen)+ (lymph nodes)+ (autoimmunity) idf idf idf idf idf idf idf α α = = Word similarity The similarity between q and d on the word level is computed using Okapi [17]: 10.5 ( 1) log( )( , ) 0.5word w q N n k tf sim q d n K tf∈ − + + = + + ∑ (4) where N is the size of the document collection; n is the number of documents containing w; K=k1 × ((1-b)+b × dl/avdl) and k1=1.2, C Function of Liver Implicitly related concepts (B) Hepatocytes Hepatoblastoma Gluconeogenesis Hepatitis B virus HNF4 and COUP-tf I A b=0.75 are constants. dl is the document length of d and avdl is the average document length; tf is the term frequency of w within d. The model Given two documents d1 and d2, we say 1 2( , ) ( , )sim q d sim q d> or d1 will be ranked higher than d2, with respect to the same query q, if either 1) 1 2( , ) ( , ) concept concept sim q d sim q d> or 2) 1 2 1 2and( , ) ( , ) ( , ) ( , ) concept concept word word sim q d sim q d sim q d sim q d= > This conceptual IR model emphasizes the similarity on the concept level. A similar model but applied to non-biomedical domain has been given in [15]. 3.3.2 Incorporating domain-specific knowledge Given a concept c, a vector u is derived by incorporating its domain-specific knowledge: 1 2 3( , , , )u c u u u= where u1 is a vector of its synonyms, hyponyms, and lexical variants; u2 is a vector of its hypernyms; and u3 is a vector of its implicitly related concepts. An occurrence of any term in u1 will be counted as an occurrence of c. idfc in Formula 3 is updated as: 1, logc c u N D idf = 1,c uD is the set of documents having c or any term in 1u . The weight that a document d receives from u is given by: max{ : and }tw t u t d∈ ∈ where wt = β .cidf× The weighting factor β is an empirical tuning parameter determined as: 1. β = 1 if t is the original concept, its synonym, its hyponym, or its lexical variant; 2. β = 0.95 if t is a hypernym; 3. β = 0.90× (k-i+1)/k if t is an implicitly related concept. k is the number of selected top ranked implicitly related concepts (see section 3.2.2); i is the position of t in the ranking of implicitly related concepts. 3.3.3 Pseudo-feedback Pseudo-feedback is a technique commonly used to improve retrieval performance by adding new terms into the original query. We used a modified pseudo-feedback strategy described in [2]. Step 1. Let C be the set of concepts in the top 15 ranked documents. For each concept c in C, compute the similarity between c and the query q, the computation of sim(q,c) can be found in [2]. Step 2. The top-k ranked concepts by sim(q,c) are selected. Step 3. Associate each selected concept c with the concept cq in q that 1) has the same semantic type as c, and 2) is most related to c among all the concepts in q. The association between c and cq is computed by: P( , ) ( , ) log P( )P( ) q q q c c I c c c c = where P(x) = n/N, n is the number of documents having x and N is the size of the document collection. A document having c but not cq receives a weight given by: (0.5× (k-i+1)/k) ,qcidf× where i is the position of c in the ranking of step 2. 3.3.4 Avoid incorrect match of abbreviations Some gene symbols are very short and thus ambiguous. For example, the gene symbol APC could be the abbreviation for many non-gene long-forms, such as air pollution control, aerobic plate count, or argon plasma coagulation. This step is to avoid incorrect match of abbreviations in the top ranked documents. Given an abbreviation X with the long-form L in the query, we scan the top-k ranked (k=1000) documents and when a document is found with X, we compare L with all the long-forms of X in that document. If none of these long-forms is equal or close to L (i.e., the edit distance between L and the long-form of X in that document is 1 or 2), then the concept similarity of X is subtracted. 3.4 Passage extraction The goal of passage extraction is to highlight the most relevant fragments of text in paragraphs. A passage is defined as any span of text that does not include the HTML paragraph tag (i.e., <P> or </P>). A passage could be a part of a sentence, a sentence, a set of consecutive sentences or a paragraph (i.e., the whole span of text that are inside of <P> and </P> HTML tags). It is also possible to have more than one relevant passage in a single paragraph. Our strategy for passage extraction assumes that the optimal passage(s) in a paragraph should have all the query concepts that the whole paragraph has. Also they should have higher density of query concepts than other fragments of text in the paragraph. Suppose we have a query q and a paragraph p represented by a sequence of sentences 1 2... .np s s s= Let C be the set of concepts in q that occur in p and S = Φ. Step 1. For each sequence of consecutive sentences 1... ,i i js s s+ 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, let S = S 1{ ... }i i js s s+∪ if 1...i i js s s+ satisfies that: 1) Every query concept in C occurs in 1...i i js s s+ and 2) There does not exist k, such that i < k < j and every query concept in C occurs in 1...i i ks s s+ or 1 2... .k k js s s+ + Condition 1 requires 1...i i js s s+ having all the query concepts in p and condition 2 requires 1...i i js s s+ be the minimal. Step 2. Let 1min{ 1: ... }i i jL j i s s s S+= − + ∈ . For every 1...i i js s s+ in S, let 1{ ... }i i jS S s s s+= − if (j - i + 1) > L. This step is to remove those sequences of sentences in S that have lower density of query concepts. Step 3. For every two sequences of consecutive sentences 1 1 1 2 2 21 1... , and ...i i j i i js s s S s s s S+ +∈ ∈ , if 1 2 1 2 2 1 , and 1 i i j j i j ≤ ≤ ≤ + (5) then do Repeat this step until for every two sequences of consecutive sentences in S, condition (5) does not apply. This step is to merge those sequences of sentences in S that are adjacent or overlapped. Finally the remaining sequences of sentences in S are returned as the optimal passages in the paragraph p with respect to the query. 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 { ... } { ... } { ... } i i j i i j i i j S S s s s S S s s s S S s s s + + + = ∪ = − = − 4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The evaluation of our techniques and the experimental results are given in this section. We first describe the datasets and evaluation metrics used in our experiments and then present the results. 4.1 Data sets and evaluation metrics Our experiments were performed on the platform of the Genomics track of TREC 2006. The document collection contains 162,259 full-text documents from 49 Highwire biomedical journals. The set of queries consists of 28 queries collected from real biologists. The performance is measured on three different levels (passage, aspect, and document) to provide better insight on how the question is answered from different perspectives. Passage MAP: As described in [8], this is a character-based precision calculated as follows: At each relevant retrieved passage, precision will be computed as the fraction of characters overlapping with the gold standard passages divided by the total number of characters included in all nominated passages from this system for the topic up until that point. Similar to regular MAP, relevant passages that were not retrieved will be added into the calculation as well, with precision set to 0 for relevant passages not retrieved. Then the mean of these average precisions over all topics will be calculated to compute the mean average passage precision. Aspect MAP: A question could be addressed from different aspects. For example, the question what is the role of gene PRNP in the Mad cow disease? could be answered from aspects like Diagnosis, Neurologic manifestations, or Prions/Genetics. This measure indicates how comprehensive the question is answered. Document MAP: This is the standard IR measure. The precision is measured at every point where a relevant document is obtained and then averaged over all relevant documents to obtain the average precision for a given query. For a set of queries, the mean of the average precision for all queries is the MAP of that IR system. The output of the system is a list of passages ranked according to their similarities with the query. The performances on the three levels are then calculated based on the ranking of the passages. 4.2 Results The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed to determine the statistical significance of the results. In the tables of the following sections, statistically significant improvements (at the 5% level) are marked with an asterisk. 4.2.1 Conceptual IR model vs. term-based model The initial baseline was established using word similarity only computed by the Okapi (Formula 4). Another run based on our basic conceptual IR model was performed without using query expansion, pseudo-feedback, or abbreviation correction. The experimental result is shown in Table 4.2.1. Our basic conceptual IR model significantly outperforms the Okapi on all three levels, which suggests that, although it requires additional efforts to identify concepts, retrieval on the concept level can achieve substantial improvements over purely term-based retrieval model. 4.2.2 Contribution of different types of knowledge A series of experiments were performed to examine how each type of domain-specific knowledge contributes to the retrieval performance. A new baseline was established using the basic conceptual IR model without incorporating any type of domainspecific knowledge. Then five runs were conducted by adding each individual type of domain-specific knowledge. We also conducted a run by adding all types of domain-specific knowledge. Results of these experiments are shown in Table 4.2.2. We found that any available type of domain-specific knowledge improved the performance in passage retrieval. The biggest improvement comes from the lexical variants, which is consistent with the result reported in [3]. This result also indicates that biologists are likely to use different variants of the same concept according to their own writing preferences and these variants might not be collected in the existing biomedical thesauruses. It also suggests that the biomedical IR systems can benefit from the domain-specific knowledge extracted from the literature by text mining systems. Synonyms provided the second biggest improvement. Hypernyms, hyponyms, and implicitly related concepts provided similar degrees of improvement. The overall performance is an accumulative result of adding different types of domain-specific knowledge and it is better than any individual addition. It is clearly shown that the performance is significantly improved (107% on passage level, 63.1% on aspect level, and 49.6% on document level) when the domain-specific knowledge is appropriately incorporated. Although it is not explicitly shown in Table 4.2.3, different types of domain-specific knowledge affect different subsets of queries. More specifically, each of these types (with the exception of the lexical variants which affects a large number of queries) affects only a few queries. But for those affected queries, their improvement is significant. As a consequence, the accumulative improvement is very significant. 4.2.3 Pseudo-feedback and abbreviation correction Using the Baseline+All in Table 4.2.2 as a new baseline, the contribution of abbreviation correction and pseudo-feedback is given in Table 4.2.3. There is little improvement by avoiding incorrect matching of abbreviations. The pseudo-feedback contributed about 4.6% improvement in passage retrieval. 4.2.4 Performance compared with best-reported results We compared our result with the results reported in the Genomics track of TREC 2006 [8] on the conditions that 1) systems are automatic systems and 2) passages are extracted from paragraphs. The performance of our system relative to the best reported results is shown in Table 4.2.4 (in TREC 2006, some systems returned the whole paragraphs as passages. As a consequence, excellent retrieval results were obtained on document and aspect levels at the expense of performance on the passage level. We do not include the results of such systems here).

Notice that the performance was only measured on the document level for the ad-hoc Task of TREC Genomics 2005. 5. RELATED WORKS Many studies used manually-crafted thesauruses or knowledge databases created by text mining systems to improve retrieval effectiveness based on either word-statistical retrieval systems or conceptual retrieval systems. [11][1] assessed query expansion using the UMLS Metathesaurus. Based on a word-statistical retrieval system, [11] used definitions and different types of thesaurus relationships for query expansion and a deteriorated performance was reported. [1] expanded queries with phrases and UMLS concepts determined by the MetaMap, a program which maps biomedical text to UMLS concepts, and no significant improvement was shown. We used MeSH, Entrez gene, and other non-thesaurus knowledge resources such as an abbreviation database for query expansion. A critical difference between our work and those in [11][1] is that our retrieval model is based on concepts, not on individual words. The Genomics track in TREC provides a common platform to evaluate methods and techniques proposed by various groups for biomedical information retrieval. As summarized in [8][9][10], many groups utilized domain-specific knowledge to improve retrieval effectiveness. Among these groups, [3] assessed both thesaurus-based knowledge, such as gene information, and non thesaurus-based knowledge, such as lexical variants of gene symbols, for query expansion. They have shown that query expansion with acronyms and lexical variants of gene symbols produced the biggest improvement, whereas, the query expansion with gene information from gene databases deteriorated the performance. [21] used a similar approach for generating lexical variants of gene symbols and reported significant improvements. Our system utilized more types of domain-specific knowledge, including hyponyms, hypernyms and implicitly related concepts. In addition, under the conceptual retrieval framework, we examined more comprehensively the effects of different types of domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution. [20][15] utilized WordNet, a database of English words and their lexical relationships developed by Princeton University, for query expansion in the non-biomedical domain. In their studies, queries were expanded using the lexical semantic relations such as synonyms, hypernyms, or hyponyms. Little benefit has been shown in [20]. This has been due to ambiguity of the query terms which have different meanings in different contexts. When these synonyms having multiple meanings are added to the query, substantial irrelevant documents are retrieved. In the biomedical domain, this kind of ambiguity of query terms is relatively less frequent, because, although the abbreviations are highly ambiguous, general biomedical concepts usually have only one meaning in the thesaurus, such as UMLS, whereas a term in WordNet usually have multiple meanings (represented as synsets in WordNet). Besides, we have implemented a post-ranking step to reduce the number of incorrect matches of abbreviations, which will hopefully decrease the negative impact caused by the abbreviation ambiguity. Besides, we have implemented a postranking step to reduce the number of incorrect matches of abbreviations, which will hopefully decrease the negative impact caused by the abbreviation ambiguity. The retrieval model in [15] emphasized the similarity between a query and a document on the phrase level assuming that phrases are more important than individual words when retrieving documents. Although the assumption is similar, our conceptual model is based on the biomedical concepts, not phrases. [13] presented a good study of the role of knowledge in the document retrieval of clinical medicine. They have shown that appropriate use of semantic knowledge in a conceptual retrieval framework can yield substantial improvements. Although the retrieval model is similar, we made a study in the domain of genomics, in which the problem structure and task knowledge is not as well-defined as in the domain of clinical medicine [18]. Also, our similarity function is very different from that in [13]. In summary, our approach differs from previous works in four important ways: First, we present a case study of conceptual retrieval in the domain of genomics, where many knowledge resources can be used to improve the performance of biomedical IR systems. Second, we have studied more types of domainspecific knowledge than previous researchers and carried out more comprehensive experiments to look into the effects of different types of domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution. Third, although some of the techniques seem similar to previously published ones, they are actually quite different in details. For example, in our pseudo-feedback process, we require that the unit of feedback is a concept and the concept has to be of the same semantic type as a query concept. This is to ensure that our conceptual model of retrieval can be applied. As another example, the way in which implicitly related concepts are extracted in this paper is significantly different from that given in [19]. Finally, our conceptual IR model is actually based on complex concepts because some biomedical meanings, such as biological processes, are represented by multiple simple concepts. 6. CONCLUSION This paper proposed a conceptual approach to utilize domainspecific knowledge in an IR system to improve its effectiveness in retrieving biomedical literature. We specified five different types of domain-specific knowledge (i.e., synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms, lexical variants, and implicitly related concepts) and examined their effects in performance contribution. We also evaluated other two techniques, pseudo-feedback and abbreviation correction. Experimental results have shown that appropriate use of domain-specific knowledge in a conceptual IR model yields significant improvements (23%) in passage retrieval over the best known results. In our future work, we will explore the use of other existing knowledge resources, such as UMLS and the Wikipedia, and evaluate techniques such as disambiguation of gene symbols for improving retrieval effectiveness. The application of our conceptual IR model in other domains such as clinical medicine will be investigated. 7. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS insightful discussion. 8. REFERENCES [1] Aronson A.R., Rindflesch T.C.

Introducción Los biólogos buscan literatura a diario. Para la mayoría de los biólogos, PubMed, un servicio en línea de la Biblioteca Nacional de Medicina de los EE. UU. (NLM), es la herramienta más utilizada para buscar la literatura biomédica. PubMed permite la búsqueda de palabras clave mediante el uso de operadores booleanos. Por ejemplo, si uno desea documentos sobre el uso del propanolol del fármaco en la hipertensión de la enfermedad, una consulta típica de PubMed podría ser propanolol e hipertensión, lo que devolverá todos los documentos que tienen las dos palabras clave. La búsqueda de palabras clave en PubMed es efectiva si la consulta está bien elaborada por los usuarios que usan su experiencia. Sin embargo, las necesidades de información de los biólogos, en algunos casos, se expresan como preguntas complejas [8] [9], que PubMed no está diseñada para manejar. Si bien NLM mantiene una herramienta experimental para consultas de texto libre [6], todavía se basa en la búsqueda de palabras clave de PubMed. La pista de genómica de la Conferencia de recuperación de texto de 2006 (TREC) proporciona una plataforma común para evaluar los métodos y técnicas propuestas por varios grupos para la recuperación de información biomédica. Las consultas fueron recolectadas de biólogos reales y se expresan como preguntas complejas, como cómo las mutaciones en el gen huntingtin afectan la enfermedad de las cazadoras? La recopilación de documentos contiene 162,259 documentos de texto completo de alto cable en formato HTML. Se espera que los sistemas de grupos participantes encuentren pasajes relevantes dentro de los documentos de texto completo. Un pasaje se define como cualquier tramo de texto que no incluya la etiqueta de párrafo HTML (es decir, <p> o </p>). Abordamos el problema utilizando el conocimiento específico del dominio en un modelo de recuperación conceptual. El conocimiento específico del dominio, en este documento, se refiere a la información sobre conceptos y relaciones entre conceptos en un determinado dominio. Suponemos que el uso apropiado del conocimiento específico del dominio podría mejorar la efectividad de la recuperación. Por ejemplo, dada una consulta, ¿cuál es el papel de Gene PRNP en la enfermedad de las vacas locas?, Ampliando el símbolo del gen PRNP con sus sinónimos PRP, PRPSC y proteína Prión, se pueden recuperar documentos más relevantes. PubMed y muchos otros sistemas biomédicos [8] [9] [10] [13] también hacen uso del conocimiento específico del dominio para mejorar la efectividad de la recuperación. Intuitivamente, la recuperación en el nivel de conceptos debe superar los enfoques de las palabras de las palabras, ya que se utilizan las relaciones semánticas entre las palabras en un concepto. En algunos estudios recientes [13] [15], se han informado resultados positivos para esta hipótesis. En este artículo, los conceptos son términos de entrada de los encabezados de sujetos médicos de ontología (MESH), un vocabulario controlado mantenido por NLM para indexar literatura biomédica, o símbolos genéticos en la base de datos de genes Entrez también de NLM. Un concepto podría ser una palabra, como el símbolo del gen PRNP, o una frase, como las enfermedades de las vacas locas. En el modelo de recuperación conceptual presentado en este documento, la similitud entre una consulta y un documento se mide tanto en los niveles de concepto como de palabras. Este documento hace dos contribuciones: 1. Proponemos un enfoque conceptual para utilizar el conocimiento específico del dominio en un sistema IR para mejorar su efectividad en la recuperación de la literatura biomédica. Según este enfoque, nuestro sistema logró una mejora significativa (23%) sobre el mejor resultado en la recuperación del pasaje en la pista de genómica de TREC 2006. 2. Examinamos los efectos de utilizar conceptos y de diferentes tipos de conocimiento específico de dominio en la contribución del rendimiento. Este documento se organiza de la siguiente manera: la declaración del problema se da en la siguiente sección. Las técnicas se introducen en la Sección 3. En la Sección 4, presentamos los resultados experimentales. Las obras relacionadas se dan en la Sección 5 y finalmente, concluimos el documento en la Sección 6. 2. Declaración del problema Describimos las consultas, la recopilación de documentos y la salida del sistema en esta sección. El conjunto de consultas utilizado en la pista de genómica de TREC 2006 consta de 28 preguntas recopiladas de biólogos reales. Como se describe en [8], todas estas preguntas tienen el siguiente formato general: Relación de objeto biológico (1..m) ← ⎯⎯⎯⎯ → Proceso biológico (1..n) (1) donde un objeto biológico podría ser un gen, la mutación de proteínas o genes y un proceso biológico pueden ser un proceso fisiológico o enfermedad. Una pregunta podría involucrar múltiples objetos biológicos (M) y múltiples procesos biológicos (N). Estas preguntas se derivaron de cuatro plantillas (Tabla 2). Tabla 2 Plantillas de consulta y ejemplos en la pista de genómica de la plantilla TREC 2006 Ejemplo ¿Cuál es el papel del gen en la enfermedad? ¿Cuál es el papel de DRD4 en el alcoholismo? ¿Qué efecto tiene Gene en el proceso biológico? ¿Qué efecto tiene el gen del receptor de insulina sobre la tumorigénesis? ¿Cómo interactúan los genes en la función de los órganos? ¿Cómo interactúan HMG y HMGB1 en la hepatitis? ¿Cómo influye una mutación en el gen biológico? ¿Cómo funciona una mutación en RET tiroidea? Características de las consultas: 1) son diferentes de las consultas web típicas y las consultas de PubMed, las cuales generalmente consisten en 1 a 3 palabras clave;2) Se generan a partir de plantillas estructurales que pueden ser utilizadas por un sistema para identificar los componentes de la consulta, el objeto o proceso biológico. La recopilación de documentos contiene 162,259 documentos de texto completo de alto cable en formato HTML. La salida del sistema es una lista de pasajes clasificados de acuerdo con sus similitudes con la consulta. Un pasaje se define como cualquier tramo de texto que no incluya la etiqueta de párrafo HTML (es decir, <p> o </p>). Un pasaje podría ser parte de una oración, una oración, un conjunto de oraciones consecutivas o un párrafo (es decir, el tramo completo de texto que está dentro de <p> y </p> html etiquetas). Este es un problema de recuperación de información a nivel de paso con el intento de poner a los biólogos en contextos donde se proporciona información relevante.3. Técnicas y métodos Nos abordamos el problema recuperando primero los párrafos más relevantes de Top-K, luego extrayendo pasajes de estos párrafos y finalmente clasificando los pasajes. En este proceso, empleamos varias técnicas y métodos, que se introducirán en esta sección. Primero, damos dos definiciones: Definición 3.1 Un concepto es 1) un término de entrada en la ontología de malla, o 2) un símbolo de gen en la base de datos del gen Entrez. Esta definición de concepto puede generalizarse para incluir otros términos de diccionario biomédico. Definición 3.2 Un tipo semántico es una categoría definida en la red semántica del sistema de lenguaje médico unificado (UMLS) [14]. La liberación actual de la red semántica UMLS contiene 135 tipos semánticos como enfermedad o síndrome. A cada término de entrada en la ontología de malla se le asigna uno o más tipos semánticos. Cada símbolo del gen en la base de datos de genes Entrez se asigna al gen de tipo semántico o al genoma. Además, estos tipos semánticos están vinculados por 54 relaciones. Por ejemplo, el antibiótico previene la enfermedad o el síndrome. Estas relaciones entre los tipos semánticos representan el conocimiento biomédico general. Utilizamos estos tipos semánticos y sus relaciones para identificar conceptos relacionados. El resto de esta sección se organiza de la siguiente manera: en la Sección 3.1, explicamos cómo se identifican los conceptos dentro de una consulta. En la Sección 3.2, especificamos cinco tipos diferentes de conocimiento específico del dominio e presentamos cómo se compilan. En la Sección 3.3, presentamos nuestro modelo IR conceptual. Finalmente, nuestra estrategia para la extracción de pasaje se describe en la Sección 3.4.3.1 Identificar conceptos dentro de una consulta un concepto, definido en la definición 3.1, es un símbolo genético o un término de malla. Usamos las plantillas de consulta para identificar símbolos de genes. Por ejemplo, la consulta ¿Cómo interactúan HMG y HMGB1 en la hepatitis?se deriva de la plantilla ¿Cómo interactúan los genes en la función de los órganos? En este caso, HMG y HMGB1 se identificarán como símbolos genéticos. En los casos en que no se proporcionan las plantillas de consulta, se necesitan programas para el reconocimiento de símbolos genéticos dentro de los textos. Utilizamos la funcionalidad de traducción de consultas de PubMed para extraer términos de malla en una consulta. Esto se realiza enviando toda la consulta a PubMed, que luego devolverá un archivo en el que se etiquetan los términos de malla en la consulta. En la Tabla 3.1, tres términos de malla dentro de la consulta ¿Cuál es el papel de Gene PRNP en la enfermedad de las vacas locas?se encuentran en la traducción de PubMed: encefalopatía, espongiforme bovino para enfermedad de las vacas locas, genes para genes y papel para el papel. Tabla 3.1 La traducción del PubMed de la consulta ¿Cuál es el papel de Gene PRNP en la enfermedad de la vaca loca? Término PubMed Traducción Enfermedad de vaca loca Encefalopatía espongiforme bovina [palabra de texto] o encefalopatía, genes espongiformes bovinos [términos de malla] o genes de vaca loca [palabra de texto] (genes [TIAB] no Medline [SB]) o genes [términos de malla] o genes o genes[Palabra de texto] Rol de rol [términos de malla] o rol [palabra de texto] 3.2 Compilación de conocimiento específico del dominio En este documento, el conocimiento específico del dominio se refiere a la información sobre los conceptos y sus relaciones en un determinado dominio. Utilizamos cinco tipos de conocimiento específico de dominio en el dominio de la genómica: Tipo 1. Sinónimos (términos enumerados en los tesauros que se refieren al mismo significado) Tipo 2. Hypernyms (términos más genéricos, solo un nivel) Tipo 3. Hipónimos (términos más específicos, solo un nivel) Tipo 4. Variantes léxicas (diferentes formas del mismo concepto, como abreviaturas. Se usan comúnmente en la literatura, pero pueden no aparecer en los tesauros) Tipo 5. Conceptos relacionados implícitamente (términos que están semánticamente relacionados y también co-ocurren con más frecuencia que ser independientes en los textos biomédicos) El conocimiento del tipo 1-3 se recupera de los siguientes dos tesauros: 1) Mesh, un vocabulario controlado mantenido por NLM para la indexaciónLiteratura biomédica. La versión 2007 de MESH contiene información sobre 190,000 conceptos. Estos conceptos están organizados en una jerarquía de árboles;2) Entrez Gene, una de las bases de datos de búsqueda más utilizadas de genes. La versión actual del gen Entrez contiene información sobre 1.7 millones de genes. No tiene jerarquía. Solo los sinónimos se recuperan del gen Entrez. La compilación del conocimiento tipo 4-5 se introduce en la Sección 3.2.1 y 3.2.2, respectivamente.3.2.1 Variantes léxicas Variantes léxicas de símbolos de genes Los nuevos símbolos de genes y sus variantes léxicas se introducen regularmente en la literatura biomédica [7]. Sin embargo, muchas bases de datos de referencia, como UMLS y Entrez Gene, pueden no poder realizar un seguimiento de todo este tipo de variantes. Por ejemplo, para el símbolo del gen NF-Kappa B, se pueden encontrar al menos 5 variantes léxicas diferentes en la literatura biomédica: NF-KappaB, NfkappaB, Nfkappa B, NF-KB y NFKB, tres de los cuales no están en la actualUmls y dos no en el gen Entrez.[3] [21] han demostrado que la expansión de los símbolos de genes con sus variantes léxicas mejoró la efectividad de la recuperación de sus sistemas IR biomédicos. En nuestro sistema, empleamos las siguientes dos estrategias para recuperar variantes léxicas de símbolos genéticos. Estrategia I: Esta estrategia es generar automáticamente variantes léxicas de acuerdo con un conjunto de heurísticas elaboradas manualmente [3] [21]. Por ejemplo, dado un símbolo genético PLA2, se genera una variante Plaii de acuerdo con la heurística de que los números romanos y los números árabes son convertibles al nombrar símbolos genéticos. También se genera otra variante, PLA 2, ya que se podría insertar un guión o un espacio en la transición entre caracteres alfabéticos y numéricos en un símbolo de genes. Estrategia II: Esta estrategia es recuperar variantes léxicas de una base de datos de abreviatura. Adam [22] es una base de datos de abreviatura que cubre abreviaturas de uso frecuente y sus definiciones (o formas largas) dentro de Medline, el depósito autorizado de las citas de la literatura biomédica mantenida por el NLM. Dado una consulta, ¿cómo contribuye la difosfato quinasa de nucleósido (NM23) a la progresión del tumor?, Primero identificamos la abreviatura NM23 y su nucleósido diphosfato quinasa de forma larga utilizando el programa de identificación de abreviatura de [4]. Se recuperan la búsqueda de la nucleósido de la difosfato quinasa en Adam, otras abreviaturas, como NDPK o NDK. Estas abreviaturas se consideran las variantes léxicas de NM23. Variantes léxicas de conceptos de malla Adam se usa para obtener las variantes léxicas de los conceptos de malla también. Todas las abreviaturas de un concepto de malla en Adam se consideran variantes léxicas entre sí. Además, esas formas largas que comparten la misma abreviatura con el concepto de malla y son diferentes por una distancia de edición de 1 o 2 también se consideran como sus variantes léxicas. Como ejemplo, los virus del papiloma humano y los papilomavirus humanos tienen la misma abreviatura del VPH en Adán y su distancia de edición es 1. Por lo tanto, se consideran variantes léxicas entre sí. La distancia de edición entre dos cadenas se mide por el número mínimo de inserciones, deleciones y sustituciones de un solo carácter requerido para transformar una cadena en la otra [12].3.2.2 Conceptos relacionados implícitamente Motivación: en algunos casos, hay pocos documentos en la literatura que respondan directamente a una consulta dada. En esta situación, esos documentos que responden implícitamente a sus preguntas o proporcionan información de apoyo serían muy útiles. Por ejemplo, hay pocos documentos en PubMed que respondan directamente a la consulta ¿Cuál es el papel de los genes hnf4 y coup-tf i en la supresión en la función del hígado? Sin embargo, existen algunos documentos sobre el papel de HNF4 y CoP-TF I en la regulación de la transcripción del virus de la hepatitis B. Es muy probable que los biólogos estén interesados en estos documentos porque el virus de la hepatitis B se conoce como un virus que podría causar daños graves a la función del hígado. En el ejemplo dado, el virus de la hepatitis B no es un sinónimo, hiperníno, hipónimo, ni una variante léxica de ninguno de los conceptos de consulta, pero se relaciona semánticamente con los conceptos de consulta de acuerdo con la red semántica de UMLS. Llamamos a este tipo de conceptos relacionados con los conceptos de la consulta implícitamente. Esta noción es similar al término B utilizado en [19] para relacionar dos literaturas disjuntas para la generación de hipótesis biomédica. La diferencia es que utilizamos las relaciones semánticas entre los conceptos de consulta para centrarnos exclusivamente en conceptos de ciertos tipos semánticos. Una consulta Q en formato (1) de la Sección 2 puede representarse por Q = (A, C) donde A es el conjunto de objetos biológicos y C es el conjunto de procesos biológicos. Esos conceptos que están semánticamente relacionados con A y C de acuerdo con la red semántica UMLS se consideran como los conceptos implícitamente relacionados de la consulta. En el ejemplo anterior, a = {hnf4, Coup-tf i}, c = {función del hígado}, y el virus de la hepatitis B es uno de los conceptos implícitamente relacionados. Hacemos uso de la base de datos MEDLINE para extraer los conceptos implícitamente relacionados. La versión 2006 de la base de datos Medline contiene citas (es decir, resúmenes, títulos, etc.) de más de 15 millones de artículos biomédicos. Cada documento en Medline está indexado manualmente por una lista de términos de malla para describir los temas cubiertos por ese documento. Los conceptos implícitamente relacionados se extraen y clasifican en los siguientes pasos: Paso 1. Deje que List_a sea el conjunto de términos de malla que se usan 1) para indexar las citas de Medline que tienen A, y 2) relacionado semánticamente con A Según la red semántica UMLS. Del mismo modo, List_C se crea para C. conceptos en B = List_a ∩ List_c se consideran conceptos implícitamente relacionados de la consulta. Paso 2. Para cada concepto b∈B, calcule la asociación entre B y A usando la medida de información mutua [5]: p (,) (,) log p () p () b a i b a b a = donde p (x) =N/N, N es el número de citas de Medline que tienen X y N es el tamaño de Medline. Un gran valor para I (b, a) significa que B y A co-Oct mucha más frecuencia que ser independiente. I (B, C) se calcula de manera similar. Paso 3. Sea r (b) = (i (b, a), i (b, c)), para b∈ B. Dado B1, B2 ∈ B, decimos R (B1) ≤ R (B2) si I (B1, A) ≤ I (B2, A) e I (B1, C) ≤ I (B2, C). Entonces la asociación entre b y la consulta q se mide por: {: y () ()} (,) {: y () ()} x x b r x r b puntaje b q x x b r r r x ∈ ≤ = ∈ ≤ (2) el numerador enLa fórmula 2 es el número de conceptos en B que están asociados con A y C por igual con o menos de B. El denominador es el número de conceptos en B que están asociados con A y C por igual con o más de B. La Figura 3.2.2 muestra los 4 conceptos principales relacionados implícitamente para la consulta de muestra.

En la Figura 3.2.2, los 4 conceptos principales relacionados implícitamente están altamente asociados con el hígado: los hepatocitos son células hepáticas;El hepatoblastoma es una neoplasia hepática maligna que ocurre en niños pequeños;La gran mayoría de la gluconeogénesis tiene lugar en el hígado;Y el virus de la hepatitis B es un virus que podría causar daños graves a la función del hígado. Los conceptos clasificados de Top-K en B se utilizan para la expansión de la consulta: si I (B, A) ≥ I (B, C), entonces B se considera un concepto relacionado implícito de A. Un documento que tiene B pero no A recibirá un peso parcial de A. La expansión es similar para C cuando I (B, A) <I (B, C).3.3 Modelo IR conceptual ahora discutimos nuestro modelo IR conceptual. Primero damos el modelo IR conceptual básico en la Sección 3.3.1. Luego explicamos cómo se incorpora el conocimiento específico del dominio en el modelo utilizando la expansión de la consulta en la Sección 3.3.2. Se introduce una estrategia de pseudo-retroalimentación en la Sección 3.3.3. En la Sección 3.3.4, damos una estrategia para mejorar la clasificación evitando la coincidencia incorrecta de las abreviaturas.3.3.1 Modelo básico Dada una consulta q y un documento d, nuestro modelo mide dos similitudes, similitud conceptual y similitud de palabras: (,) (,) (,) () Concept Word Sim Q D Sim Q D Sim Q D = Similitud conceptual DosLos vectores se derivan de una consulta Q, 1 2 1 11 12 1 2 21 22 2 (,) (,, ...,) (,, ...,) M N Q V V C C C C V C C C C = = = Donde V1 es un vector de conceptos que describen elLos objetos biológicos y V2 son un vector de conceptos que describen los procesos biológicos. Dado un vector de conceptos V, Sea s (v) el conjunto de conceptos en v. El peso de VI se mide por: () max {log: () () y 0} i i v v n w v s v s v n n = ⊆> donde ves un vector que contiene un subconjunto de conceptos en VI y NV es el número de documentos que tienen todos los conceptos en v. El concepto de similitud entre Q y D se calcula por 2 1 () (,) I I Concepto I W vSim Q D α == × ∑ donde αi es un parámetro para indicar la integridad de VI que el documento D ha cubierto.αi se mide por: e I i i c c d c v c c v idf idf α ∈ ∈ ∈ = ∑ ∑ (3) donde IDFC es la frecuencia de documento inversa del concepto c.Un ejemplo: supongamos que tenemos una consulta ¿Cómo elimina Nurr-77 las células T antes de migrar al bazo o los ganglios linfáticos y cómo impacta esto en la autoinmunidad? Después de identificar los conceptos en la consulta, tenemos: 1 2 (Nurr-77) (células T, bazo, autoinmunidad, ganglios linfáticos) v V = = Suponga que algunas frecuencias de documentos de diferentes combinaciones de conceptos son las siguientes: 25 df (Nurr (Nurr.-77) 0 df (células T, bazo, autoinmunidad, ganglios linfáticos) 326 df (células T, bazo, autoinmunidad) 82 df (bazo, autoinmunidad, ganglios linfáticos) 147 df (células T, autoinmunidad, ganglios linfáticos) 2332 DF (Células T, bazo, ganglios linfáticos) El peso de VI se calcula por (Tenga en cuenta que no existe un documento que tenga todos los conceptos en v2): 1 2 () log ( / 25) () log ( / 82) W V VN W v n = =. Ahora suponga que un documento D contiene conceptos Nurr-77, células T, bazo y ganglios linfáticos, pero no autoinmunidad, entonces el valor del parámetro αi se calcula de la siguiente manera: 1 2 1 (células T)+ (bazo)+ (nodos linfáticos) (Células T)+ (bazo)+ (nodos linfáticos)+ (autoinmunidad) IDF IDF IDF IDF IDF IDF IDF α α = = Similitud de palabras La similitud entre Q y D en el nivel de palabra se calcula usando Okapi [17]: 10.5(1) log () (,) 0.5word w q n k tf sim q d n k tf∈ - + + = + + ∑ (4) donde n es el tamaño de la recopilación de documentos;n es el número de documentos que contienen W;K = K1 × (((1-B)+B × DL/AVDL) y K1 = 1.2, C Función del hígado Conceptos implícitamente relacionados (B) Hepatocitos Hepatoblastoma Gluconeogénesis Virus B HNF4 y CoP-TF I A B = 0.75 son constantes.DL es la longitud del documento de D y AVDL es la longitud promedio del documento;TF es el término frecuencia de W dentro de d.El modelo dado dos documentos D1 y D2, decimos 1 2 (,) (,) Sim Q D Sim Q D> o D1 se clasificará más alto que D2, con respecto a la misma consulta Q, si 1) 1 2 (,)(,) Concepto concepto Sim Q D Sim Q D> o 2) 1 2 1 2 y (,) (,) (,) () Concepto Concepto Palabra Sim Q D Sim Q D Sim Q D Sim Q D => Este modelo IR conceptual enfatiza la similituden el nivel de concepto. Un modelo similar pero aplicado al dominio no biomédico se ha dado en [15].3.3.2 Incorporación del conocimiento específico del dominio Dado un concepto C, un vector U se deriva incorporando su conocimiento específico del dominio: 1 2 3 (,,,) u c u u u = donde u1 es un vector de sus sinónimos, hipónimos y variantes léxicas;U2 es un vector de sus hipernyms;y U3 es un vector de sus conceptos implícitamente relacionados. Una aparición de cualquier término en U1 se contará como una ocurrencia de c.IDFC en Fórmula 3 se actualiza como: 1, Logc C u n D IDF = 1, C UD es el conjunto de documentos que tienen C o cualquier término en 1U. El peso que recibe un documento d de u viene dado por: max {: y} tw t u t d∈ ∈ donde wt = β .cidf × El factor de ponderación β es un parámetro de sintonización empírico determinado como: 1. β = 1 si t es elconcepto original, su sinónimo, su hipónimo o su variante léxica;2. β = 0.95 Si t es un hipernym;3. β = 0.90 × (k-i+1)/k si t es un concepto implícitamente relacionado.k es el número de conceptos seleccionados con clasificación superior implícitamente (ver Sección 3.2.2);I es la posición de T en la clasificación de conceptos implícitamente relacionados.3.3.3 Pseudo-Feedback-Feedback es una técnica comúnmente utilizada para mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperación al agregar nuevos términos a la consulta original. Utilizamos una estrategia de pseudo-retroalimentación modificada descrita en [2]. Paso 1. Sea C el conjunto de conceptos en los 15 principales documentos clasificados. Para cada concepto C en C, calcule la similitud entre C y la consulta Q, el cálculo de SIM (Q, C) se puede encontrar en [2]. Paso 2. Se seleccionan los conceptos clasificados por Top-K de SIM (Q, C). Paso 3. Asociar cada concepto seleccionado C con el concepto CQ en Q que 1) tiene el mismo tipo semántico que C, y 2) está más relacionado con C entre todos los conceptos en q. La asociación entre C y CQ se calcula por: P (,) (,) log P () P () Q Q Q C C I C C C C C = DONDE P (X) = N/N, N es el número de documentos que tienen x y n es elTamaño de la recopilación de documentos. Un documento que tiene C pero no CQ recibe un peso dado por: (0.5 × (k-i+1)/k), qcidf × donde i es la posición de C en la clasificación del paso 2. 3.3.4 Evite la coincidencia incorrecta deAbreviaturas Algunos símbolos genéticos son muy cortos y, por lo tanto, ambiguos. Por ejemplo, el símbolo del gen APC podría ser la abreviatura de muchas formas largas no geniales, como el control de la contaminación del aire, el recuento de placas aeróbicas o la coagulación plasmática de argón. Este paso es evitar la coincidencia incorrecta de las abreviaturas en los documentos mejor clasificados. Dada una abreviatura X con la forma de forma larga en la consulta, escaneamos los documentos clasificados por Top-K (k = 1000) y cuando se encuentra un documento con x, comparamos L con todas las formas largas de X en ese documento. Si ninguna de estas formas largas es igual o cercana a L (es decir, la distancia de edición entre L y la forma larga de X en ese documento es 1 o 2), entonces se resta el concepto de similitud de x.3.4 Extracción del pasaje El objetivo de la extracción del paso es resaltar los fragmentos de texto más relevantes en los párrafos. Un pasaje se define como cualquier tramo de texto que no incluya la etiqueta de párrafo HTML (es decir, <p> o </p>). Un pasaje podría ser parte de una oración, una oración, un conjunto de oraciones consecutivas o un párrafo (es decir, el tramo completo de texto que está dentro de <p> y </p> html etiquetas). También es posible tener más de un pasaje relevante en un solo párrafo. Nuestra estrategia para la extracción de pasaje supone que el pasaje óptimo (s) en un párrafo debería tener todos los conceptos de consulta que tiene todo el párrafo. También deben tener una mayor densidad de conceptos de consulta que otros fragmentos de texto en el párrafo. Supongamos que tenemos una consulta Q y un párrafo p representado por una secuencia de oraciones 1 2 ... .np s s s = Sea C el conjunto de conceptos en Q que ocurren en P y S = φ. Paso 1. Para cada secuencia de oraciones consecutivas 1 ..., i i js s s+ 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, que s = s 1 {...} i i js s s+ ∪ if 1 ... i i js s+ satisface eso:1) Cada concepto de consulta en C ocurre en 1 ... I I JS S+ y 2) No existe k, de modo que i <k <j y cada concepto de consulta en C ocurre en 1 ... i i ks s+ o1 2 ... .k k js s s++ condición 1 requiere 1 ... i i js s+ tener todos los conceptos de consulta en p y condición 2 requiere 1 ... i i js s s+ ser el mínimo. Paso 2. Deje 1Min {1: ...} I I Jl J I S S S S + = - + ∈. Por cada 1 ... i i js s s+ in s, deje 1 {...} i i js s s s s+ = - if (j - i+ 1)> L. Este paso es eliminar esas secuencias de oraciones en S quetienen una menor densidad de conceptos de consulta. Paso 3. Por cada dos secuencias de oraciones consecutivas 1 1 1 2 2 2 21 1 ..., y ... i i j i i js s s s s s s s + + ∈ ∈, si 1 2 1 2 2 1, y 1 I I J J I J ≤ ≤ ≤ + (5)Luego, repita este paso hasta que por cada dos secuencias de oraciones consecutivas en S, la condición (5) no se aplica. Este paso es fusionar esas secuencias de oraciones en S que son adyacentes o superpuestas. Finalmente, las secuencias restantes de oraciones en S se devuelven como los pasajes óptimos en el párrafo P con respecto a la consulta.1 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 {...} {...} {...} I I J I I J I I J S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S + + + = ∪ = - = - 4. Resultados experimentales La evaluación de nuestras técnicas y los resultados experimentales se dan en esta sección. Primero describimos los conjuntos de datos y las métricas de evaluación utilizadas en nuestros experimentos y luego presentamos los resultados.4.1 Conjuntos de datos y métricas de evaluación Nuestros experimentos se realizaron en la plataforma de la pista de genómica de TREC 2006. La recopilación de documentos contiene 162,259 documentos de texto completo de 49 revistas biomédicas de Highwire. El conjunto de consultas consta de 28 consultas recopiladas de biólogos reales. El rendimiento se mide en tres niveles diferentes (pasaje, aspecto y documento) para proporcionar una mejor visión sobre cómo se responde la pregunta desde diferentes perspectivas. Mapa del pasaje: como se describe en [8], esta es una precisión basada en caracteres calculada de la siguiente manera: en cada pasaje recuperado relevante, la precisión se calculará como la fracción de caracteres que se superponen con los pasajes estándar de oro divididos por el número total de caracteres incluidosEn todos los pasajes nominados de este sistema para el tema hasta ese momento. Similar al mapa regular, los pasajes relevantes que no se recuperaron también se agregarán al cálculo, con precisión establecida a 0 para pasajes relevantes no recuperados. Entonces, la media de estas precisiones promedio sobre todos los temas se calculará para calcular la precisión media de pasaje promedio. Mapa de aspecto: una pregunta podría abordarse desde diferentes aspectos. Por ejemplo, la pregunta ¿Cuál es el papel de Gene PRNP en la enfermedad de las vacas locas?podría responderse desde aspectos como diagnóstico, manifestaciones neurológicas o priones/genéticos. Esta medida indica cuán completa se responde la pregunta. Mapa de documentos: esta es la medida IR estándar. La precisión se mide en cada punto donde se obtiene un documento relevante y luego se promedia sobre todos los documentos relevantes para obtener la precisión promedio para una consulta dada. Para un conjunto de consultas, la media de la precisión promedio para todas las consultas es el mapa de ese sistema IR. La salida del sistema es una lista de pasajes clasificados de acuerdo con sus similitudes con la consulta. Las actuaciones en los tres niveles se calculan en función de la clasificación de los pasajes.4.2 Resultados La prueba de rango firmado de Wilcoxon se empleó para determinar la importancia estadística de los resultados. En las tablas de las siguientes secciones, las mejoras estadísticamente significativas (en el nivel del 5%) están marcadas con un asterisco.4.2.1 Modelo IR conceptual versus modelo basado en términos La línea de base inicial se estableció utilizando la similitud de palabras solo calculada por el OKAPI (Fórmula 4). Otra ejecución basada en nuestro modelo IR conceptual básico se realizó sin usar la expansión de consultas, pseudo-retroalimentación o corrección de abreviatura. El resultado experimental se muestra en la Tabla 4.2.1. Nuestro modelo de IR conceptual básico supera significativamente al OKAPI en los tres niveles, lo que sugiere que, aunque requiere esfuerzos adicionales para identificar conceptos, la recuperación en el nivel de concepto puede lograr mejoras sustanciales sobre el modelo de recuperación puramente a término.4.2.2 Contribución de diferentes tipos de conocimiento Se realizó una serie de experimentos para examinar cómo cada tipo de conocimiento específico de dominio contribuye al rendimiento de la recuperación. Se estableció una nueva línea de base utilizando el modelo IR conceptual básico sin incorporar ningún tipo de conocimiento específico de dominios. Luego se realizaron cinco corridas agregando cada tipo individual de conocimiento específico del dominio. También realizamos una ejecución agregando todos los tipos de conocimiento específico de dominio. Los resultados de estos experimentos se muestran en la Tabla 4.2.2. Descubrimos que cualquier tipo disponible de conocimiento específico del dominio mejoró el rendimiento en la recuperación del pasaje. La mayor mejora proviene de las variantes léxicas, lo que es consistente con el resultado informado en [3]. Este resultado también indica que es probable que los biólogos usen diferentes variantes del mismo concepto de acuerdo con sus propias preferencias de escritura y que estas variantes podrían no recolectarse en los dicios biomédicos existentes. También sugiere que los sistemas IR biomédicos pueden beneficiarse del conocimiento específico del dominio extraído de la literatura por sistemas de minería de texto. Los sinónimos proporcionaron la segunda mayor mejora. Los hipernyms, los hiponomas y los conceptos implícitamente relacionados proporcionaron grados similares de mejora. El rendimiento general es un resultado acumulativo de agregar diferentes tipos de conocimiento específico del dominio y es mejor que cualquier adición individual. Se muestra claramente que el rendimiento mejora significativamente (107% en el nivel de paso, 63.1% en el nivel de aspecto y 49.6% en el nivel de documento) cuando el conocimiento específico del dominio se incorpora adecuadamente. Aunque no se muestra explícitamente en la Tabla 4.2.3, diferentes tipos de conocimiento específico de dominio afectan diferentes subconjuntos de consultas. Más específicamente, cada uno de estos tipos (con la excepción de las variantes léxicas que afecta a una gran cantidad de consultas) afecta solo unas pocas consultas. Pero para las consultas afectadas, su mejora es significativa. Como consecuencia, la mejora acumulativa es muy significativa.4.2.3 Corrección de pseudo-retroalimentación y abreviatura utilizando la línea de base+todo en la Tabla 4.2.2 Como una nueva línea de base, la contribución de la corrección de abreviatura y el pseudo-retroalimentación se da en la Tabla 4.2.3. Hay poca mejora al evitar la coincidencia incorrecta de las abreviaturas. El pseudo-retroalimentación contribuyó con una mejora de aproximadamente 4.6% en la recuperación del pasaje.4.2.4 Rendimiento en comparación con los resultados mejor informados, comparamos nuestro resultado con los resultados informados en la pista de genómica de TREC 2006 [8] en las condiciones en que 1) los sistemas son sistemas automáticos y 2) pasajes se extraen de los párrafos. El rendimiento de nuestro sistema en relación con los mejores resultados informados se muestra en la Tabla 4.2.4 (en TREC 2006, algunos sistemas devolvieron los párrafos completos como pasajes. Como consecuencia, se obtuvieron excelentes resultados de recuperación en el documento y los niveles de aspecto a expensas del rendimiento a nivel de paso. No incluimos los resultados de tales sistemas aquí). Tabla 4.2.4 Rendimiento en comparación con los resultados mejor informados. Pasaje Mapa de aspecto Mapa Mapa Documento Mapa Mapa mejor informado Resultados 0.1486 0.3492 0.5320 Nuestros resultados 0.1823 0.3811 0.5391 Mejora 22.68% 9.14% 1.33% Los mejores resultados informados en la primera fila de la Tabla 4.2.4 en tres niveles (pasaje, aspecto y documento) desdediferentes sistemas. Nuestro resultado es de una sola carrera en la recuperación de pasaje en la que es mejor que el mejor resultado reportado en un 22.68% en la recuperación del pasaje y al mismo tiempo, 9.14% mejor en la recuperación de aspecto y 1.33% mejor en la recuperación de documentos (desde el promedio de la promedioNo se informó la precisión de cada consulta individual, no podemos aplicar la prueba de rango firmado de Wilcoxon para calcular la importancia de la diferencia entre nuestro rendimiento y el mejor resultado informado).

El rendimiento general en términos de MAP es del 35.50%, que es aproximadamente 22.92% por encima del mejor resultado informado [9]. Observe que el rendimiento solo se midió en el nivel de documento para la tarea ad-hoc de Trec Genomics 2005. 5. Trabajos relacionados Muchos estudios utilizaron tesauros hechos manualmente o bases de datos de conocimiento creadas por sistemas de minería de texto para mejorar la efectividad de la recuperación basada en sistemas de recuperación estadísticos de palabras o sistemas de recuperación conceptual.[11] [1] evaluó la expansión de la consulta usando el Metathesaurus de UMLS. Basado en un sistema de recuperación estadística de palabras, [11] utilizó definiciones y diferentes tipos de relaciones de tesauro para la expansión de la consulta y se informó un rendimiento deteriorado.[1] ampliaron consultas con frases y conceptos UMLS determinados por el Metamap, un programa que mapea el texto biomédico a los conceptos de UMLS, y no se mostró una mejora significativa. Utilizamos Mesh, Entrez Gene y otros recursos de conocimiento que no son de esteaurio, como una base de datos de abreviatura para la expansión de la consulta. Una diferencia crítica entre nuestro trabajo y aquellos en [11] [1] es que nuestro modelo de recuperación se basa en conceptos, no en palabras individuales. La pista de genómica en TREC proporciona una plataforma común para evaluar métodos y técnicas propuestas por varios grupos para la recuperación de información biomédica. Como se resume en [8] [9] [10], muchos grupos utilizaron el conocimiento específico del dominio para mejorar la efectividad de la recuperación. Entre estos grupos, [3] evaluó tanto el conocimiento basado en el tesauro, como la información génica, y el conocimiento no basado en el tesauro, como las variantes léxicas de los símbolos génicos, para la expansión de la consulta. Han demostrado que la expansión de la consulta con acrónimos y variantes léxicas de símbolos genéticos produjo la mayor mejora, mientras que la expansión de la consulta con información génica de bases de datos de genes deterioró el rendimiento.[21] utilizó un enfoque similar para generar variantes léxicas de símbolos génicos e informó mejoras significativas. Nuestro sistema utilizó más tipos de conocimiento específico de dominio, incluidos hiponomas, hipernyms y conceptos implícitamente relacionados. Además, bajo el marco de recuperación conceptual, examinamos de manera más exhaustiva los efectos de los diferentes tipos de conocimiento específico de dominio en la contribución del rendimiento.[20] [15] utilizó WordNet, una base de datos de palabras en inglés y sus relaciones léxicas desarrolladas por la Universidad de Princeton, para la expansión de la consulta en el dominio no biomédico. En sus estudios, las consultas se ampliaron utilizando las relaciones semánticas léxicas como sinónimos, hipernyms o hiponemas. Se ha mostrado poco beneficio en [20]. Esto se debe a la ambigüedad de los términos de consulta que tienen diferentes significados en diferentes contextos. Cuando estos sinónimos que tienen significados múltiples se agregan a la consulta, se recuperan documentos irrelevantes sustanciales. En el dominio biomédico, este tipo de ambigüedad de los términos de consulta es relativamente menos frecuente, porque, aunque las abreviaturas son altamente ambiguas, los conceptos biomédicos generales generalmente tienen solo un significado en el tesauro, como las UMLS, mientras que un término en Wordnet generalmente tiene múltiplesSignificados (representados como sinsets en WordNet). Además, hemos implementado un paso posterior al rango para reducir el número de coincidencias incorrectas de abreviaturas, lo que con suerte disminuirá el impacto negativo causado por la ambigüedad de la abreviatura. Además, hemos implementado un paso posterior a reducir el número de coincidencias incorrectas de abreviaturas, lo que con suerte disminuirá el impacto negativo causado por la ambigüedad de la abreviatura. El modelo de recuperación en [15] enfatizó la similitud entre una consulta y un documento sobre el nivel de frase suponiendo que las frases son más importantes que las palabras individuales al recuperar documentos. Aunque la suposición es similar, nuestro modelo conceptual se basa en los conceptos biomédicos, no en frases.[13] presentó un buen estudio del papel del conocimiento en la recuperación de documentos de la medicina clínica. Han demostrado que el uso apropiado del conocimiento semántico en un marco de recuperación conceptual puede producir mejoras sustanciales. Aunque el modelo de recuperación es similar, hicimos un estudio en el dominio de la genómica, en el que la estructura del problema y el conocimiento de la tarea no están tan bien definidos como en el dominio de la medicina clínica [18]. Además, nuestra función de similitud es muy diferente de la de [13]. En resumen, nuestro enfoque difiere de los trabajos anteriores de cuatro maneras importantes: primero, presentamos un estudio de caso de recuperación conceptual en el dominio de la genómica, donde se pueden utilizar muchos recursos de conocimiento para mejorar el rendimiento de los sistemas IR biomédicos. En segundo lugar, hemos estudiado más tipos de conocimientos específicos de dominios que los investigadores anteriores y llevamos a cabo experimentos más completos para analizar los efectos de los diferentes tipos de conocimiento específico de dominio en la contribución del rendimiento. Tercero, aunque algunas de las técnicas parecen similares a las publicadas anteriormente, en realidad son bastante diferentes en detalles. Por ejemplo, en nuestro proceso de pseudo-retroalimentación, requerimos que la unidad de retroalimentación sea un concepto y el concepto debe ser del mismo tipo semántico que un concepto de consulta. Esto es para garantizar que se pueda aplicar nuestro modelo conceptual de recuperación. Como otro ejemplo, la forma en que se extraen los conceptos implícitamente relacionados en este documento es significativamente diferente de la dada en [19]. Finalmente, nuestro modelo IR conceptual en realidad se basa en conceptos complejos porque algunos significados biomédicos, como los procesos biológicos, están representados por múltiples conceptos simples.6. Conclusión Este documento propuso un enfoque conceptual para utilizar el conocimiento específico de dominios en un sistema IR para mejorar su efectividad en la recuperación de la literatura biomédica. Especificamos cinco tipos diferentes de conocimiento específico del dominio (es decir, sinónimos, hiponmas, hipernyms, variantes léxicas y conceptos implícitamente relacionados) y examinamos sus efectos en la contribución del rendimiento. También evaluamos otras dos técnicas, pseudo-retroalimentación y corrección de abreviatura. Los resultados experimentales han demostrado que el uso apropiado del conocimiento específico del dominio en un modelo IR conceptual produce mejoras significativas (23%) en la recuperación del pasaje sobre los resultados más conocidos. En nuestro trabajo futuro, exploraremos el uso de otros recursos de conocimiento existentes, como UMLS y Wikipedia, y evaluaremos técnicas como la desambiguación de los símbolos de genes para mejorar la efectividad de la recuperación. Se investigará la aplicación de nuestro modelo IR conceptual en otros dominios, como la medicina clínica.7. Agradecimientos Discusión perspicaz.8. Referencias [1] Aronson A.R., Rindflesch T.C.

        "TECHNIQUES AND METHODS We approached the problem by first retrieving the top-k most relevant paragraphs, then extracting passages from these paragraphs, and finally ranking the passages.",
        "In this process, we employed several techniques and methods, which will be introduced in this section.",
        "First, we give two definitions: Definition 3.1 A concept is 1) a entry term in the MeSH ontology, or 2) a gene symbol in the Entrez gene database.",
        "This definition of concept can be generalized to include other biomedical dictionary terms.",
        "Definition 3.2 A semantic type is a category defined in the Semantic Network of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) [14].",

        "For example, the query How do HMG and HMGB1 interact in hepatitis? is derived from the template How do genes interact in organ function?.",
        "In this case, HMG and HMGB1 will be identified as gene symbols.",
        "In cases where the query templates are not provided, programs for recognition of gene symbols within texts are needed.",
        "We use the query translation functionality of PubMed to extract MeSH terms in a query.",
        "This is done by submitting the whole query to PubMed, which will then return a file in which the MeSH terms in the query are labeled.",
        "In Table 3.1, three MeSH terms within the query What is the role of gene PRNP in the Mad cow disease? are found in the PubMed translation: encephalopathy, bovine spongiform for Mad cow disease, genes for gene, and role for role.",

        "We used five types of domain-specific knowledge in the domain of genomics: Type 1.",
        "Synonyms (terms listed in the thesauruses that refer to the same meaning) Type 2.",
        "Hypernyms (more generic terms, one level only) Type 3.",
        "Hyponyms (more specific terms, one level only) Type 4.",
        "Lexical variants (different forms of the same concept, such as abbreviations.",
        "They are commonly used in the literature, but might not be listed in the thesauruses) Type 5.",
        "Implicitly related concepts (terms that are semantically related and also co-occur more frequently than being independent in the biomedical texts) Knowledge of type 1-3 is retrieved from the following two thesauruses: 1) MeSH, a controlled vocabulary maintained by NLM for indexing biomedical literature.",
        "The 2007 version of MeSH contains information about 190,000 concepts.",
        "These concepts are organized in a tree hierarchy; 2) Entrez Gene, one of the most widely used searchable databases of genes.",
        "The current version of Entrez Gene contains information about 1.7 million genes.",
        "It does not have a hierarchy.",
        "Only synonyms are retrieved from Entrez Gene.",
        "The compiling of type 4-5 knowledge is introduced in section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, respectively. 3.2.1 Lexical variants Lexical variants of gene symbols New gene symbols and their lexical variants are regularly introduced into the biomedical literature [7].",
        "However, many reference databases, such as UMLS and Entrez Gene, may not be able to keep track of all this kind of variants.",
        "For example, for the gene symbol NF-kappa B, at least 5 different lexical variants can be found in the biomedical literature: NF-kappaB, NFkappaB, NFkappa B, NF-kB, and NFkB, three of which are not in the current UMLS and two not in the Entrez Gene. [3][21] have shown that expanding gene symbols with their lexical variants improved the retrieval effectiveness of their biomedical IR systems.",
        "In our system, we employed the following two strategies to retrieve lexical variants of gene symbols.",
        "Strategy I: This strategy is to automatically generate lexical variants according to a set of manually crafted heuristics [3][21].",
        "For example, given a gene symbol PLA2, a variant PLAII is generated according to the heuristic that Roman numerals and Arabic numerals are convertible when naming gene symbols.",
        "Another variant, PLA 2, is also generated since a hyphen or a space could be inserted at the transition between alphabetic and numerical characters in a gene symbol.",
        "Strategy II: This strategy is to retrieve lexical variants from an abbreviation database.",
        "ADAM [22] is an abbreviation database which covers frequently used abbreviations and their definitions (or long-forms) within MEDLINE, the authoritative repository of citations from the biomedical literature maintained by the NLM.",
        "Given a query How does nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NM23) contribute to tumor progression?, we first identify the abbreviation NM23 and its long-form nucleoside diphosphate kinase using the abbreviation identification program from [4].",
        "Searching the long-form nucleoside diphosphate kinase in ADAM, other abbreviations, such as NDPK or NDK, are retrieved.",
        "These abbreviations are considered as the lexical variants of NM23.",
        "Lexical variants of MeSH concepts ADAM is used to obtain the lexical variants of MeSH concepts as well.",
        "All the abbreviations of a MeSH concept in ADAM are considered as lexical variants to each other.",
        "In addition, those long-forms that share the same abbreviation with the MeSH concept and are different by an edit distance of 1 or 2 are also considered as its lexical variants.",
        "As an example, human papilloma viruses and human papillomaviruses have the same abbreviation HPV in ADAM and their edit distance is 1.",
        "Thus they are considered as lexical variants to each other.",
        "The edit distance between two strings is measured by the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions of a single character required to transform one string into the other [12]. 3.2.2 Implicitly related concepts Motivation: In some cases, there are few documents in the literature that directly answer a given query.",
        "In this situation, those documents that implicitly answer their questions or provide supporting information would be very helpful.",
        "For example, there are few documents in PubMed that directly answer the query What is the role of the genes HNF4 and COUP-tf I in the suppression in the function of the liver?.",
        "However, there exist some documents about the role of HNF4 and COUP-tf I in regulating hepatitis B virus transcription.",
        "It is very likely that the biologists would be interested in these documents because hepatitis B virus is known as a virus that could cause serious damage to the function of liver.",
        "In the given example, hepatitis B virus is not a synonym, hypernym, hyponym, nor a lexical variant of any of the query concepts, but it is semantically related to the query concepts according to the UMLS Semantic Network.",
        "We call this type of concepts implicitly related concepts of the query.",
        "This notion is similar to the B-term used in [19] for relating two disjoint literatures for biomedical hypothesis generation.",
        "The difference is that we utilize the semantic relationships among query concepts to exclusively focus on concepts of certain semantic types.",
        "A query q in format (1) of section 2 can be represented by q = (A, C) where A is the set of biological objects and C is the set of biological processes.",
        "Those concepts that are semantically related to both A and C according to the UMLS Semantic Network are considered as the implicitly related concepts of the query.",
        "In the above example, A = {HNF4, COUP-tf I}, C = {function of liver}, and hepatitis B virus is one of the implicitly related concepts.",
        "We make use of the MEDLINE database to extract the implicitly related concepts.",
        "The 2006 version of MEDLINE database contains citations (i.e., abstracts, titles, and etc.) of over 15 million biomedical articles.",
        "Each document in MEDLINE is manually indexed by a list of MeSH terms to describe the topics covered by that document.",
        "Implicitly related concepts are extracted and ranked in the following steps: Step 1.",
        "Let list_A be the set of MeSH terms that are 1) used for indexing those MEDLINE citations having A, and 2) semantically related to A according to the UMLS Semantic Network.",
        "Similarly, list_C is created for C. Concepts in B = list_A ∩ list_C are considered as implicitly related concepts of the query.",
        "Step 2.",
        "For each concept b∈B, compute the association between b and A using the mutual information measure [5]: P( , ) ( , ) log P( )P( ) b A I b A b A = where P(x) = n/N, n is the number of MEDLINE citations having x and N is the size of MEDLINE.",
        "A large value for I(b, A) means that b and A co-occur much more often than being independent.",
        "I(b, C) is computed similarly.",
        "Step 3.",
        "Let r(b) = (I(b, A), I(b, C)), for b∈ B.",
        "Given b1, b2 ∈ B, we say r(b1) ≤ r(b2) if I(b1, A) ≤ I(b2, A) and I(b1, C) ≤ I(b2, C).",
        "Then the association between b and the query q is measured by: { : and ( ) ( )} ( , ) { : and ( ) ( )} x x B r x r b score b q x x B r b r x ∈ ≤ = ∈ ≤ (2) The numerator in Formula 2 is the number of the concepts in B that are associated with both A and C equally with or less than b.",
        "The denominator is the number of the concepts in B that are associated with both A and C equally with or more than b.",
        "Figure 3.2.2 shows the top 4 implicitly related concepts for the sample query.",
        "Figure 3.2.2 Top 4 implicitly related concepts for the query How do interactions between HNF4 and COUP-TF1 suppress liver function?.",
        "In Figure 3.2.2, the top 4 implicitly related concepts are all highly associated with liver: Hepatocytes are liver cells; Hepatoblastoma is a malignant liver neoplasm occurring in young children; the vast majority of Gluconeogenesis takes place in the liver; and Hepatitis B virus is a virus that could cause serious damage to the function of liver.",
        "The top-k ranked concepts in B are used for query expansion: if I(b, A) ≥ I(b, C), then b is considered as an implicit related concept of A.",
        "A document having b but not A will receive a partial weight of A.",
        "The expansion is similar for C when I(b, A) < I(b, C). 3.3 Conceptual IR model We now discuss our conceptual IR model.",
        "We first give the basic conceptual IR model in section 3.3.1.",
        "Then we explain how the domain-specific knowledge is incorporated in the model using query expansion in section 3.3.2.",
        "A pseudo-feedback strategy is introduced in section 3.3.3.",
        "In section 3.3.4, we give a strategy to improve the ranking by avoiding incorrect match of abbreviations. 3.3.1 Basic model Given a query q and a document d, our model measures two similarities, concept similarity and word similarity: ( , ) ( , )( , ) ( , ) concept word sim q d sim q d sim q d= Concept similarity Two vectors are derived from a query q, 1 2 1 11 12 1 2 21 22 2 ( , ) ( , ,..., ) ( , ,..., ) m n q v v v c c c v c c c = = = where v1 is a vector of concepts describing the biological object(s) and v2 is a vector of concepts describing the biological process(es).",
        "Given a vector of concepts v, let s(v) be the set of concepts in v. The weight of vi is then measured by: ( ) max{log : ( ) ( ) and 0}i i v v N w v s v s v n n = ⊆ > where v is a vector that contains a subset of concepts in vi and nv is the number of documents having all the concepts in v. The concept similarity between q and d is then computed by 2 1 ( )( , ) i i concept i w vsim q d α = = ×∑ where αi is a parameter to indicate the completeness of vi that document d has covered. αi is measured by: and i i i c c d c v c c v idf idf α ∈ ∈ ∈ = ∑ ∑ (3) where idfc is the inverse document frequency of concept c. An example: suppose we have a query How does Nurr-77 delete T cells before they migrate to the spleen or lymph nodes and how does this impact autoimmunity?.",
        "After identifying the concepts in the query, we have: 1 2 (Nurr-77) (T cells, spleen, autoimmunity, lymph nodes) v v = = Suppose that some document frequencies of different combinations of concepts are as follows: 25 df(Nurr-77) 0 df(T cells, spleen, autoimmunity, lymph nodes) 326 df(T cells, spleen, autoimmunity) 82 df(spleen, autoimmunity, lymph nodes) 147 df(T cells, autoimmunity, lymph nodes) 2332 df(T cells, spleen, lymph nodes) The weight of vi is then computed by (note that there does not exist a document having all the concepts in v2): 1 2 ( ) log( / 25) ( ) log( /82) w v N w v N = = .",
        "Now suppose a document d contains concepts Nurr-77, T cells, spleen, and lymph nodes, but not autoimmunity, then the value of parameter αi is computed as follows: 1 2 1 (T cells)+ (spleen)+ (lymph nodes) (T cells)+ (spleen)+ (lymph nodes)+ (autoimmunity) idf idf idf idf idf idf idf α α = = Word similarity The similarity between q and d on the word level is computed using Okapi [17]: 10.5 ( 1) log( )( , ) 0.5word w q N n k tf sim q d n K tf∈ − + + = + + ∑ (4) where N is the size of the document collection; n is the number of documents containing w; K=k1 × ((1-b)+b × dl/avdl) and k1=1.2, C Function of Liver Implicitly related concepts (B) Hepatocytes Hepatoblastoma Gluconeogenesis Hepatitis B virus HNF4 and COUP-tf I A b=0.75 are constants. dl is the document length of d and avdl is the average document length; tf is the term frequency of w within d. The model Given two documents d1 and d2, we say 1 2( , ) ( , )sim q d sim q d> or d1 will be ranked higher than d2, with respect to the same query q, if either 1) 1 2( , ) ( , ) concept concept sim q d sim q d> or 2) 1 2 1 2and( , ) ( , ) ( , ) ( , ) concept concept word word sim q d sim q d sim q d sim q d= > This conceptual IR model emphasizes the similarity on the concept level.",
        "A similar model but applied to non-biomedical domain has been given in [15]. 3.3.2 Incorporating domain-specific knowledge Given a concept c, a vector u is derived by incorporating its domain-specific knowledge: 1 2 3( , , , )u c u u u= where u1 is a vector of its synonyms, hyponyms, and lexical variants; u2 is a vector of its hypernyms; and u3 is a vector of its implicitly related concepts.",
        "An occurrence of any term in u1 will be counted as an occurrence of c. idfc in Formula 3 is updated as: 1, logc c u N D idf = 1,c uD is the set of documents having c or any term in 1u .",
        "The weight that a document d receives from u is given by: max{ : and }tw t u t d∈ ∈ where wt = β .cidf× The weighting factor β is an empirical tuning parameter determined as: 1. β = 1 if t is the original concept, its synonym, its hyponym, or its lexical variant; 2. β = 0.95 if t is a hypernym; 3. β = 0.90× (k-i+1)/k if t is an implicitly related concept. k is the number of selected top ranked implicitly related concepts (see section 3.2.2); i is the position of t in the ranking of implicitly related concepts. 3.3.3 Pseudo-feedback Pseudo-feedback is a technique commonly used to improve retrieval performance by adding new terms into the original query.",
        "We used a modified pseudo-feedback strategy described in [2].",
        "Step 1.",
        "Let C be the set of concepts in the top 15 ranked documents.",
        "For each concept c in C, compute the similarity between c and the query q, the computation of sim(q,c) can be found in [2].",
        "Step 2.",
        "The top-k ranked concepts by sim(q,c) are selected.",
        "Step 3.",
        "Associate each selected concept c with the concept cq in q that 1) has the same semantic type as c, and 2) is most related to c among all the concepts in q.",
        "The association between c and cq is computed by: P( , ) ( , ) log P( )P( ) q q q c c I c c c c = where P(x) = n/N, n is the number of documents having x and N is the size of the document collection.",
        "A document having c but not cq receives a weight given by: (0.5× (k-i+1)/k) ,qcidf× where i is the position of c in the ranking of step 2. 3.3.4 Avoid incorrect match of abbreviations Some gene symbols are very short and thus ambiguous.",
        "For example, the gene symbol APC could be the abbreviation for many non-gene long-forms, such as air pollution control, aerobic plate count, or argon plasma coagulation.",
        "This step is to avoid incorrect match of abbreviations in the top ranked documents.",
        "Given an abbreviation X with the long-form L in the query, we scan the top-k ranked (k=1000) documents and when a document is found with X, we compare L with all the long-forms of X in that document.",
        "If none of these long-forms is equal or close to L (i.e., the edit distance between L and the long-form of X in that document is 1 or 2), then the concept similarity of X is subtracted. 3.4 Passage extraction The goal of passage extraction is to highlight the most relevant fragments of text in paragraphs.",
        "A passage is defined as any span of text that does not include the HTML paragraph tag (i.e., <P> or </P>).",
        "A passage could be a part of a sentence, a sentence, a set of consecutive sentences or a paragraph (i.e., the whole span of text that are inside of <P> and </P> HTML tags).",
        "It is also possible to have more than one relevant passage in a single paragraph.",
        "Our strategy for passage extraction assumes that the optimal passage(s) in a paragraph should have all the query concepts that the whole paragraph has.",
        "Also they should have higher density of query concepts than other fragments of text in the paragraph.",
        "Suppose we have a query q and a paragraph p represented by a sequence of sentences 1 2... .np s s s= Let C be the set of concepts in q that occur in p and S = Φ.",
        "Step 1.",
        "For each sequence of consecutive sentences 1... ,i i js s s+ 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, let S = S 1{ ... }i i js s s+∪ if 1...i i js s s+ satisfies that: 1) Every query concept in C occurs in 1...i i js s s+ and 2) There does not exist k, such that i < k < j and every query concept in C occurs in 1...i i ks s s+ or 1 2... .k k js s s+ + Condition 1 requires 1...i i js s s+ having all the query concepts in p and condition 2 requires 1...i i js s s+ be the minimal.",
        "Step 2.",
        "Let 1min{ 1: ... }i i jL j i s s s S+= − + ∈ .",

        "The set of queries consists of 28 queries collected from real biologists.",
        "The performance is measured on three different levels (passage, aspect, and document) to provide better insight on how the question is answered from different perspectives.",
        "Passage MAP: As described in [8], this is a character-based precision calculated as follows: At each relevant retrieved passage, precision will be computed as the fraction of characters overlapping with the gold standard passages divided by the total number of characters included in all nominated passages from this system for the topic up until that point.",
        "Similar to regular MAP, relevant passages that were not retrieved will be added into the calculation as well, with precision set to 0 for relevant passages not retrieved.",
        "Then the mean of these average precisions over all topics will be calculated to compute the mean average passage precision.",
        "Aspect MAP: A question could be addressed from different aspects.",
        "For example, the question what is the role of gene PRNP in the Mad cow disease? could be answered from aspects like Diagnosis, Neurologic manifestations, or Prions/Genetics.",
        "This measure indicates how comprehensive the question is answered.",
        "Document MAP: This is the standard IR measure.",

        "For a set of queries, the mean of the average precision for all queries is the MAP of that IR system.",
        "The output of the system is a list of passages ranked according to their similarities with the query.",
        "The performances on the three levels are then calculated based on the ranking of the passages. 4.2 Results The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed to determine the statistical significance of the results.",
        "In the tables of the following sections, statistically significant improvements (at the 5% level) are marked with an asterisk. 4.2.1 Conceptual IR model vs. term-based model The initial baseline was established using word similarity only computed by the Okapi (Formula 4).",
        "Another run based on our basic conceptual IR model was performed without using query expansion, pseudo-feedback, or abbreviation correction.",
        "The experimental result is shown in Table 4.2.1.",
        "Our basic conceptual IR model significantly outperforms the Okapi on all three levels, which suggests that, although it requires additional efforts to identify concepts, retrieval on the concept level can achieve substantial improvements over purely term-based retrieval model. 4.2.2 Contribution of different types of knowledge A series of experiments were performed to examine how each type of domain-specific knowledge contributes to the retrieval performance.",
        "A new baseline was established using the basic conceptual IR model without incorporating any type of domainspecific knowledge.",

        "The biggest improvement comes from the lexical variants, which is consistent with the result reported in [3].",
        "This result also indicates that biologists are likely to use different variants of the same concept according to their own writing preferences and these variants might not be collected in the existing biomedical thesauruses.",
        "It also suggests that the biomedical IR systems can benefit from the domain-specific knowledge extracted from the literature by text mining systems.",
        "Synonyms provided the second biggest improvement.",
        "Hypernyms, hyponyms, and implicitly related concepts provided similar degrees of improvement.",
        "The overall performance is an accumulative result of adding different types of domain-specific knowledge and it is better than any individual addition.",
        "It is clearly shown that the performance is significantly improved (107% on passage level, 63.1% on aspect level, and 49.6% on document level) when the domain-specific knowledge is appropriately incorporated.",
        "Although it is not explicitly shown in Table 4.2.3, different types of domain-specific knowledge affect different subsets of queries.",
        "More specifically, each of these types (with the exception of the lexical variants which affects a large number of queries) affects only a few queries.",
        "But for those affected queries, their improvement is significant.",
        "As a consequence, the accumulative improvement is very significant. 4.2.3 Pseudo-feedback and abbreviation correction Using the Baseline+All in Table 4.2.2 as a new baseline, the contribution of abbreviation correction and pseudo-feedback is given in Table 4.2.3.",
        "There is little improvement by avoiding incorrect matching of abbreviations.",
        "The pseudo-feedback contributed about 4.6% improvement in passage retrieval. 4.2.4 Performance compared with best-reported results We compared our result with the results reported in the Genomics track of TREC 2006 [8] on the conditions that 1) systems are automatic systems and 2) passages are extracted from paragraphs.",
        "The performance of our system relative to the best reported results is shown in Table 4.2.4 (in TREC 2006, some systems returned the whole paragraphs as passages.",

[11][1] assessed query expansion using the UMLS Metathesaurus.",

        "We used MeSH, Entrez gene, and other non-thesaurus knowledge resources such as an abbreviation database for query expansion.",

        "The Genomics track in TREC provides a common platform to evaluate methods and techniques proposed by various groups for biomedical information retrieval.",
        "As summarized in [8][9][10], many groups utilized domain-specific knowledge to improve retrieval effectiveness.",
        "Among these groups, [3] assessed both thesaurus-based knowledge, such as gene information, and non thesaurus-based knowledge, such as lexical variants of gene symbols, for query expansion.",
        "They have shown that query expansion with acronyms and lexical variants of gene symbols produced the biggest improvement, whereas, the query expansion with gene information from gene databases deteriorated the performance. [21] used a similar approach for generating lexical variants of gene symbols and reported significant improvements.",
        "Our system utilized more types of domain-specific knowledge, including hyponyms, hypernyms and implicitly related concepts.",
        "In addition, under the conceptual retrieval framework, we examined more comprehensively the effects of different types of domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution. [20][15] utilized WordNet, a database of English words and their lexical relationships developed by Princeton University, for query expansion in the non-biomedical domain.",
        "In their studies, queries were expanded using the lexical semantic relations such as synonyms, hypernyms, or hyponyms.",
        "Little benefit has been shown in [20].",
        "This has been due to ambiguity of the query terms which have different meanings in different contexts.",
        "When these synonyms having multiple meanings are added to the query, substantial irrelevant documents are retrieved.",
        "In the biomedical domain, this kind of ambiguity of query terms is relatively less frequent, because, although the abbreviations are highly ambiguous, general biomedical concepts usually have only one meaning in the thesaurus, such as UMLS, whereas a term in WordNet usually have multiple meanings (represented as synsets in WordNet).",
        "Besides, we have implemented a post-ranking step to reduce the number of incorrect matches of abbreviations, which will hopefully decrease the negative impact caused by the abbreviation ambiguity.",

        "The retrieval model in [15] emphasized the similarity between a query and a document on the phrase level assuming that phrases are more important than individual words when retrieving documents.",
        "Although the assumption is similar, our conceptual model is based on the biomedical concepts, not phrases. [13] presented a good study of the role of knowledge in the document retrieval of clinical medicine.",

        "Also, our similarity function is very different from that in [13].",
        "In summary, our approach differs from previous works in four important ways: First, we present a case study of conceptual retrieval in the domain of genomics, where many knowledge resources can be used to improve the performance of biomedical IR systems.",
        "Second, we have studied more types of domainspecific knowledge than previous researchers and carried out more comprehensive experiments to look into the effects of different types of domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution.",
        "Third, although some of the techniques seem similar to previously published ones, they are actually quite different in details.",
        "For example, in our pseudo-feedback process, we require that the unit of feedback is a concept and the concept has to be of the same semantic type as a query concept.",
        "This is to ensure that our conceptual model of retrieval can be applied.",
        "As another example, the way in which implicitly related concepts are extracted in this paper is significantly different from that given in [19].",
        "Finally, our conceptual IR model is actually based on complex concepts because some biomedical meanings, such as biological processes, are represented by multiple simple concepts. 6.",
        "CONCLUSION This paper proposed a conceptual approach to utilize domainspecific knowledge in an IR system to improve its effectiveness in retrieving biomedical literature.",
        "We specified five different types of domain-specific knowledge (i.e., synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms, lexical variants, and implicitly related concepts) and examined their effects in performance contribution.",
        "We also evaluated other two techniques, pseudo-feedback and abbreviation correction.",
        "Experimental results have shown that appropriate use of domain-specific knowledge in a conceptual IR model yields significant improvements (23%) in passage retrieval over the best known results.",

                "These concepts are organized in a tree hierarchy; 2) Entrez Gene, one of the most widely used searchable databases of genes.",
                "The current version of Entrez Gene contains information about 1.7 million genes.",
                "It does not have a hierarchy.",

                "However, many reference databases, such as UMLS and Entrez Gene, may not be able to keep track of all this kind of variants.",
                "For example, for the gene symbol NF-kappa B, at least 5 different lexical variants can be found in the biomedical literature: NF-kappaB, NFkappaB, NFkappa B, NF-kB, and NFkB, three of which are not in the current UMLS and two not in the Entrez Gene. [3][21] have shown that expanding gene symbols with their lexical variants improved the retrieval effectiveness of their biomedical IR systems.",
                "In our system, we employed the following two strategies to retrieve lexical variants of gene symbols.",
                "Strategy I: This strategy is to automatically generate lexical variants according to a set of manually crafted heuristics [3][21].",
                "For example, given a gene symbol PLA2, a variant PLAII is generated according to the heuristic that Roman numerals and Arabic numerals are convertible when naming gene symbols.",
                "Another variant, PLA 2, is also generated since a hyphen or a space could be inserted at the transition between alphabetic and numerical characters in a gene symbol.",
                "Strategy II: This strategy is to retrieve lexical variants from an abbreviation database.",
                "ADAM [22] is an abbreviation database which covers frequently used abbreviations and their definitions (or long-forms) within MEDLINE, the authoritative repository of citations from the biomedical literature maintained by the NLM.",
                "Given a query How does nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NM23) contribute to tumor progression?, we first identify the abbreviation NM23 and its long-form nucleoside diphosphate kinase using the abbreviation identification program from [4].",
                "Searching the long-form nucleoside diphosphate kinase in ADAM, other abbreviations, such as NDPK or NDK, are retrieved.",
                "These abbreviations are considered as the lexical variants of NM23.",
                "Lexical variants of MeSH concepts ADAM is used to obtain the lexical variants of MeSH concepts as well.",
                "All the abbreviations of a MeSH concept in ADAM are considered as lexical variants to each other.",
                "In addition, those long-forms that share the same abbreviation with the MeSH concept and are different by an edit distance of 1 or 2 are also considered as its lexical variants.",
                "As an example, human papilloma viruses and human papillomaviruses have the same abbreviation HPV in ADAM and their edit distance is 1.",
                "Thus they are considered as lexical variants to each other.",
                "The edit distance between two strings is measured by the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions of a single character required to transform one string into the other [12]. 3.2.2 Implicitly related concepts Motivation: In some cases, there are few documents in the literature that directly answer a given query.",
                "In this situation, those documents that implicitly answer their questions or provide supporting information would be very helpful.",
                "For example, there are few documents in PubMed that directly answer the query What is the role of the genes HNF4 and COUP-tf I in the suppression in the function of the liver?.",
                "However, there exist some documents about the role of HNF4 and COUP-tf I in regulating hepatitis B virus transcription.",
                "It is very likely that the biologists would be interested in these documents because hepatitis B virus is known as a virus that could cause serious damage to the function of liver.",
                "In the given example, hepatitis B virus is not a synonym, hypernym, hyponym, nor a lexical variant of any of the query concepts, but it is semantically related to the query concepts according to the UMLS Semantic Network.",
                "We call this type of concepts implicitly related concepts of the query.",
                "This notion is similar to the B-term used in [19] for relating two disjoint literatures for biomedical hypothesis generation.",
                "The difference is that we utilize the semantic relationships among query concepts to exclusively focus on concepts of certain semantic types.",
                "A query q in format (1) of section 2 can be represented by q = (A, C) where A is the set of biological objects and C is the set of biological processes.",
