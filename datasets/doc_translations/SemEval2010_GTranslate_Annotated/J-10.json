Previous work has demonstrated that contradictory reporting and underlying user biases make judging the true worth of a service difficult. In this paper, we investigate underlying factors that influence user behavior when reporting feedback. We look at two sources of information besides numerical ratings: linguistic evidence from the textual comment accompanying a review, and patterns in the time sequence of reports. We first show that groups of users who amply discuss a certain feature are more likely to agree on a common rating for that feature. Second, we show that a users rating partly reflects the difference between true quality and prior expectation of quality as inferred from previous reviews. Both give us a less noisy way to produce rating estimates and reveal the reasons behind user bias. Our hypotheses were validated by statistical evidence from hotel reviews on the TripAdvisor website. Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Social and Behavioral Sciences]: Economics General Terms Economics, Experimentation, Reliability 1. MOTIVATIONS The spread of the internet has made it possible for online feedback forums (or reputation mechanisms) to become an important channel for Word-of-mouth regarding products, services or other types of commercial interactions. Numerous empirical studies [10, 15, 13, 5] show that buyers seriously consider online feedback when making purchasing decisions, and are willing to pay reputation premiums for products or services that have a good reputation. Recent analysis, however, raises important questions regarding the ability of existing forums to reflect the real quality of a product. In the absence of clear incentives, users with a moderate outlook will not bother to voice their opinions, which leads to an unrepresentative sample of reviews. For example, [12, 1] show that Amazon1 ratings of books or CDs follow with great probability bi-modal, U-shaped distributions where most of the ratings are either very good, or very bad. Controlled experiments, on the other hand, reveal opinions on the same items that are normally distributed. Under these circumstances, using the arithmetic mean to predict quality (as most forums actually do) gives the typical user an estimator with high variance that is often false. Improving the way we aggregate the information available from online reviews requires a deep understanding of the underlying factors that bias the rating behavior of users. Hu et al. [12] propose the Brag-and-Moan Model where users rate only if their utility of the product (drawn from a normal distribution) falls outside a median interval. The authors conclude that the model explains the empirical distribution of reports, and offers insights into smarter ways of estimating the true quality of the product. In the present paper we extend this line of research, and attempt to explain further facts about the behavior of users when reporting online feedback. Using actual hotel reviews from the TripAdvisor2 website, we consider two additional sources of information besides the basic numerical ratings submitted by users. The first is simple linguistic evidence from the textual review that usually accompanies the numerical ratings. We use text-mining techniques similar to [7] and [3], however, we are only interested in identifying what aspects of the service the user is discussing, without computing the semantic orientation of the text. We find that users who comment more on the same feature are more likely to agree on a common numerical rating for that particular feature. Intuitively, lengthy comments reveal the importance of the feature to the user. Since people tend to be more knowledgeable in the aspects they consider important, users who discuss a given feature in more details might be assumed to have more authority in evaluating that feature. Second we investigate the relationship between a review 1 http://www.amazon.com 2 http://www.tripadvisor.com/ 134 Figure 1: The TripAdvisor page displaying reviews for a popular Boston hotel. Name of hotel and advertisements were deliberatively erased. and the reviews that preceded it. A perusal of online reviews shows that ratings are often part of discussion threads, where one post is not necessarily independent of other posts. One may see, for example, users who make an effort to contradict, or vehemently agree with, the remarks of previous users. By analyzing the time sequence of reports, we conclude that past reviews influence the future reports, as they create some prior expectation regarding the quality of service. The subjective perception of the user is influenced by the gap between the prior expectation and the actual performance of the service [17, 18, 16, 21] which will later reflect in the users rating. We propose a model that captures the dependence of ratings on prior expectations, and validate it using the empirical data we collected. Both results can be used to improve the way reputation mechanisms aggregate the information from individual reviews. Our first result can be used to determine a featureby-feature estimate of quality, where for each feature, a different subset of reviews (i.e., those with lengthy comments of that feature) is considered. The second leads to an algorithm that outputs a more precise estimate of the real quality. 2. THE DATA SET We use in this paper real hotel reviews collected from the popular travel site TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor indexes hotels from cities across the world, along with reviews written by travelers. Users can search the site by giving the hotels name and location (optional). The reviews for a given hotel are displayed as a list (ordered from the most recent to the oldest), with 5 reviews per page. The reviews contain: • information about the author of the review (e.g., dates of stay, username of the reviewer, location of the reviewer); • the overall rating (from 1, lowest, to 5, highest); • a textual review containing a title for the review, free comments, and the main things the reviewer liked and disliked; • numerical ratings (from 1, lowest, to 5, highest) for different features (e.g., cleanliness, service, location, etc.) Below the name of the hotel, TripAdvisor displays the address of the hotel, general information (number of rooms, number of stars, short description, etc), the average overall rating, the TripAdvisor ranking, and an average rating for each feature. Figure 1 shows the page for a popular Boston hotel whose name (along with advertisements) was explicitly erased. We selected three cities for this study: Boston, Sydney and Las Vegas. For each city we considered all hotels that had at least 10 reviews, and recorded all reviews. Table 1 presents the number of hotels considered in each city, the total number of reviews recorded for each city, and the distribution of hotels with respect to the star-rating (as available on the TripAdvisor site). Note that not all hotels have a star-rating. Table 1: A summary of the data set. City # Reviews # Hotels # of Hotels with 1,2,3,4 & 5 stars Boston 3993 58 1+3+17+15+2 Sydney 1371 47 0+0+9+13+10 Las Vegas 5593 40 0+3+10+9+6 For each review we recorded the overall rating, the textual review (title and body of the review) and the numerical rating on 7 features: Rooms(R), Service(S), Cleanliness(C), Value(V), Food(F), Location(L) and Noise(N). TripAdvisor does not require users to submit anything other than the overall rating, hence a typical review rates few additional features, regardless of the discussion in the textual comment. Only the features Rooms(R), Service(S), Cleanliness(C) and Value(V) are rated by a significant number of users. However, we also selected the features Food(F), Location(L) and Noise(N) because they are referred to in a significant number of textual comments. For each feature we record the numerical rating given by the user, or 0 when the rating is missing. The typical length of the textual comment amounts to approximately 200 words. All data was collected by crawling the TripAdvisor site in September 2006. 2.1 Formal notation We will formally refer to a review by a tuple (r, T) where: • r = (rf ) is a vector containing the ratings rf ∈ {0, 1, . . . 5} for the features f ∈ F = {O, R, S, C, V, F, L, N}; note that the overall rating, rO, is abusively recorded as the rating for the feature Overall(O); • T is the textual comment that accompanies the review. 135 Reviews are indexed according to the variable i, such that (ri , Ti ) is the ith review in our database. Since we dont record the username of the reviewer, we will also say that the ith review in our data set was submitted by user i. When we need to consider only the reviews of a given hotel, h, we will use (ri(h) , Ti(h) ) to denote the ith review about the hotel h. 3. EVIDENCE FROM TEXTUAL COMMENTS The free textual comments associated to online reviews are a valuable source of information for understanding the reasons behind the numerical ratings left by the reviewers. The text may, for example, reveal concrete examples of aspects that the user liked or disliked, thus justifying some of the high, respectively low ratings for certain features. The text may also offer guidelines for understanding the preferences of the reviewer, and the weights of different features when computing an overall rating. The problem, however, is that free textual comments are difficult to read. Users are required to scroll through many reviews and read mostly repetitive information. Significant improvements would be obtained if the reviews were automatically interpreted and aggregated. Unfortunately, this seems a difficult task for computers since human users often use witty language, abbreviations, cultural specific phrases, and the figurative style. Nevertheless, several important results use the textual comments of online reviews in an automated way. Using well established natural language techniques, reviews or parts of reviews can be classified as having a positive or negative semantic orientation. Pang et al. [2] classify movie reviews into positive/negative by training three different classifiers (Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy and SVM) using classification features based on unigrams, bigrams or part-of-speech tags. Dave et al. [4] analyze reviews from CNet and Amazon, and surprisingly show that classification features based on unigrams or bigrams perform better than higher-order n-grams. This result is challenged by Cui et al. [3] who look at large collections of reviews crawled from the web. They show that the size of the data set is important, and that bigger training sets allow classifiers to successfully use more complex classification features based on n-grams. Hu and Liu [11] also crawl the web for product reviews and automatically identify product attributes that have been discussed by reviewers. They use Wordnet to compute the semantic orientation of product evaluations and summarize user reviews by extracting positive and negative evaluations of different product features. Popescu and Etzioni [20] analyze a similar setting, but use search engine hit-counts to identify product attributes; the semantic orientation is assigned through the relaxation labeling technique. Ghose et al. [7, 8] analyze seller reviews from the Amazon secondary market to identify the different dimensions (e.g., delivery, packaging, customer support, etc.) of reputation. They parse the text, and tag the part-of-speech for each word. Frequent nouns, noun phrases and verbal phrases are identified as dimensions of reputation, while the corresponding modifiers (i.e., adjectives and adverbs) are used to derive numerical scores for each dimension. The enhanced reputation measure correlates better with the pricing information observed in the market. Pavlou and Dimoka [19] analyze eBay reviews and find that textual comments have an important impact on reputation premiums. Our approach is similar to the previously mentioned works, in the sense that we identify the aspects (i.e., hotel features) discussed by the users in the textual reviews. However, we do not compute the semantic orientation of the text, nor attempt to infer missing ratings. We define the weight, wi f , of feature f ∈ F in the text Ti associated with the review (ri , Ti ), as the fraction of Ti dedicated to discussing aspects (both positive and negative) related to feature f. We propose an elementary method to approximate the values of these weights. For each feature we manually construct the word list Lf containing approximately 50 words that are most commonly associated to the feature f. The initial words were selected from reading some of the reviews, and seeing what words coincide with discussion of which features. The list was then extended by adding all thesaurus entries that were related to the initial words. Finally, we brainstormed for missing words that would normally be associated with each of the features. Let Lf ∩Ti be the list of terms common to both Lf and Ti. Each term of Lf is counted the number of times it appears in Ti , with two exceptions: • in cases where the user submits a title to the review, we account for the title text by appending it three times to the review text Ti . The intuitive assumption is that the users opinion is more strongly reflected in the title, rather than in the body of the review. For example, many reviews are accurately summarized by titles such as Excellent service, terrible location or Bad value for money; • certain words that occur only once in the text are counted multiple times if their relevance to that feature is particularly strong. These were root words for each feature (e.g., staff is a root word for the feature Service), and were weighted either 2 or 3. Each feature was assigned up to 3 such root words, so almost all words are counted only once. The list of words for the feature Rooms is given for reference in Appendix A. The weight wi f is computed as: wi f = |Lf ∩ Ti| f∈F |Lf ∩ Ti| (1) where |Lf ∩Ti | is the number of terms common to Lf and Ti . The weight for the feature Overall was set to min{ |T i | 5000 , 1} where |Ti | is the number of character in Ti . The following is a TripAdvisor review for a Boston hotel (the name of the hotel is omitted): Ill start by saying that Im more of a Holiday Inn person than a *** type. So I get frustrated when I pay double the room rate and get half the amenities that Id get at a Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn. The location was definitely the main asset of this place. It was only a few blocks from the Hynes Center subway stop and it was easy to walk to some good restaurants in the Back Bay area. Boylston isnt far off at all. So I had no trouble with foregoing a rental car and taking the subway from the airport to the hotel and using the subway for any other travel. Otherwise, they make you pay for anything and everything. 136 And when youve already dropped $215/night on the room, that gets frustrating.The room itself was decent, about what I would expect. Staff was also average, not bad and not excellent. Again, I think youre paying for location and the ability to walk to a lot of good stuff. But I think next time Ill stay in Brookline, get more amenities, and use the subway a bit more. This numerical ratings associated to this review are rO = 3, rR = 3, rS = 3, rC = 4, rV = 2 for features Overall(O), Rooms(R), Service(S), Cleanliness(C) and Value(V) respectively. The ratings for the features Food(F), Location(L) and Noise(N) are absent (i.e., rF = rL = rN = 0). The weights wf are computed from the following lists of common terms: LR ∩ T ={room}; wR = 0.066 LS ∩ T ={3 * Staff, amenities}; wS = 0.267 LC ∩ T = ∅; wC = 0 LV ∩ T ={$, rate}; wV = 0.133 LF ∩ T ={restaurant}; wF = 0.067 LL ∩ T ={2 * center, 2 * walk, 2 * location, area}; wL = 0.467 LN ∩ T = ∅; wN = 0 The root words Staff and Center were tripled and doubled respectively. The overall weight of the textual review is wO = 0.197. These values account reasonably well for the weights of different features in the discussion of the reviewer. One point to note is that some terms in the lists Lf possess an inherent semantic orientation. For example the word grime (belonging to the list LC ) would be used most often to assert the presence, and not the absence of grime. This is unavoidable, but care was taken to ensure words from both sides of the spectrum were used. For this reason, some lists such as LR contain only nouns of objects that one would typically describe in a room (see Appendix A). The goal of this section is to analyse the influence of the weights wi f on the numerical ratings ri f . Intuitively, users who spent a lot of their time discussing a feature f (i.e., wi f is high) had something to say about their experience with regard to this feature. Obviously, feature f is important for user i. Since people tend to be more knowledgeable in the aspects they consider important, our hypothesis is that the ratings ri f (corresponding to high weights wi f ) constitute a subset of expert ratings for feature f. Figure 2 plots the distribution of the rates r i(h) C with respect to the weights w i(h) C for the cleanliness of a Las Vegas hotel, h. Here, the high ratings are restricted to the reviews that discuss little the cleanliness. Whenever cleanliness appears in the discussion, the ratings are low. Many hotels exhibit similar rating patterns for various features. Ratings corresponding to low weights span the whole spectrum from 1 to 5, while the ratings corresponding to high weights are more grouped together (either around good or bad ratings). We therefore make the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1. The ratings ri f corresponding to the reviews where wi f is high, are more similar to each other than to the overall collection of ratings. To test the hypothesis, we take the entire set of reviews, and feature by feature, we compute the standard deviation of the ratings with high weights, and the standard deviation of the entire set of ratings. High weights were defined as those belonging to the upper 20% of the weight range for the corresponding feature. If Hypothesis 1 were true, the standard deviation of all ratings should be higher than the standard deviation of the ratings with high weights. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 Rating Weight Figure 2: The distribution of ratings against the weight of the cleanliness feature. We use a standard T-test to measure the significance of the results. City by city and feature by feature, Table 2 presents the average standard deviation of all ratings, and the average standard deviation of ratings with high weights. Indeed, the ratings with high weights have lower standard deviation, and the results are significant at the standard 0.05 significance threshold (although for certain cities taken independently there doesnt seem to be a significant difference, the results are significant for the entire data set). Please note that only the features O,R,S,C and V were considered, since for the others (F, L, and N) we didnt have enough ratings.

We can, for example, construct a feature-by-feature quality estimate with much lower variance: for each feature we take the subset of reviews that amply discuss that feature, and output as a quality estimate the average rating for this subset. Initial experiments suggest that the average feature-by-feature ratings computed in this way are different from the average ratings computed on the whole data set. Given that, indeed, high weights are indicators of expert opinions, the estimates obtained in this way are more accurate than the current ones. Nevertheless, the validation of this underlying assumption requires further controlled experiments. 137 4. THE INFLUENCE OF PAST RATINGS Two important assumptions are generally made about reviews submitted to online forums. The first is that ratings truthfully reflect the quality observed by the users; the second is that reviews are independent from one another. While anecdotal evidence [9, 22] challenges the first assumption3 , in this section, we address the second. A perusal of online reviews shows that reviews are often part of discussion threads, where users make an effort to contradict, or vehemently agree with the remarks of previous users. Consider, for example, the following review: I dont understand the negative reviews... the hotel was a little dark, but that was the style. It was very artsy. Yes it was close to the freeway, but in my opinion the sound of an occasional loud car is better than hearing the ding ding of slot machines all night! The staff on-hand is FABULOUS. The waitresses are great (and *** does not deserve the bad review she got, she was 100% attentive to us!), the bartenders are friendly and professional at the same time... Here, the user was disturbed by previous negative reports, addressed these concerns, and set about trying to correct them. Not surprisingly, his ratings were considerably higher than the average ratings up to this point. It seems that TripAdvisor users regularly read the reports submitted by previous users before booking a hotel, or before writing a review. Past reviews create some prior expectation regarding the quality of service, and this expectation has an influence on the submitted review. We believe this observation holds for most online forums. The subjective perception of quality is directly proportional to how well the actual experience meets the prior expectation, a fact confirmed by an important line of econometric and marketing research [17, 18, 16, 21]. The correlation between the reviews has also been confirmed by recent research on the dynamics of online review forums [6]. 4.1 Prior Expectations We define the prior expectation of user i regarding the feature f, as the average of the previously available ratings on the feature f4 : ef (i) = j<i,r j f =0 rj f j<i,r j f =0 1 As a first hypothesis, we assert that the rating ri f is a function of the prior expectation ef (i): Hypothesis 2. For a given hotel and feature, given the reviews i and j such that ef (i) is high and ef (j) is low, the rating rj f exceeds the rating ri f . We define high and low expectations as those that are above, respectively below a certain cutoff value θ. The set of reviews preceded by high, respectively low expectations 3 part of Amazon reviews were recognized as strategic posts by book authors or competitors 4 if no previous ratings were assigned for feature f, ef (i) is assigned a default value of 4. Table 3: Average ratings for reviews preceded by low (first value in the cell) and high (second value in the cell) expectations. The P-values for a positive difference are given square brackets. City O R S C V 3.953 4.045 3.985 4.252 3.946 Boston 3.364 3.590 3.485 3.641 3.242 [0.011] [0.028] [0.0086] [0.0168] [0.0034] 4.284 4.358 4.064 4.530 4.428 Sydney 3.756 3.537 3.436 3.918 3.495 [0.000] [0.000] [0.035] [0.009] [0.000] 3.494 3.674 3.713 3.689 3.580 Las Vegas 3.140 3.530 2.952 3.530 3.351 [0.190] [0.529] [0.007] [0.529] [0.253] are defined as follows: Rhigh f = {ri f |ef (i) > θ} Rlow f = {ri f |ef (i) < θ} These sets are specific for each (hotel, feature) pair, and in our experiments we took θ = 4. This rather high value is close to the average rating across all features across all hotels, and is justified by the fact that our data set contains mostly high quality hotels. For each city, we take all hotels and compute the average ratings in the sets Rhigh f and Rlow f (see Table 3). The average rating amongst reviews following low prior expectations is significantly higher than the average rating following high expectations. As further evidence, we consider all hotels for which the function eV (i) (the expectation for the feature Value) has a high value (greater than 4) for some i, and a low value (less than 4) for some other i. Intuitively, these are the hotels for which there is a minimal degree of variation in the timely sequence of reviews: i.e., the cumulative average of ratings was at some point high and afterwards became low, or vice-versa. Such variations are observed for about half of all hotels in each city. Figure 3 plots the median (across considered hotels) rating, rV , when ef (i) is not more than x but greater than x − 0.5. 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 Medianofrating expectation Boston Sydney Vegas Figure 3: The ratings tend to decrease as the expectation increases. 138 There are two ways to interpret the function ef (i): • The expected value for feature f obtained by user i before his experience with the service, acquired by reading reports submitted by past users. In this case, an overly high value for ef (i) would drive the user to submit a negative report (or vice versa), stemming from the difference between the actual value of the service, and the inflated expectation of this value acquired before his experience. • The expected value of feature f for all subsequent visitors of the site, if user i were not to submit a report. In this case, the motivation for a negative report following an overly high value of ef is different: user i seeks to correct the expectation of future visitors to the site. Unlike the interpretation above, this does not require the user to derive an a priori expectation for the value of f. Note that neither interpretation implies that the average up to report i is inversely related to the rating at report i. There might exist a measure of influence exerted by past reports that pushes the user behind report i to submit ratings which to some extent conforms with past reports: a low value for ef (i) can influence user i to submit a low rating for feature f because, for example, he fears that submitting a high rating will make him out to be a person with low standards5 . This, at first, appears to contradict Hypothesis 2. However, this conformity rating cannot continue indefinitely: once the set of reports project a sufficiently deflated estimate for vf , future reviewers with comparatively positive impressions will seek to correct this misconception. 4.2 Impact of textual comments on quality expectation Further insight into the rating behavior of TripAdvisor users can be obtained by analyzing the relationship between the weights wf and the values ef (i). In particular, we examine the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 3. When a large proportion of the text of a review discusses a certain feature, the difference between the rating for that feature and the average rating up to that point tends to be large. The intuition behind this claim is that when the user is adamant about voicing his opinion regarding a certain feature, his opinion differs from the collective opinion of previous postings. This relies on the characteristic of reputation systems as feedback forums where a user is interested in projecting his opinion, with particular strength if this opinion differs from what he perceives to be the general opinion. To test Hypothesis 3 we measure the average absolute difference between the expectation ef (i) and the rating ri f when the weight wi f is high, respectively low. Weights are classified high or low by comparing them with certain cutoff values: wi f is low if smaller than 0.1, while wi f is high if greater than θf . Different cutoff values were used for different features: θR = 0.4, θS = 0.4, θC = 0.2, and θV = 0.7. Cleanliness has a lower cutoff since it is a feature rarely discussed; Value has a high cutoff for the opposite reason. Results are presented in Table 4. 5 The idea that negative reports can encourage further negative reporting has been suggested before [14] Table 4: Average of |ri f −ef (i)| when weights are high (first value in the cell) and low (second value in the cell) with P-values for the difference in sq. brackets. City R S C V 1.058 1.208 1.728 1.356 Boston 0.701 0.838 0.760 0.917 [0.022] [0.063] [0.000] [0.218] 1.048 1.351 1.218 1.318 Sydney 0.752 0.759 0.767 0.908 [0.179] [0.009] [0.165] [0.495] 1.184 1.378 1.472 1.642 Las Vegas 0.772 0.834 0.808 1.043 [0.071] [0.020] [0.006] [0.076] This demonstrates that when weights are unusually high, users tend to express an opinion that does not conform to the net average of previous ratings. As we might expect, for a feature that rarely was a high weight in the discussion, (e.g., cleanliness) the difference is particularly large. Even though the difference in the feature Value is quite large for Sydney, the P-value is high. This is because only few reviews discussed value heavily. The reason could be cultural or because there was less of a reason to discuss this feature. 4.3 Reporting Incentives Previous models suggest that users who are not highly opinionated will not choose to voice their opinions [12]. In this section, we extend this model to account for the influence of expectations. The motivation for submitting feedback is not only due to extreme opinions, but also to the difference between the current reputation (i.e., the prior expectation of the user) and the actual experience. Such a rating model produces ratings that most of the time deviate from the current average rating. The ratings that confirm the prior expectation will rarely be submitted. We test on our data set the proportion of ratings that attempt to correct the current estimate. We define a deviant rating as one that deviates from the current expectation by at least some threshold θ, i.e., |ri f − ef (i)| ≥ θ. For each of the three considered cities, the following tables, show the proportion of deviant ratings for θ = 0.5 and θ = 1. Table 5: Proportion of deviant ratings with θ = 0.5 City O R S C V Boston 0.696 0.619 0.676 0.604 0.684 Sydney 0.645 0.615 0.672 0.614 0.675 Las Vegas 0.721 0.641 0.694 0.662 0.724 Table 6: Proportion of deviant ratings with θ = 1 City O R S C V Boston 0.420 0.397 0.429 0.317 0.446 Sydney 0.360 0.367 0.442 0.336 0.489 Las Vegas 0.510 0.421 0.483 0.390 0.472 The above results suggest that a large proportion of users (close to one half, even for the high threshold value θ = 1) deviate from the prior average. This reinforces the idea that users are more likely to submit a report when they believe they have something distinctive to add to the current stream of opinions for some feature. Such conclusions are in total agreement with prior evidence that the distribution of reports often follows bi-modal, U-shaped distributions. 139 5. MODELLING THE BEHAVIOR OF RATERS To account for the observations described in the previous sections, we propose a model for the behavior of the users when submitting online reviews. For a given hotel, we make the assumption that the quality experienced by the users is normally distributed around some value vf , which represents the objective quality offered by the hotel on the feature f. The rating submitted by user i on feature f is: ˆri f = δf vi f + (1 − δf ) · sign vi f − ef (i) c + d(vi f , ef (i)|wi f ) (2) where: • vi f is the (unknown) quality actually experienced by the user. vi f is assumed normally distributed around some value vf ; • δf ∈ [0, 1] can be seen as a measure of the bias when reporting feedback. High values reflect the fact that users rate objectively, without being influenced by prior expectations. The value of δf may depend on various factors; we fix one value for each feature f; • c is a constant between 1 and 5; • wi f is the weight of feature f in the textual comment of review i, computed according to Eq. (1); • d(vi f , ef (i)|wi f ) is a distance function between the expectation and the observation of user i. The distance function satisfies the following properties: - d(y, z|w) ≥ 0 for all y, z ∈ [0, 5], w ∈ [0, 1]; - |d(y, z|w)| < |d(z, x|w)| if |y − z| < |z − x|; - |d(y, z|w1)| < |d(y, z|w2)| if w1 < w2; - c + d(vf , ef (i)|wi f ) ∈ [1, 5]; The second term of Eq. (2) encodes the bias of the rating. The higher the distance between the true observation vi f and the function ef , the higher the bias. 5.1 Model Validation We use the data set of TripAdvisor reviews to validate the behavior model presented above. We split for convenience the rating values in three ranges: bad (B = {1, 2}), indifferent (I = {3, 4}), and good (G = {5}), and perform the following two tests: • First, we will use our model to predict the ratings that have extremal values. For every hotel, we take the sequence of reports, and whenever we encounter a rating that is either good or bad (but not indifferent) we try to predict it using Eq. (2) • Second, instead of predicting the value of extremal ratings, we try to classify them as either good or bad. For every hotel we take the sequence of reports, and for each report (regardless of it value) we classify it as being good or bad However, to perform these tests, we need to estimate the objective value, vf , that is the average of the true quality observations, vi f . The algorithm we are using is based on the intuition that the amount of conformity rating is minimized. In other words, the value vf should be such that as often as possible, bad ratings follow expectations above vf and good ratings follow expectations below vf . Formally, we define the sets: Γ1 = {i|ef (i) < vf and ri f ∈ B}; Γ2 = {i|ef (i) > vf and ri f ∈ G}; that correspond to irregularities where even though the expectation at point i is lower than the delivered value, the rating is poor, and vice versa. We define vf as the value that minimize these union of the two sets: vf = arg min vf |Γ1 ∪ Γ2| (3) In Eq. (2) we replace vi f by the value vf computed in Eq. (3), and use the following distance function: d(vf , ef (i)|wi f ) = |vf − ef (i)| vf − ef (i) |vf 2 − ef (i)2 | · (1 + 2wi f ); The constant c ∈ I was set to min{max{ef (i), 3}}, 4}. The values for δf were fixed at {0.7, 0.7, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6} for the features {Overall, Rooms, Service, Cleanliness, Value} respectively. The weights are computed as described in Section 3. As a first experiment, we take the sets of extremal ratings {ri f |ri f /∈ I} for each hotel and feature. For every such rating, ri f , we try to estimate it by computing ˆri f using Eq. (2). We compare this estimator with the one obtained by simply averaging the ratings over all hotels and features: i.e., ¯rf = j,r j f =0 rj f j,r j f =0 1 ; Table 7 presents the ratio between the root mean square error (RMSE) when using ˆri f and ¯rf to estimate the actual ratings. In all cases the estimate produced by our model is better than the simple average. Table 7: Average of RMSE(ˆrf ) RMSE(¯rf ) City O R S C V Boston 0.987 0.849 0.879 0.776 0.913 Sydney 0.927 0.817 0.826 0.720 0.681 Las Vegas 0.952 0.870 0.881 0.947 0.904 As a second experiment, we try to distinguish the sets Bf = {i|ri f ∈ B} and Gf = {i|ri f ∈ G} of bad, respectively good ratings on the feature f. For example, we compute the set Bf using the following classifier (called σ): ri f ∈ Bf (σf (i) = 1) ⇔ ˆri f ≤ 4; Tables 8, 9 and 10 present the Precision(p), Recall(r) and s = 2pr p+r for classifier σ, and compares it with a naive majority classifier, τ, τf (i) = 1 ⇔ |Bf | ≥ |Gf |: We see that recall is always higher for σ and precision is usually slightly worse. For the s metric σ tends to add a 140 Table 8: Precision(p), Recall(r), s= 2pr p+r while spotting poor ratings for Boston O R S C V p 0.678 0.670 0.573 0.545 0.610 σ r 0.626 0.659 0.619 0.612 0.694 s 0.651 0.665 0.595 0.577 0.609 p 0.684 0.706 0.647 0.611 0.633 τ r 0.597 0.541 0.410 0.383 0.562 s 0.638 0.613 0.502 0.471 0.595 Table 9: Precision(p), Recall(r), s= 2pr p+r while spotting poor ratings for Las Vegas O R S C V p 0.654 0.748 0.592 0.712 0.583 σ r 0.608 0.536 0.791 0.474 0.610 s 0.630 0.624 0.677 0.569 0.596 p 0.685 0.761 0.621 0.748 0.606 τ r 0.542 0.505 0.767 0.445 0.441 s 0.605 0.607 0.670 0.558 0.511 1-20% improvement over τ, much higher in some cases for hotels in Sydney. This is likely because Sydney reviews are more positive than those of the American cities and cases where the number of bad reviews exceeded the number of good ones are rare. Replacing the test algorithm with one that plays a 1 with probability equal to the proportion of bad reviews improves its results for this city, but it is still outperformed by around 80%. 6. SUMMARY OF RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The goal of this paper is to explore the factors that drive a user to submit a particular rating, rather than the incentives that encouraged him to submit a report in the first place. For that we use two additional sources of information besides the vector of numerical ratings: first we look at the textual comments that accompany the reviews, and second we consider the reports that have been previously submitted by other users. Using simple natural language processing algorithms, we were able to establish a correlation between the weight of a certain feature in the textual comment accompanying the review, and the noise present in the numerical rating. Specifically, it seems that users who discuss amply a certain feature are likely to agree on a common rating. This observation allows the construction of feature-by-feature estimators of quality that have a lower variance, and are hopefully less noisy. Nevertheless, further evidence is required to support the intuition that ratings corresponding to high weights are expert opinions that deserve to be given higher priority when computing estimates of quality. Second, we emphasize the dependence of ratings on previous reports. Previous reports create an expectation of quality which affects the subjective perception of the user. We validate two facts about the hotel reviews we collected from TripAdvisor: First, the ratings following low expectations (where the expectation is computed as the average of the previous reports) are likely to be higher than the ratings Table 10: Precision(p), Recall(r), s= 2pr p+r while spotting poor ratings for Sydney O R S C V p 0.650 0.463 0.544 0.550 0.580 σ r 0.234 0.378 0.571 0.169 0.592 s 0.343 0.452 0.557 0.259 0.586 p 0.562 0.615 0.600 0.500 0.600 τ r 0.054 0.098 0.101 0.015 0.175 s 0.098 0.168 0.172 0.030 0.271 following high expectations. Intuitively, the perception of quality (and consequently the rating) depends on how well the actual experience of the user meets her expectation. Second, we include evidence from the textual comments, and find that when users devote a large fraction of the text to discussing a certain feature, they are likely to motivate a divergent rating (i.e., a rating that does not conform to the prior expectation). Intuitively, this supports the hypothesis that review forums act as discussion groups where users are keen on presenting and motivating their own opinion. We have captured the empirical evidence in a behavior model that predicts the ratings submitted by the users. The final rating depends, as expected, on the true observation, and on the gap between the observation and the expectation. The gap tends to have a bigger influence when an important fraction of the textual comment is dedicated to discussing a certain feature. The proposed model was validated on the empirical data and provides better estimates of the ratings actually submitted. One assumption that we make is about the existence of an objective quality value vf for the feature f. This is rarely true, especially over large spans of time. Other explanations might account for the correlation of ratings with past reports. For example, if ef (i) reflects the true value of f at a point in time, the difference in the ratings following high and low expectations can be explained by hotel revenue models that are maximized when the value is modified accordingly. However, the idea that variation in ratings is not primarily a function of variation in value turns out to be a useful one. Our approach to approximate this elusive objective value is by no means perfect, but conforms neatly to the idea behind the model. A natural direction for future work is to examine concrete applications of our results. Significant improvements of quality estimates are likely to be obtained by incorporating all empirical evidence about rating behavior. Exactly how different factors affect the decisions of the users is not clear. The answer might depend on the particular application, context and culture. 7. REFERENCES [1] A. Admati and P.

El trabajo previo ha demostrado que los informes contradictorios y los sesgos subyacentes de los usuarios dificultan juzgar el verdadero valor de un servicio. En este documento, investigamos los factores subyacentes que influyen en el comportamiento del usuario al informar comentarios. Observamos dos fuentes de información además de las calificaciones numéricas: evidencia lingüística del comentario textual que acompaña a una revisión y patrones en la secuencia de tiempo de los informes. Primero mostramos que los grupos de usuarios que discuten ampliamente una determinada característica tienen más probabilidades de acordar una calificación común para esa característica. En segundo lugar, mostramos que una calificación de usuarios refleja en parte la diferencia entre la verdadera calidad y la expectativa previa de calidad a medida que se infiere de las revisiones anteriores. Ambos nos dan una forma menos ruidosa de producir estimaciones de calificación y revelar las razones detrás del sesgo del usuario. Nuestras hipótesis fueron validadas por evidencia estadística de revisiones de hoteles en el sitio web de TripAdvisor. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos J.4 [Ciencias Sociales y del Comportamiento]: Economía Términos generales Generales Economía, experimentación, confiabilidad 1. Motivaciones La propagación de Internet ha hecho posible que los foros de retroalimentación en línea (o mecanismos de reputación) se conviertan en un canal importante para el boca a boca con respecto a los productos, servicios u otros tipos de interacciones comerciales. Numerosos estudios empíricos [10, 15, 13, 5] muestran que los compradores consideran seriamente los comentarios en línea al tomar decisiones de compra y están dispuestos a pagar primas de reputación por productos o servicios que tienen una buena reputación. Sin embargo, un análisis reciente plantea preguntas importantes sobre la capacidad de los foros existentes para reflejar la calidad real de un producto. En ausencia de incentivos claros, los usuarios con una perspectiva moderada no se molestarán en expresar sus opiniones, lo que lleva a una muestra no representativa de revisiones. Por ejemplo, [12, 1] muestran que las calificaciones de Amazon1 de libros o CD siguen con una gran probabilidad de distribuciones bi-modales en forma de U donde la mayoría de las clasificaciones son muy buenas o muy malas. Los experimentos controlados, por otro lado, revelan opiniones sobre los mismos elementos que normalmente se distribuyen. En estas circunstancias, el uso de la media aritmética para predecir la calidad (como lo hacen la mayoría de los foros) le da al usuario típico un estimador con una alta varianza que a menudo es falsa. Mejorar la forma en que agregamos la información disponible de las revisiones en línea requiere una comprensión profunda de los factores subyacentes que sesgan el comportamiento de calificación de los usuarios. Hu et al.[12] propone el modelo de fanfjeamiento y moan donde los usuarios califican solo si su utilidad del producto (extraída de una distribución normal) cae fuera de un intervalo mediano. Los autores concluyen que el modelo explica la distribución empírica de los informes y ofrece información sobre formas más inteligentes de estimar la verdadera calidad del producto. En el presente documento, ampliamos esta línea de investigación e intentamos explicar más hechos sobre el comportamiento de los usuarios al informar comentarios en línea. Utilizando las revisiones de hotel reales del sitio web de TripAdvisor2, consideramos dos fuentes adicionales de información además de las calificaciones numéricas básicas enviadas por los usuarios. El primero es la evidencia lingüística simple de la revisión textual que generalmente acompaña las calificaciones numéricas. Utilizamos técnicas de minería de texto similares a [7] y [3], sin embargo, solo estamos interesados en identificar qué aspectos del servicio está discutiendo, sin calcular la orientación semántica del texto. Encontramos que los usuarios que comentan más sobre la misma característica tienen más probabilidades de acordar una calificación numérica común para esa característica en particular. Intuitivamente, los largos comentarios revelan la importancia de la característica para el usuario. Dado que las personas tienden a tener más conocimiento en los aspectos que consideran importantes, se puede suponer que los usuarios que discuten una característica dada en más detalles tienen más autoridad para evaluar esa característica. En segundo lugar, investigamos la relación entre una revisión 1 http://www.amazon.com 2 http://www.tripadvisor.com/ 134 Figura 1: La página de TripAdvisor que muestra reseñas para un popular hotel de Boston. El nombre del hotel y los anuncios se borró deliberativamente.y las revisiones que lo precedieron. Una lectura de las revisiones en línea muestra que las calificaciones a menudo son parte de los hilos de discusión, donde una publicación no es necesariamente independiente de otras publicaciones. Uno puede ver, por ejemplo, usuarios que hacen un esfuerzo para contradecir o estar con vehemencia con los comentarios de los usuarios anteriores. Al analizar la secuencia de tiempo de los informes, concluimos que las revisiones pasadas influyen en los informes futuros, ya que crean algunas expectativas previas con respecto a la calidad del servicio. La percepción subjetiva del usuario está influenciada por la brecha entre la expectativa previa y el rendimiento real del servicio [17, 18, 16, 21] que luego se reflejará en la calificación de los usuarios. Proponemos un modelo que captura la dependencia de las calificaciones de las expectativas previas y validamoslo utilizando los datos empíricos que recopilamos. Ambos resultados pueden usarse para mejorar la forma en que los mecanismos de reputación agregan la información de las revisiones individuales. Nuestro primer resultado se puede utilizar para determinar una estimación de la calidad de la característica de la calidad, donde para cada característica, se considera un subconjunto diferente de revisiones (es decir, aquellos con largos comentarios de esa característica). El segundo conduce a un algoritmo que genera una estimación más precisa de la calidad real.2. El conjunto de datos que utilizamos en este documento Real Hotel Reviews recopiladas del popular sitio de viajes TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor indexa hoteles de ciudades de todo el mundo, junto con revisiones escritas por viajeros. Los usuarios pueden buscar el sitio dando el nombre y la ubicación de los hoteles (opcional). Las reseñas para un hotel determinado se muestran como una lista (ordenada de la más reciente a la más antigua), con 5 reseñas por página. Las revisiones contienen: • Información sobre el autor de la revisión (por ejemplo, fechas de estadía, nombre de usuario del revisor, ubicación del revisor);• la calificación general (de 1, más baja, a 5, más alta);• Una revisión textual que contiene un título para la revisión, los comentarios gratuitos y las cosas principales que al revisor les gustó y no le gustaba;• Calificaciones numéricas (de 1, más bajas, 5, más altas) para diferentes características (por ejemplo, limpieza, servicio, ubicación, etc.) Debajo del nombre del hotel, TripAdvisor muestra la dirección del hotel, información general (número de habitaciones, número de estrellas, descripción corta, etc.), la calificación general promedio, la clasificación de TripAdvisor y una calificación promedio para cada característica. La Figura 1 muestra la página para un popular hotel de Boston cuyo nombre (junto con anuncios) se borró explícitamente. Seleccionamos tres ciudades para este estudio: Boston, Sydney y Las Vegas. Para cada ciudad consideramos todos los hoteles que tenían al menos 10 reseñas y registraron todas las críticas. La Tabla 1 presenta el número de hoteles considerados en cada ciudad, el número total de revisiones registradas para cada ciudad y la distribución de hoteles con respecto a la clasificación de estrellas (como está disponible en el sitio de TripAdvisor). Tenga en cuenta que no todos los hoteles tienen una calificación de estrellas. Tabla 1: Un resumen del conjunto de datos. Ciudad # Reseñas # Hoteles # de hoteles con 1,2,3,4 y 5 estrellas Boston 3993 58 1+3+17+15+2 Sydney 1371 47 0+0+9+13+10 Las Vegas 5593 40 0+3+10+9+6 Para cada revisión registramos la calificación general, la revisión textual (título y cuerpo de la revisión) y la calificación numérica en 7 características: habitaciones (R), servicio (s), limpieza (c), valor(V), comida (f), ubicación (l) y ruido (n). TripAdvisor no requiere que los usuarios envíen otra cosa que no sea la calificación general, por lo tanto, una revisión típica califica pocas características adicionales, independientemente de la discusión en el comentario textual. Solo las características de las habitaciones (R), el servicio (s), la limpieza (c) y el valor (v) son calificadas por un número significativo de usuarios. Sin embargo, también seleccionamos las características de alimentos (f), ubicación (l) y ruido (n) porque se hace referencia en un número significativo de comentarios textuales. Para cada característica grabamos la calificación numérica dada por el usuario, o 0 cuando falta la calificación. La longitud típica del comentario textual equivale a aproximadamente 200 palabras. Todos los datos se recopilaron arrastrando el sitio de TripAdvisor en septiembre de 2006. 2.1 Notación formal Nos referiremos formalmente a una revisión por una tupla (r, t) donde: • r = (rf) es un vector que contiene las calificaciones rf ∈ {0,1 ,...5} para las características f ∈ F = {O, R, S, C, V, F, L, N};Tenga en cuenta que la calificación general, RO, se registra abusivamente como la calificación de la característica general (O);• T es el comentario textual que acompaña a la revisión.135 revisiones se indexan de acuerdo con la variable I, de modo que (RI, TI) es la revisión IPI en nuestra base de datos. Como no grabamos el nombre de usuario del revisor, también diremos que la revisión del IPI en nuestro conjunto de datos fue enviado por el usuario I. Cuando necesitamos considerar solo las revisiones de un hotel determinado, h, usaremos (RI (H), TI (H)) para denotar la I -ésima revisión sobre el Hotel H.3. Evidencia de comentarios textuales Los comentarios textuales gratuitos asociados a las revisiones en línea son una valiosa fuente de información para comprender las razones detrás de las calificaciones numéricas dejadas por los revisores. El texto puede, por ejemplo, revelar ejemplos concretos de aspectos que al usuario le gustaban o no le gustaba, lo que justifica algunas de las calificaciones altas y respectivamente bajas para ciertas características. El texto también puede ofrecer pautas para comprender las preferencias del revisor y los pesos de diferentes características al calcular una calificación general. El problema, sin embargo, es que los comentarios textuales gratuitos son difíciles de leer. Los usuarios deben desplazarse a través de muchas revisiones y leer en su mayoría información repetitiva. Se obtendrían mejoras significativas si las revisiones se interpretaran automáticamente y se agregan. Desafortunadamente, esto parece una tarea difícil para las computadoras, ya que los usuarios humanos a menudo usan un lenguaje ingenioso, abreviaturas, frases culturales específicas y el estilo figurativo. Sin embargo, varios resultados importantes utilizan los comentarios textuales de las revisiones en línea de manera automatizada. El uso de técnicas de lenguaje natural bien establecidos, las revisiones o partes de las revisiones pueden clasificarse como una orientación semántica positiva o negativa. Pang et al.[2] Clasifique las reseñas de películas en positivo/negativo mediante el entrenamiento de tres clasificadores diferentes (Bayes ingenuos, entropía máxima y SVM) utilizando características de clasificación basadas en unigramas, bigrams o etiquetas de parte de voz. Dave et al.[4] Analice las revisiones de CNET y Amazon, y sorprendentemente muestran que las características de clasificación basadas en unigrams o BigRams funcionan mejor que los N-Grams de orden superior. Este resultado es desafiado por Cui et al.[3] quienes miran grandes colecciones de revisiones arrastradas de la web. Muestran que el tamaño del conjunto de datos es importante, y que los conjuntos de capacitación más grandes permiten a los clasificadores utilizar con éxito características de clasificación más complejas basadas en N-Grams. Hu y Liu [11] también rastrean la web para revisiones de productos e identifican automáticamente los atributos de productos que han sido discutidos por los revisores. Utilizan WordNet para calcular la orientación semántica de las evaluaciones de productos y resumen las revisiones de los usuarios al extraer evaluaciones positivas y negativas de diferentes características del producto. Popescu y Etzioni [20] analizan una configuración similar, pero usan los contados del motor de búsqueda para identificar los atributos del producto;La orientación semántica se asigna a través de la técnica de etiquetado de relajación. Ghose et al.[7, 8] Analice las revisiones de los vendedores del mercado secundario de Amazon para identificar las diferentes dimensiones (por ejemplo, entrega, embalaje, atención al cliente, etc.) de reputación. Analizan el texto y etiquetan la parte del discurso para cada palabra. Los sustantivos frecuentes, las frases de sustantivos y las frases verbales se identifican como dimensiones de reputación, mientras que los modificadores correspondientes (es decir, adjetivos y adverbios) se utilizan para obtener puntajes numéricos para cada dimensión. La medida de reputación mejorada se correlaciona mejor con la información de precios observada en el mercado. Pavlou y Dimoka [19] analizan las revisiones de eBay y encuentran que los comentarios textuales tienen un impacto importante en las primas de reputación. Nuestro enfoque es similar a las obras mencionadas anteriormente, en el sentido de que identificamos los aspectos (es decir, las características del hotel) discutidos por los usuarios en las revisiones textuales. Sin embargo, no calculamos la orientación semántica del texto, ni intentamos inferir las calificaciones faltantes. Definimos el peso, Wi F, de la característica f ∈ F en el texto Ti asociado con la revisión (RI, TI), como la fracción de Ti dedicada a discutir aspectos (tanto positivos como negativos) relacionados con la característica f.Proponemos un método elemental para aproximar los valores de estos pesos. Para cada característica, construimos manualmente la lista de palabras LF que contiene aproximadamente 50 palabras que se asocian más comúnmente a la característica F.Las palabras iniciales se seleccionaron al leer algunas de las revisiones y ver qué palabras coinciden con la discusión de qué características. La lista se extendió luego agregando todas las entradas de tesauro que estaban relacionadas con las palabras iniciales. Finalmente, hicimos una lluvia de ideas para palabras faltantes que normalmente se asociarían con cada una de las características. Deje que LF ∩ti sea la lista de términos comunes a LF y TI. Cada término de LF se cuenta el número de veces que aparece en TI, con dos excepciones: • En los casos en que el usuario envía un título a la revisión, contabilizamos el texto del título al agregarlo tres veces al texto de revisión TI. La suposición intuitiva es que la opinión de los usuarios se refleja más fuertemente en el título, más que en el cuerpo de la revisión. Por ejemplo, muchas revisiones se resumen con precisión por títulos como un excelente servicio, ubicación terrible o mal valor por dinero;• Ciertas palabras que ocurren solo una vez en el texto se cuentan varias veces si su relevancia para esa característica es particularmente fuerte. Estas fueron palabras raíz para cada característica (por ejemplo, el personal es una palabra raíz para el servicio de características), y se ponderó 2 o 3. Cada característica se asignó hasta 3 palabras raíz de esas, por lo que casi todas las palabras se cuentan solo una vez. La lista de palabras para las salas de características se da como referencia en el Apéndice A. El peso wi f se calcula como: wi f = | lf ∩ ti |f∈F | lf ∩ ti |(1) donde | lf ∩ti |es el número de términos comunes a LF y TI. El peso para la función en general se estableció en min {| t i |5000, 1} donde | Ti |es el número de carácter en ti. La siguiente es una revisión de TripAdvisor para un hotel de Boston (se omite el nombre del hotel): Comenzaré diciendo que soy más una persona de vacaciones que un tipo ***. Así que me siento frustrado cuando pago el doble de la tarifa de la habitación y obtengo la mitad de las comodidades que tengo en Hampton Inn o Holiday Inn. La ubicación fue definitivamente el activo principal de este lugar. Estaba a solo unas pocas cuadras de la parada del metro del Centro Hynes y fue fácil caminar a algunos buenos restaurantes en el área de la bahía. Boylston no está muy lejos. Así que no tuve problemas para renunciar a un auto de alquiler y llevar el metro desde el aeropuerto al hotel y usar el metro para cualquier otro viaje. De lo contrario, te hacen pagar cualquier cosa y todo.136 Y cuando ya haya caído $ 215/noche en la habitación, eso se vuelve frustrante. La habitación en sí era decente, sobre lo que esperaría. El personal también era promedio, no malo y no excelente. Nuevamente, creo que estás pagando por la ubicación y la capacidad de caminar a muchas cosas buenas. Pero creo que la próxima vez me quedaré en Brookline, obtendré más comodidades y usaré el metro un poco más. Estas calificaciones numéricas asociadas a esta revisión son RO = 3, RR = 3, RS = 3, RC = 4, RV = 2 para características en general (O), habitaciones (R), servicio (s), limpieza (c) y valor(V) respectivamente. Las clasificaciones para las características de los alimentos (F), la ubicación (L) y el ruido (n) están ausentes (es decir, RF = RL = RN = 0). Los pesos WF se calculan a partir de las siguientes listas de términos comunes: lr ∩ t = {habitación};wr = 0.066 ls ∩ t = {3 * personal, comodidades};ws = 0.267 lc ∩ t = ∅;wc = 0 lv ∩ t = {$, tasa};wv = 0.133 lf ∩ t = {restaurante};wf = 0.067 ll ∩ t = {2 * centro, 2 * caminata, 2 * ubicación, área};wl = 0.467 ln ∩ t = ∅;Wn = 0 Las palabras raíz y el centro se triplicaron y duplicaron respectivamente. El peso total de la revisión textual es WO = 0.197. Estos valores explican razonablemente bien para los pesos de diferentes características en la discusión del revisor. Un punto a tener en cuenta es que algunos términos en las listas LF poseen una orientación semántica inherente. Por ejemplo, la palabra mugre (perteneciente a la lista LC) se usaría con mayor frecuencia para afirmar la presencia, y no la ausencia de mugre. Esto es inevitable, pero se tuvo cuidado para garantizar que se utilizaran palabras de ambos lados del espectro. Por esta razón, algunas listas como LR contienen solo sustantivos de objetos que típicamente uno describiría en una habitación (ver Apéndice A). El objetivo de esta sección es analizar la influencia de los pesos con las calificaciones numéricas Ri f. Intuitivamente, los usuarios que pasaron mucho tiempo discutiendo una característica F (es decir, WI F es alta) tenían algo que decir sobre su experiencia con respecto a esta característica. Obviamente, la característica F es importante para el usuario i. Dado que las personas tienden a tener más conocimientos en los aspectos que consideran importantes, nuestra hipótesis es que las calificaciones Ri F (correspondientes a los altos pesos WI F) constituyen un subconjunto de calificaciones expertas para la característica f.La Figura 2 traza la distribución de las tarifas R I (H) C con respecto a los pesos W (H) C para la limpieza de un hotel Las Vegas, h.Aquí, las altas calificaciones están restringidas a las revisiones que discuten poco la limpieza. Cada vez que aparece la limpieza en la discusión, las calificaciones son bajas. Muchos hoteles exhiben patrones de calificación similares para diversas características. Las clasificaciones correspondientes a pesos bajos abarcan todo el espectro de 1 a 5, mientras que las clasificaciones correspondientes a pesos altos están más agrupados (ya sea alrededor de las calificaciones buenas o malas). Por lo tanto, hacemos la siguiente hipótesis: Hipótesis 1. Las calificaciones RI F correspondientes a las revisiones donde WI F es altas, son más similares entre sí que a la colección general de calificaciones. Para probar la hipótesis, tomamos todo el conjunto de revisiones y característica por característica, calculamos la desviación estándar de las calificaciones con altos pesos y la desviación estándar de todo el conjunto de calificaciones. Los pesos altos se definieron como los que pertenecen al 20% superior del rango de peso para la característica correspondiente. Si la hipótesis 1 fuera cierta, la desviación estándar de todas las clasificaciones debería ser mayor que la desviación estándar de las clasificaciones con altos pesos.0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 Peso de calificación Figura 2: La distribución de clasificaciones contra el peso de la función de limpieza. Utilizamos una prueba t estándar para medir la importancia de los resultados. Ciudad por ciudad y característica por característica, la Tabla 2 presenta la desviación estándar promedio de todas las calificaciones y la desviación estándar promedio de las calificaciones con altos pesos. De hecho, las calificaciones con pesos altos tienen una desviación estándar más baja, y los resultados son significativos en el umbral de significancia de 0.05 estándar (aunque para ciertas ciudades tomadas independientemente no parece haber una diferencia significativa, los resultados son significativos para todo el conjunto de datos). Tenga en cuenta que solo se consideraron las características O, R, S, C y V, ya que para los demás (F, L y N) no teníamos suficientes calificaciones.

Podemos, por ejemplo, construir una estimación de calidad característica por función con una varianza mucho más baja: para cada característica tomamos el subconjunto de revisiones que discuten ampliamente esa característica y la salida como una estimación de calidad de la calificación promedio para este subconjunto. Los experimentos iniciales sugieren que las clasificaciones promedio de características por funciones calculadas de esta manera son diferentes de las clasificaciones promedio calculadas en todo el conjunto de datos. Dado que, de hecho, los pesos altos son indicadores de opiniones de expertos, las estimaciones obtenidas de esta manera son más precisas que las actuales. Sin embargo, la validación de esta suposición subyacente requiere más experimentos controlados.137 4. La influencia de las calificaciones pasadas se realizan dos suposiciones importantes sobre las revisiones presentadas a foros en línea. La primera es que las calificaciones reflejan sinceramente la calidad observada por los usuarios;El segundo es que las revisiones son independientes entre sí. Mientras que la evidencia anecdótica [9, 22] desafía la primera suposición3, en esta sección, nos dirigimos a la segunda. Una lectura de las revisiones en línea muestra que las revisiones a menudo son parte de los hilos de discusión, donde los usuarios hacen un esfuerzo por contradecir, o de acuerdo con el acuerdo con las observaciones de los usuarios anteriores. Considere, por ejemplo, la siguiente revisión: no entiendo las críticas negativas ... el hotel estaba un poco oscuro, pero ese era el estilo. Fue muy artístico. Sí, estaba cerca de la autopista, pero en mi opinión, ¡el sonido de un auto ruidoso ocasional es mejor que escuchar el ding de máquinas tragamonedas toda la noche! El personal disponible es fabuloso. Las camareras son geniales (y *** no merece la mala crítica que recibió, ¡estaba 100% atenta a nosotros!), Los camareros son amigables y profesionales al mismo tiempo ... Aquí, el usuario fue perturbado por informes negativos anteriores, abordó estas preocupaciones y se puso a tratar de corregirlas. No es sorprendente que sus calificaciones fueron considerablemente más altas que las calificaciones promedio hasta este punto. Parece que los usuarios de TripAdvisor leen regularmente los informes enviados por usuarios anteriores antes de reservar un hotel o antes de escribir una reseña. Las revisiones anteriores crean algunas expectativas previas con respecto a la calidad del servicio, y esta expectativa influye en la revisión presentada. Creemos que esta observación se mantiene para la mayoría de los foros en línea. La percepción subjetiva de la calidad es directamente proporcional a qué tan bien la experiencia real cumple con la expectativa previa, un hecho confirmado por una importante línea de investigación econométrica y de comercialización [17, 18, 16, 21]. La correlación entre las revisiones también ha sido confirmada por investigaciones recientes sobre la dinámica de los foros de revisión en línea [6].4.1 Expectativas previas definimos la expectativa previa del usuario I con respecto a la característica F, como el promedio de las calificaciones disponibles anteriormente en la función F4: EF (I) = J <I, R J F = 0 RJ F J <I, R J F = 0 1Como primera hipótesis, afirmamos que la calificación Ri F es una función de la expectativa previa EF (I): Hipótesis 2. Para un hotel y una característica determinada, dadas las reseñas I y J de tal manera que EF (i) es alto y EF (J) es bajo, la calificación RJ F excede la calificación Ri f. Definimos expectativas altas y bajas como las anteriores, respectivamente por debajo de un cierto valor de corte θ. El conjunto de reseñas precedidas por las altas, respectivamente bajas expectativas, 3 parte de las reseñas de Amazon fueron reconocidas como publicaciones estratégicas por autores o competidores de libros 4 Si no se asignaron calificaciones anteriores para la característica F, EF (i) se le asigna un valor predeterminado de 4. Tabla 3: Calificaciones promedio para revisiones precedidas por las expectativas de bajo (primer valor en la celda) y alto (segundo valor en la celda). Los valores P para una diferencia positiva se dan entre paréntesis cuadrados.

Este valor bastante alto está cerca de la calificación promedio en todas las características en todos los hoteles, y está justificado por el hecho de que nuestro conjunto de datos contiene en su mayoría hoteles de alta calidad. Para cada ciudad, tomamos todos los hoteles y calculamos las clasificaciones promedio en los conjuntos Rhigh F y Rlow F (ver Tabla 3). La calificación promedio entre revisiones después de bajas expectativas anteriores es significativamente más alta que la calificación promedio después de las altas expectativas. Como evidencia adicional, consideramos todos los hoteles para los cuales la función EV (i) (la expectativa para el valor de la característica) tiene un valor alto (mayor que 4) para algunos I, y un valor bajo (menos de 4) para otros i. Intuitivamente, estos son los hoteles para los cuales hay un grado mínimo de variación en la secuencia oportuna de revisiones: es decir, el promedio acumulativo de las calificaciones fue en algún momento de alto y luego se volvió baja, o viceversa. Dichas variaciones se observan durante aproximadamente la mitad de todos los hoteles en cada ciudad. La Figura 3 traza la calificación de la mediana (en hoteles considerados), RV, cuando EF (I) no es más que x sino mayor que x - 0.5.2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 Expectativa de medalofrado Boston Sydney Vegas Figura 3: Las clasificaciones tienden a disminuir a medida que aumenta la expectativa.138 Hay dos formas de interpretar la función EF (i): • El valor esperado para la característica F obtenido por el usuario I antes de su experiencia con el servicio, adquirido por los informes de lectura enviados por usuarios anteriores. En este caso, un valor demasiado alto para EF (i) impulsaría al usuario a enviar un informe negativo (o viceversa), derivado de la diferencia entre el valor real del servicio y la expectativa inflada de este valor adquirido antes de suexperiencia.• El valor esperado de la característica F para todos los visitantes posteriores del Sitio, si el usuario no debía enviar un informe. En este caso, la motivación para un informe negativo que sigue a un valor demasiado alto de EF es diferente: el usuario I busca corregir la expectativa de futuros visitantes al sitio. A diferencia de la interpretación anterior, esto no requiere que el usuario obtenga una expectativa a priori para el valor de f.Tenga en cuenta que ninguna de las interpretaciones implica que el promedio del informe I está inversamente relacionado con la calificación en el informe i. Puede existir una medida de influencia ejercida por informes anteriores que empuja al usuario detrás del Informe I para enviar calificaciones que, en cierta medida, se ajusta a los informes pasados: un valor bajo para EF (i) puede influir en el usuario I para enviar una calificación baja para la característica FPorque, por ejemplo, teme que presentar una calificación alta lo hará ser una persona con bajos estándares5. Esto, al principio, parece contradecir la Hipótesis 2. Sin embargo, esta calificación de conformidad no puede continuar indefinidamente: una vez que el conjunto de informes proyecte una estimación suficientemente desinflada para la FV, los revisores futuros con impresiones relativamente positivas buscarán corregir este error.4.2 Impacto de los comentarios textuales sobre la expectativa de calidad Se puede obtener más información sobre el comportamiento de calificación de los usuarios de TripAdvisor analizando la relación entre los pesos WF y los valores EF (I). En particular, examinamos la siguiente hipótesis: Hipótesis 3. Cuando una gran proporción del texto de una revisión discute una determinada característica, la diferencia entre la calificación para esa característica y la calificación promedio hasta ese punto tiende a ser grande. La intuición detrás de esta afirmación es que cuando el usuario es inflexible en expresar su opinión con respecto a una cierta característica, su opinión difiere de la opinión colectiva de las publicaciones anteriores. Esto se basa en la característica de los sistemas de reputación como foros de retroalimentación en los que un usuario está interesado en proyectar su opinión, con una fuerza particular si esta opinión difiere de lo que él percibe como la opinión general. Para probar la Hipótesis 3, medimos la diferencia absoluta promedio entre la expectativa EF (I) y la Ri F de calificación cuando el peso WI F es alto, respectivamente bajo. Los pesos se clasifican altos o bajos comparándolos con ciertos valores de corte: Wi F es bajo si es menor que 0.1, mientras que Wi F es alto si es mayor que θf. Se usaron diferentes valores de corte para diferentes características: θr = 0.4, θs = 0.4, θc = 0.2 y θv = 0.7. La limpieza tiene un corte más bajo, ya que se trata de una característica rara vez discutida;El valor tiene un alto límite por la razón opuesta. Los resultados se presentan en la Tabla 4. 5 La idea de que los informes negativos pueden fomentar más informes negativos se han sugerido antes [14] Tabla 4: promedio de | ri f −Ef (i) |Cuando los pesos son altos (primer valor en la celda) y bajo (segundo valor en la celda) con valores p para la diferencia en los soportes Sq.

Como es de esperar, para una característica que rara vez era un alto peso en la discusión (por ejemplo, la limpieza) la diferencia es particularmente grande. Aunque la diferencia en el valor de la característica es bastante grande para Sydney, el valor p es alta. Esto se debe a que solo unas pocas revisiones discutieron en gran medida. La razón podría ser cultural o porque había menos razón para discutir esta característica.4.3 Incentivos de informes Los modelos anteriores sugieren que los usuarios que no son muy obstinados no elegirán expresar sus opiniones [12]. En esta sección, ampliamos este modelo para tener en cuenta la influencia de las expectativas. La motivación para enviar comentarios no solo se debe a opiniones extremas, sino también a la diferencia entre la reputación actual (es decir, la expectativa previa del usuario) y la experiencia real. Tal modelo de calificación produce clasificaciones que la mayoría de las veces se desvían de la calificación promedio actual. Las calificaciones que confirman las expectativas anteriores rara vez se presentarán. Probamos en nuestro conjunto de datos la proporción de calificaciones que intentan corregir la estimación actual. Definimos una calificación desviada como una que se desvía de la expectativa actual por al menos algún umbral θ, es decir, | ri f - ef (i) |≥ θ. Para cada una de las tres ciudades consideradas, las siguientes tablas, muestran la proporción de calificaciones desviadas para θ = 0.5 y θ = 1. Tabla 5: Proporción de clasificaciones desviadas con θ = 0.5 Ciudad O R S C V Boston 0.696 0.619 0.676 0.604 0.684 Sydney 0.645 0.615 0.672 0.614 0.675 Las Vegas 0.721 0.641 0.694 0.662 0.724 Tabla 6: proporción de calificaciones de θ 429 0.3170.446 Sydney 0.360 0.367 0.442 0.336 0.489 Las Vegas 0.510 0.421 0.483 0.390 0.472 Los resultados anteriores sugieren que una gran proporción de usuarios (cerca de la mitad, incluso para el valor de umbral alto θ = 1) se desvía del promedio anterior. Esto refuerza la idea de que es más probable que los usuarios envíen un informe cuando creen que tienen algo distintivo para agregar al flujo actual de opiniones para alguna característica. Dichas conclusiones están de acuerdo total con evidencia previa de que la distribución de informes a menudo sigue distribuciones bi-modales en forma de U.139 5. Modelando el comportamiento de los evaluadores para tener en cuenta las observaciones descritas en las secciones anteriores, proponemos un modelo para el comportamiento de los usuarios al enviar revisiones en línea. Para un hotel determinado, suponemos que la calidad experimentada por los usuarios normalmente se distribuye en torno a algún valor VF, lo que representa la calidad del objetivo que ofrece el hotel en la función f.La calificación presentada por el usuario I en la característica F es: ˆri F = ΔF VI F + (1 - ΔF) · Sign VI F - EF (I) C + D (VI F, EF (I) | WI F) (2)Dónde: • VI F es la calidad (desconocida) realmente experimentada por el usuario.VI F se supone normalmente distribuido alrededor de algún valor VF;• ΔF ∈ [0, 1] puede verse como una medida del sesgo al informar la retroalimentación. Los valores altos reflejan el hecho de que los usuarios califican objetivamente, sin ser influenciados por las expectativas previas. El valor de ΔF puede depender de varios factores;arreglamos un valor para cada característica F;• C es una constante entre 1 y 5;• Wi F es el peso de la característica F en el comentario textual de la revisión I, calculado según la ecuación.(1);• D (VI F, EF (I) | Wi F) es una función de distancia entre la expectativa y la observación del usuario i. La función de distancia satisface las siguientes propiedades: - d (y, z | w) ≥ 0 para todas y, z ∈ [0, 5], w ∈ [0, 1];- | d (y, z | w) |<| d (z, x | w) |Si | y - z |<| z - x |;- | d (y, z | w1) |<| d (y, z | w2) |Si w1 <w2;- c + d (vf, ef (i) | wi f) ∈ [1, 5];El segundo término de la ecuación.(2) codifica el sesgo de la calificación. Cuanto mayor sea la distancia entre la verdadera observación VI F y la función EF, mayor será el sesgo.5.1 Validación del modelo Utilizamos el conjunto de datos de revisiones de TripAdvisor para validar el modelo de comportamiento presentado anteriormente. Dividimos por conveniencia los valores de calificación en tres rangos: mal (b = {1, 2}), indiferente (i = {3, 4}) y bueno (g = {5}), y realiza las siguientes dos pruebas:• Primero, usaremos nuestro modelo para predecir las calificaciones que tienen valores extremos. Para cada hotel, tomamos la secuencia de informes, y cada vez que encontramos una calificación que sea buena o mala (pero no indiferente) intentamos predecirlo usando la ecuación.(2) • Segundo, en lugar de predecir el valor de las calificaciones extremas, intentamos clasificarlas como buenas o malas. Para cada hotel, tomamos la secuencia de informes, y para cada informe (independientemente de su valor de TI) lo clasificamos como bueno o malo, sin embargo, para realizar estas pruebas, necesitamos estimar el valor objetivo, VF, que es el promedio deLas verdaderas observaciones de calidad, vi f. El algoritmo que estamos utilizando se basa en la intuición de que se minimiza la cantidad de calificación de conformidad. En otras palabras, el valor VF debe ser tal que con la frecuencia posible, las calificaciones malas siguen las expectativas por encima de la FV y las buenas calificaciones siguen las expectativas por debajo de VF. Formalmente, definimos los conjuntos: γ1 = {i | ef (i) <vf y ri f ∈ B};Γ2 = {i | ef (i)> vf y ri f ∈ G};que corresponden a irregularidades donde, aunque la expectativa en el punto I es más baja que el valor entregado, la calificación es pobre y viceversa. Definimos VF como el valor que minimiza estas uniones de los dos conjuntos: Vf = arg min vf | γ1 ∪ γ2 |(3) En la ecuación.(2) Reemplazamos VI F por el valor VF calculado en la ecuación.(3), y use la siguiente función de distancia: d (vf, ef (i) | wi f) = | vf - ef (i) |vf - ef (i) | vf 2 - ef (i) 2 |· (1 + 2wi f);La constante c ∈ I se estableció en min {max {ef (i), 3}}, 4}. Los valores para ΔF se fijaron en {0.7, 0.7, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6} para las características {en general, habitaciones, servicio, limpieza, valor} respectivamente. Los pesos se calculan como se describe en la Sección 3. Como primer experimento, tomamos los conjuntos de clasificaciones extremas {ri f | ri f /∈ I} para cada hotel y característica. Para cada calificación, ri f, intentamos estimarlo calculando ˆri f usando la ecuación.(2). Comparamos este estimador con el obtenido simplemente promediando las clasificaciones sobre todos los hoteles y características: es decir, ¯rf = j, r j f = 0 rj f j, r j f = 0 1;La Tabla 7 presenta la relación entre el error cuadrado medio de la raíz (RMSE) cuando se usa ˆri F y ¯RF para estimar las calificaciones reales. En todos los casos, la estimación producida por nuestro modelo es mejor que el promedio simple. Tabla 7: Promedio de RMSE (ˆRF) RMSE (¯RF) Ciudad O R S C V Boston 0.987 0.849 0.879 0.776 0.913 Sydney 0.927 0.817 0.826 0.720 0.681 LAS Vegas 0.952 0.870 0.881 0.947 0.904 Como un segundo experimento, lo que intentaremos para intentarlo, lo que intentará para intentarlo, por lo que intentará hacerlo.| ri f ∈ B} y gf = {i | ri f ∈ G} de calificaciones malas, respectivamente buenas en la característica f.Por ejemplo, calculamos el conjunto BF usando el siguiente clasificador (llamado σ): ri f ∈ Bf (σf (i) = 1) ⇔ ˆri f ≤ 4;Las tablas 8, 9 y 10 presentan la precisión (p), recuerdo (r) y s = 2pr p+r para clasificador σ, y lo compara con un clasificador mayoritario ingenuo, τ, τf (i) = 1 ⇔ | bf |≥ | GF |: Vemos que el retiro siempre es más alto para σ y la precisión suele ser ligeramente peor.

Esto es probable porque las revisiones de Sydney son más positivas que las de las ciudades y casos estadounidenses en los que el número de malas revisiones excedió el número de buenas son raras. Reemplazar el algoritmo de prueba con uno que juega un 1 con probabilidad igual a la proporción de malas revisiones mejora sus resultados para esta ciudad, pero todavía tiene un rendimiento superado en alrededor del 80%.6. Resumen de los resultados y la conclusión El objetivo de este documento es explorar los factores que impulsan a un usuario a enviar una calificación particular, en lugar de los incentivos que lo alentaron a presentar un informe en primer lugar. Para eso, usamos dos fuentes adicionales de información además del vector de las calificaciones numéricas: primero observamos los comentarios textuales que acompañan las revisiones, y segundo consideramos los informes que otros usuarios han presentado previamente. Utilizando algoritmos simples de procesamiento del lenguaje natural, pudimos establecer una correlación entre el peso de una determinada característica en el comentario textual que acompaña a la revisión y el ruido presente en la calificación numérica. Específicamente, parece que los usuarios que discuten ampliamente una determinada característica es probable que acuerden una calificación común. Esta observación permite la construcción de estimadores de calidad característicos por funciones que tienen una varianza más baja y, con suerte, son menos ruidosos. Sin embargo, se requiere más evidencia para respaldar la intuición de que las calificaciones correspondientes a los altos pesos son opiniones de expertos que merecen tener una mayor prioridad al calcular las estimaciones de calidad. En segundo lugar, enfatizamos la dependencia de las calificaciones en informes anteriores. Informes anteriores crean una expectativa de calidad que afecta la percepción subjetiva del usuario. Validamos dos hechos sobre las reseñas del hotel que recolectamos de TripAdvisor: primero, las calificaciones que siguen las bajas expectativas (donde la expectativa se calcula como el promedio de los informes anteriores) es probable que sean más altas que las clasificaciones Tabla 10: Precisión (P),Recuerde (R), S = 2PR P+R Mientras observa las calificaciones pobres para Sydney o R S C V P 0.650 0.463 0.544 0.550 0.580 σ R 0.234 0.378 0.571 0.169 0.592 S 0.343 0.452 0.557 0.259 0.586 P 0.562 0.615 0.600 0.500 0.343 0.452 0.557 0.259. 15 0.175S 0.098 0.168 0.172 0.030 0.271 después de altas expectativas. Intuitivamente, la percepción de calidad (y, en consecuencia, la calificación) depende de qué tan bien la experiencia real del usuario cumpla con sus expectativas. En segundo lugar, incluimos evidencia de los comentarios textuales, y encontramos que cuando los usuarios dedican una gran fracción del texto a discutir una determinada característica, es probable que motiven una calificación divergente (es decir, una calificación que no se ajusta a la expectativa previa). Intuitivamente, esto respalda la hipótesis de que los foros de revisión actúan como grupos de discusión donde los usuarios están interesados en presentar y motivar su propia opinión. Hemos capturado la evidencia empírica en un modelo de comportamiento que predice las calificaciones presentadas por los usuarios. La calificación final depende, como se esperaba, en la verdadera observación y de la brecha entre la observación y la expectativa. La brecha tiende a tener una mayor influencia cuando una fracción importante del comentario textual se dedica a discutir una determinada característica. El modelo propuesto se validó en los datos empíricos y proporciona mejores estimaciones de las calificaciones realmente presentadas. Una suposición que hacemos es sobre la existencia de un valor de calidad objetivo VF para la característica F.Esto rara vez es cierto, especialmente en grandes tramos de tiempo. Otras explicaciones podrían explicar la correlación de las calificaciones con informes anteriores. Por ejemplo, si EF (i) refleja el valor verdadero de F en un punto en el tiempo, la diferencia en las calificaciones después de las expectativas altas y bajas puede explicarse por los modelos de ingresos del hotel que se maximizan cuando el valor se modifica en consecuencia. Sin embargo, la idea de que la variación en las calificaciones no es principalmente una función de la variación en el valor resulta ser útil. Nuestro enfoque para aproximar este valor de objetivo evasivo no es de ninguna manera perfecto, pero se ajusta perfectamente a la idea detrás del modelo. Una dirección natural para el trabajo futuro es examinar las aplicaciones concretas de nuestros resultados. Es probable que se obtengan mejoras significativas de las estimaciones de calidad incorporando todas las pruebas empíricas sobre el comportamiento de calificación. No está claro cómo los diferentes factores afectan las decisiones de los usuarios. La respuesta puede depender de la aplicación, el contexto y la cultura particular.7. Referencias [1] A. admati y P.

        "Previous work has demonstrated that contradictory reporting and underlying user biases make judging the true worth of a service difficult.",
        "In this paper, we investigate underlying factors that influence user behavior when reporting feedback.",
        "We look at two sources of information besides numerical ratings: linguistic evidence from the textual comment accompanying a review, and patterns in the time sequence of reports.",
        "We first show that groups of users who amply discuss a certain feature are more likely to agree on a common rating for that feature.",
        "Second, we show that a users rating partly reflects the difference between true quality and prior expectation of quality as inferred from previous reviews.",
        "Both give us a less noisy way to produce rating estimates and reveal the reasons behind user bias.",
        "Our hypotheses were validated by statistical evidence from hotel reviews on the TripAdvisor website.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Social and Behavioral Sciences]: Economics General Terms Economics, Experimentation, Reliability 1.",
        "MOTIVATIONS The spread of the internet has made it possible for online feedback forums (or reputation mechanisms) to become an important channel for Word-of-mouth regarding products, services or other types of commercial interactions.",
        "Numerous empirical studies [10, 15, 13, 5] show that buyers seriously consider online feedback when making purchasing decisions, and are willing to pay reputation premiums for products or services that have a good reputation.",
        "Recent analysis, however, raises important questions regarding the ability of existing forums to reflect the real quality of a product.",
        "In the absence of clear incentives, users with a moderate outlook will not bother to voice their opinions, which leads to an unrepresentative sample of reviews.",
        "For example, [12, 1] show that Amazon1 ratings of books or CDs follow with great probability bi-modal, U-shaped distributions where most of the ratings are either very good, or very bad.",
        "Controlled experiments, on the other hand, reveal opinions on the same items that are normally distributed.",
        "Under these circumstances, using the arithmetic mean to predict quality (as most forums actually do) gives the typical user an estimator with high variance that is often false.",
        "Improving the way we aggregate the information available from online reviews requires a deep understanding of the underlying factors that bias the rating behavior of users.",
        "Hu et al. [12] propose the Brag-and-Moan Model where users rate only if their utility of the product (drawn from a normal distribution) falls outside a median interval.",
        "The authors conclude that the model explains the empirical distribution of reports, and offers insights into smarter ways of estimating the true quality of the product.",
        "In the present paper we extend this line of research, and attempt to explain further facts about the behavior of users when reporting online feedback.",
        "Using actual hotel reviews from the TripAdvisor2 website, we consider two additional sources of information besides the basic numerical ratings submitted by users.",
        "The first is simple linguistic evidence from the textual review that usually accompanies the numerical ratings.",
        "We use text-mining techniques similar to [7] and [3], however, we are only interested in identifying what aspects of the service the user is discussing, without computing the semantic orientation of the text.",
        "We find that users who comment more on the same feature are more likely to agree on a common numerical rating for that particular feature.",
        "Intuitively, lengthy comments reveal the importance of the feature to the user.",
        "Since people tend to be more knowledgeable in the aspects they consider important, users who discuss a given feature in more details might be assumed to have more authority in evaluating that feature.",
        "Second we investigate the relationship between a review 1 http://www.amazon.com 2 http://www.tripadvisor.com/ 134 Figure 1: The TripAdvisor page displaying reviews for a popular Boston hotel.",
        "Name of hotel and advertisements were deliberatively erased. and the reviews that preceded it.",
        "A perusal of online reviews shows that ratings are often part of discussion threads, where one post is not necessarily independent of other posts.",
        "One may see, for example, users who make an effort to contradict, or vehemently agree with, the remarks of previous users.",
        "By analyzing the time sequence of reports, we conclude that past reviews influence the future reports, as they create some prior expectation regarding the quality of service.",
        "The subjective perception of the user is influenced by the gap between the prior expectation and the actual performance of the service [17, 18, 16, 21] which will later reflect in the users rating.",
        "We propose a model that captures the dependence of ratings on prior expectations, and validate it using the empirical data we collected.",
        "Both results can be used to improve the way reputation mechanisms aggregate the information from individual reviews.",
        "Our first result can be used to determine a featureby-feature estimate of quality, where for each feature, a different subset of reviews (i.e., those with lengthy comments of that feature) is considered.",
        "The second leads to an algorithm that outputs a more precise estimate of the real quality. 2.",
        "THE DATA SET We use in this paper real hotel reviews collected from the popular travel site TripAdvisor.",
        "TripAdvisor indexes hotels from cities across the world, along with reviews written by travelers.",
        "Users can search the site by giving the hotels name and location (optional).",
        "The reviews for a given hotel are displayed as a list (ordered from the most recent to the oldest), with 5 reviews per page.",
        "The reviews contain: • information about the author of the review (e.g., dates of stay, username of the reviewer, location of the reviewer); • the overall rating (from 1, lowest, to 5, highest); • a textual review containing a title for the review, free comments, and the main things the reviewer liked and disliked; • numerical ratings (from 1, lowest, to 5, highest) for different features (e.g., cleanliness, service, location, etc.)",
        "Below the name of the hotel, TripAdvisor displays the address of the hotel, general information (number of rooms, number of stars, short description, etc), the average overall rating, the TripAdvisor ranking, and an average rating for each feature.",
        "Figure 1 shows the page for a popular Boston hotel whose name (along with advertisements) was explicitly erased.",
        "We selected three cities for this study: Boston, Sydney and Las Vegas.",
        "For each city we considered all hotels that had at least 10 reviews, and recorded all reviews.",
        "Table 1 presents the number of hotels considered in each city, the total number of reviews recorded for each city, and the distribution of hotels with respect to the star-rating (as available on the TripAdvisor site).",
        "Note that not all hotels have a star-rating.",
        "Table 1: A summary of the data set.",
        "City # Reviews # Hotels # of Hotels with 1,2,3,4 & 5 stars Boston 3993 58 1+3+17+15+2 Sydney 1371 47 0+0+9+13+10 Las Vegas 5593 40 0+3+10+9+6 For each review we recorded the overall rating, the textual review (title and body of the review) and the numerical rating on 7 features: Rooms(R), Service(S), Cleanliness(C), Value(V), Food(F), Location(L) and Noise(N).",
        "TripAdvisor does not require users to submit anything other than the overall rating, hence a typical review rates few additional features, regardless of the discussion in the textual comment.",
        "Only the features Rooms(R), Service(S), Cleanliness(C) and Value(V) are rated by a significant number of users.",
        "However, we also selected the features Food(F), Location(L) and Noise(N) because they are referred to in a significant number of textual comments.",
        "For each feature we record the numerical rating given by the user, or 0 when the rating is missing.",
        "The typical length of the textual comment amounts to approximately 200 words.",
        "All data was collected by crawling the TripAdvisor site in September 2006. 2.1 Formal notation We will formally refer to a review by a tuple (r, T) where: • r = (rf ) is a vector containing the ratings rf ∈ {0, 1, . . . 5} for the features f ∈ F = {O, R, S, C, V, F, L, N}; note that the overall rating, rO, is abusively recorded as the rating for the feature Overall(O); • T is the textual comment that accompanies the review. 135 Reviews are indexed according to the variable i, such that (ri , Ti ) is the ith review in our database.",
        "Since we dont record the username of the reviewer, we will also say that the ith review in our data set was submitted by user i.",
        "When we need to consider only the reviews of a given hotel, h, we will use (ri(h) , Ti(h) ) to denote the ith review about the hotel h. 3.",
        "EVIDENCE FROM TEXTUAL COMMENTS The free textual comments associated to online reviews are a valuable source of information for understanding the reasons behind the numerical ratings left by the reviewers.",
        "The text may, for example, reveal concrete examples of aspects that the user liked or disliked, thus justifying some of the high, respectively low ratings for certain features.",
        "The text may also offer guidelines for understanding the preferences of the reviewer, and the weights of different features when computing an overall rating.",
        "The problem, however, is that free textual comments are difficult to read.",
        "Users are required to scroll through many reviews and read mostly repetitive information.",
        "Significant improvements would be obtained if the reviews were automatically interpreted and aggregated.",
        "Unfortunately, this seems a difficult task for computers since human users often use witty language, abbreviations, cultural specific phrases, and the figurative style.",
        "Nevertheless, several important results use the textual comments of online reviews in an automated way.",
        "Using well established natural language techniques, reviews or parts of reviews can be classified as having a positive or negative semantic orientation.",
        "Pang et al. [2] classify movie reviews into positive/negative by training three different classifiers (Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy and SVM) using classification features based on unigrams, bigrams or part-of-speech tags.",
        "Dave et al. [4] analyze reviews from CNet and Amazon, and surprisingly show that classification features based on unigrams or bigrams perform better than higher-order n-grams.",
        "This result is challenged by Cui et al. [3] who look at large collections of reviews crawled from the web.",
        "They show that the size of the data set is important, and that bigger training sets allow classifiers to successfully use more complex classification features based on n-grams.",
        "Hu and Liu [11] also crawl the web for product reviews and automatically identify product attributes that have been discussed by reviewers.",
        "They use Wordnet to compute the semantic orientation of product evaluations and summarize user reviews by extracting positive and negative evaluations of different product features.",
        "Popescu and Etzioni [20] analyze a similar setting, but use search engine hit-counts to identify product attributes; the semantic orientation is assigned through the relaxation labeling technique.",
        "Ghose et al. [7, 8] analyze seller reviews from the Amazon secondary market to identify the different dimensions (e.g., delivery, packaging, customer support, etc.) of reputation.",
        "They parse the text, and tag the part-of-speech for each word.",
        "Frequent nouns, noun phrases and verbal phrases are identified as dimensions of reputation, while the corresponding modifiers (i.e., adjectives and adverbs) are used to derive numerical scores for each dimension.",
        "The enhanced reputation measure correlates better with the pricing information observed in the market.",
        "Pavlou and Dimoka [19] analyze eBay reviews and find that textual comments have an important impact on reputation premiums.",
        "Our approach is similar to the previously mentioned works, in the sense that we identify the aspects (i.e., hotel features) discussed by the users in the textual reviews.",
        "However, we do not compute the semantic orientation of the text, nor attempt to infer missing ratings.",
        "We define the weight, wi f , of feature f ∈ F in the text Ti associated with the review (ri , Ti ), as the fraction of Ti dedicated to discussing aspects (both positive and negative) related to feature f. We propose an elementary method to approximate the values of these weights.",
        "For each feature we manually construct the word list Lf containing approximately 50 words that are most commonly associated to the feature f. The initial words were selected from reading some of the reviews, and seeing what words coincide with discussion of which features.",
        "The list was then extended by adding all thesaurus entries that were related to the initial words.",
        "Finally, we brainstormed for missing words that would normally be associated with each of the features.",
        "Let Lf ∩Ti be the list of terms common to both Lf and Ti.",
        "Each term of Lf is counted the number of times it appears in Ti , with two exceptions: • in cases where the user submits a title to the review, we account for the title text by appending it three times to the review text Ti .",
        "The intuitive assumption is that the users opinion is more strongly reflected in the title, rather than in the body of the review.",
        "For example, many reviews are accurately summarized by titles such as Excellent service, terrible location or Bad value for money; • certain words that occur only once in the text are counted multiple times if their relevance to that feature is particularly strong.",
        "These were root words for each feature (e.g., staff is a root word for the feature Service), and were weighted either 2 or 3.",
        "Each feature was assigned up to 3 such root words, so almost all words are counted only once.",
        "The list of words for the feature Rooms is given for reference in Appendix A.",
        "The weight wi f is computed as: wi f = |Lf ∩ Ti| f∈F |Lf ∩ Ti| (1) where |Lf ∩Ti | is the number of terms common to Lf and Ti .",
        "The weight for the feature Overall was set to min{ |T i | 5000 , 1} where |Ti | is the number of character in Ti .",
        "The following is a TripAdvisor review for a Boston hotel (the name of the hotel is omitted): Ill start by saying that Im more of a Holiday Inn person than a *** type.",
        "So I get frustrated when I pay double the room rate and get half the amenities that Id get at a Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn.",
        "The location was definitely the main asset of this place.",
        "It was only a few blocks from the Hynes Center subway stop and it was easy to walk to some good restaurants in the Back Bay area.",
        "Boylston isnt far off at all.",
        "So I had no trouble with foregoing a rental car and taking the subway from the airport to the hotel and using the subway for any other travel.",
        "Otherwise, they make you pay for anything and everything. 136 And when youve already dropped $215/night on the room, that gets frustrating.The room itself was decent, about what I would expect.",
        "Staff was also average, not bad and not excellent.",
        "Again, I think youre paying for location and the ability to walk to a lot of good stuff.",
        "But I think next time Ill stay in Brookline, get more amenities, and use the subway a bit more.",
        "This numerical ratings associated to this review are rO = 3, rR = 3, rS = 3, rC = 4, rV = 2 for features Overall(O), Rooms(R), Service(S), Cleanliness(C) and Value(V) respectively.",
        "The ratings for the features Food(F), Location(L) and Noise(N) are absent (i.e., rF = rL = rN = 0).",
        "The weights wf are computed from the following lists of common terms: LR ∩ T ={room}; wR = 0.066 LS ∩ T ={3 * Staff, amenities}; wS = 0.267 LC ∩ T = ∅; wC = 0 LV ∩ T ={$, rate}; wV = 0.133 LF ∩ T ={restaurant}; wF = 0.067 LL ∩ T ={2 * center, 2 * walk, 2 * location, area}; wL = 0.467 LN ∩ T = ∅; wN = 0 The root words Staff and Center were tripled and doubled respectively.",
        "The overall weight of the textual review is wO = 0.197.",
        "These values account reasonably well for the weights of different features in the discussion of the reviewer.",
        "One point to note is that some terms in the lists Lf possess an inherent semantic orientation.",
        "For example the word grime (belonging to the list LC ) would be used most often to assert the presence, and not the absence of grime.",
        "This is unavoidable, but care was taken to ensure words from both sides of the spectrum were used.",
        "For this reason, some lists such as LR contain only nouns of objects that one would typically describe in a room (see Appendix A).",
        "The goal of this section is to analyse the influence of the weights wi f on the numerical ratings ri f .",
        "Intuitively, users who spent a lot of their time discussing a feature f (i.e., wi f is high) had something to say about their experience with regard to this feature.",
        "Obviously, feature f is important for user i.",
        "Since people tend to be more knowledgeable in the aspects they consider important, our hypothesis is that the ratings ri f (corresponding to high weights wi f ) constitute a subset of expert ratings for feature f. Figure 2 plots the distribution of the rates r i(h) C with respect to the weights w i(h) C for the cleanliness of a Las Vegas hotel, h. Here, the high ratings are restricted to the reviews that discuss little the cleanliness.",
        "Whenever cleanliness appears in the discussion, the ratings are low.",
        "Many hotels exhibit similar rating patterns for various features.",
        "Ratings corresponding to low weights span the whole spectrum from 1 to 5, while the ratings corresponding to high weights are more grouped together (either around good or bad ratings).",
        "We therefore make the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1.",
        "The ratings ri f corresponding to the reviews where wi f is high, are more similar to each other than to the overall collection of ratings.",
        "To test the hypothesis, we take the entire set of reviews, and feature by feature, we compute the standard deviation of the ratings with high weights, and the standard deviation of the entire set of ratings.",
        "High weights were defined as those belonging to the upper 20% of the weight range for the corresponding feature.",
        "If Hypothesis 1 were true, the standard deviation of all ratings should be higher than the standard deviation of the ratings with high weights. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 Rating Weight Figure 2: The distribution of ratings against the weight of the cleanliness feature.",
        "We use a standard T-test to measure the significance of the results.",
        "City by city and feature by feature, Table 2 presents the average standard deviation of all ratings, and the average standard deviation of ratings with high weights.",
        "Indeed, the ratings with high weights have lower standard deviation, and the results are significant at the standard 0.05 significance threshold (although for certain cities taken independently there doesnt seem to be a significant difference, the results are significant for the entire data set).",
        "Please note that only the features O,R,S,C and V were considered, since for the others (F, L, and N) we didnt have enough ratings.",
        "Table 2: Average standard deviation for all ratings, and average standard deviation for ratings with high weights.",

        "We can, for example, construct a feature-by-feature quality estimate with much lower variance: for each feature we take the subset of reviews that amply discuss that feature, and output as a quality estimate the average rating for this subset.",
        "Initial experiments suggest that the average feature-by-feature ratings computed in this way are different from the average ratings computed on the whole data set.",
        "Given that, indeed, high weights are indicators of expert opinions, the estimates obtained in this way are more accurate than the current ones.",
        "Nevertheless, the validation of this underlying assumption requires further controlled experiments. 137 4.",
        "THE INFLUENCE OF PAST RATINGS Two important assumptions are generally made about reviews submitted to online forums.",
        "The first is that ratings truthfully reflect the quality observed by the users; the second is that reviews are independent from one another.",
        "While anecdotal evidence [9, 22] challenges the first assumption3 , in this section, we address the second.",
        "A perusal of online reviews shows that reviews are often part of discussion threads, where users make an effort to contradict, or vehemently agree with the remarks of previous users.",
        "Consider, for example, the following review: I dont understand the negative reviews... the hotel was a little dark, but that was the style.",
        "It was very artsy.",
        "Yes it was close to the freeway, but in my opinion the sound of an occasional loud car is better than hearing the ding ding of slot machines all night!",
        "The staff on-hand is FABULOUS.",
        "The waitresses are great (and *** does not deserve the bad review she got, she was 100% attentive to us! ), the bartenders are friendly and professional at the same time...",
        "Here, the user was disturbed by previous negative reports, addressed these concerns, and set about trying to correct them.",
        "Not surprisingly, his ratings were considerably higher than the average ratings up to this point.",
        "It seems that TripAdvisor users regularly read the reports submitted by previous users before booking a hotel, or before writing a review.",
        "Past reviews create some prior expectation regarding the quality of service, and this expectation has an influence on the submitted review.",
        "We believe this observation holds for most online forums.",
        "The subjective perception of quality is directly proportional to how well the actual experience meets the prior expectation, a fact confirmed by an important line of econometric and marketing research [17, 18, 16, 21].",

        "There might exist a measure of influence exerted by past reports that pushes the user behind report i to submit ratings which to some extent conforms with past reports: a low value for ef (i) can influence user i to submit a low rating for feature f because, for example, he fears that submitting a high rating will make him out to be a person with low standards5 .",
        "This, at first, appears to contradict Hypothesis 2.",

        "In particular, we examine the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 3.",
        "When a large proportion of the text of a review discusses a certain feature, the difference between the rating for that feature and the average rating up to that point tends to be large.",
        "The intuition behind this claim is that when the user is adamant about voicing his opinion regarding a certain feature, his opinion differs from the collective opinion of previous postings.",

        "For a given hotel, we make the assumption that the quality experienced by the users is normally distributed around some value vf , which represents the objective quality offered by the hotel on the feature f. The rating submitted by user i on feature f is: ˆri f = δf vi f + (1 − δf ) · sign vi f − ef (i) c + d(vi f , ef (i)|wi f ) (2) where: • vi f is the (unknown) quality actually experienced by the user. vi f is assumed normally distributed around some value vf ; • δf ∈ [0, 1] can be seen as a measure of the bias when reporting feedback.",
        "High values reflect the fact that users rate objectively, without being influenced by prior expectations.",
        "The value of δf may depend on various factors; we fix one value for each feature f; • c is a constant between 1 and 5; • wi f is the weight of feature f in the textual comment of review i, computed according to Eq. (1); • d(vi f , ef (i)|wi f ) is a distance function between the expectation and the observation of user i.",
        "The distance function satisfies the following properties: - d(y, z|w) ≥ 0 for all y, z ∈ [0, 5], w ∈ [0, 1]; - |d(y, z|w)| < |d(z, x|w)| if |y − z| < |z − x|; - |d(y, z|w1)| < |d(y, z|w2)| if w1 < w2; - c + d(vf , ef (i)|wi f ) ∈ [1, 5]; The second term of Eq. (2) encodes the bias of the rating.",
        "The higher the distance between the true observation vi f and the function ef , the higher the bias. 5.1 Model Validation We use the data set of TripAdvisor reviews to validate the behavior model presented above.",
        "We split for convenience the rating values in three ranges: bad (B = {1, 2}), indifferent (I = {3, 4}), and good (G = {5}), and perform the following two tests: • First, we will use our model to predict the ratings that have extremal values.",
        "For every hotel, we take the sequence of reports, and whenever we encounter a rating that is either good or bad (but not indifferent) we try to predict it using Eq. (2) • Second, instead of predicting the value of extremal ratings, we try to classify them as either good or bad.",
        "For every hotel we take the sequence of reports, and for each report (regardless of it value) we classify it as being good or bad However, to perform these tests, we need to estimate the objective value, vf , that is the average of the true quality observations, vi f .",
        "The algorithm we are using is based on the intuition that the amount of conformity rating is minimized.",
        "In other words, the value vf should be such that as often as possible, bad ratings follow expectations above vf and good ratings follow expectations below vf .",
        "Formally, we define the sets: Γ1 = {i|ef (i) < vf and ri f ∈ B}; Γ2 = {i|ef (i) > vf and ri f ∈ G}; that correspond to irregularities where even though the expectation at point i is lower than the delivered value, the rating is poor, and vice versa.",
        "We define vf as the value that minimize these union of the two sets: vf = arg min vf |Γ1 ∪ Γ2| (3) In Eq. (2) we replace vi f by the value vf computed in Eq. (3), and use the following distance function: d(vf , ef (i)|wi f ) = |vf − ef (i)| vf − ef (i) |vf 2 − ef (i)2 | · (1 + 2wi f ); The constant c ∈ I was set to min{max{ef (i), 3}}, 4}.",
        "The values for δf were fixed at {0.7, 0.7, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6} for the features {Overall, Rooms, Service, Cleanliness, Value} respectively.",
        "The weights are computed as described in Section 3.",
        "As a first experiment, we take the sets of extremal ratings {ri f |ri f /∈ I} for each hotel and feature.",
        "For every such rating, ri f , we try to estimate it by computing ˆri f using Eq. (2).",
        "We compare this estimator with the one obtained by simply averaging the ratings over all hotels and features: i.e., ¯rf = j,r j f =0 rj f j,r j f =0 1 ; Table 7 presents the ratio between the root mean square error (RMSE) when using ˆri f and ¯rf to estimate the actual ratings.",

        "SUMMARY OF RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The goal of this paper is to explore the factors that drive a user to submit a particular rating, rather than the incentives that encouraged him to submit a report in the first place.",
        "For that we use two additional sources of information besides the vector of numerical ratings: first we look at the textual comments that accompany the reviews, and second we consider the reports that have been previously submitted by other users.",
        "Using simple natural language processing algorithms, we were able to establish a correlation between the weight of a certain feature in the textual comment accompanying the review, and the noise present in the numerical rating.",
        "Specifically, it seems that users who discuss amply a certain feature are likely to agree on a common rating.",
        "This observation allows the construction of feature-by-feature estimators of quality that have a lower variance, and are hopefully less noisy.",
        "Nevertheless, further evidence is required to support the intuition that ratings corresponding to high weights are expert opinions that deserve to be given higher priority when computing estimates of quality.",
        "Second, we emphasize the dependence of ratings on previous reports.",
        "Previous reports create an expectation of quality which affects the subjective perception of the user.",
        "We validate two facts about the hotel reviews we collected from TripAdvisor: First, the ratings following low expectations (where the expectation is computed as the average of the previous reports) are likely to be higher than the ratings Table 10: Precision(p), Recall(r), s= 2pr p+r while spotting poor ratings for Sydney O R S C V p 0.650 0.463 0.544 0.550 0.580 σ r 0.234 0.378 0.571 0.169 0.592 s 0.343 0.452 0.557 0.259 0.586 p 0.562 0.615 0.600 0.500 0.600 τ r 0.054 0.098 0.101 0.015 0.175 s 0.098 0.168 0.172 0.030 0.271 following high expectations.",
        "Intuitively, the perception of quality (and consequently the rating) depends on how well the actual experience of the user meets her expectation.",
        "Second, we include evidence from the textual comments, and find that when users devote a large fraction of the text to discussing a certain feature, they are likely to motivate a divergent rating (i.e., a rating that does not conform to the prior expectation).",
        "Intuitively, this supports the hypothesis that review forums act as discussion groups where users are keen on presenting and motivating their own opinion.",
        "We have captured the empirical evidence in a behavior model that predicts the ratings submitted by the users.",
        "The final rating depends, as expected, on the true observation, and on the gap between the observation and the expectation.",
        "The gap tends to have a bigger influence when an important fraction of the textual comment is dedicated to discussing a certain feature.",
        "The proposed model was validated on the empirical data and provides better estimates of the ratings actually submitted.",
        "One assumption that we make is about the existence of an objective quality value vf for the feature f. This is rarely true, especially over large spans of time.",
        "Other explanations might account for the correlation of ratings with past reports.",
        "For example, if ef (i) reflects the true value of f at a point in time, the difference in the ratings following high and low expectations can be explained by hotel revenue models that are maximized when the value is modified accordingly.",
        "However, the idea that variation in ratings is not primarily a function of variation in value turns out to be a useful one.",
        "Our approach to approximate this elusive objective value is by no means perfect, but conforms neatly to the idea behind the model.",
        "A natural direction for future work is to examine concrete applications of our results.",
        "Significant improvements of quality estimates are likely to be obtained by incorporating all empirical evidence about rating behavior.",
        "Exactly how different factors affect the decisions of the users is not clear.",
        "The answer might depend on the particular application, context and culture. 7.",

                "In this paper, we investigate underlying factors that influence user behavior when reporting feedback.",
                "We look at two sources of information besides numerical ratings: linguistic evidence from the textual comment accompanying a review, and patterns in the time sequence of reports.",
                "We first show that groups of users who amply discuss a certain feature are more likely to agree on a common rating for that feature.",
                "Second, we show that a users rating partly reflects the difference between true quality and prior expectation of quality as inferred from previous reviews.",
                "Both give us a less noisy way to produce rating estimates and reveal the reasons behind user bias.",

                "Numerous empirical studies [10, 15, 13, 5] show that buyers seriously consider online feedback when making purchasing decisions, and are willing to pay reputation premiums for products or services that have a good reputation.",
                "Recent analysis, however, raises important questions regarding the ability of existing forums to reflect the real quality of a product.",
                "In the absence of clear incentives, users with a moderate outlook will not bother to voice their opinions, which leads to an unrepresentative sample of reviews.",
                "For example, [12, 1] show that Amazon1 ratings of books or CDs follow with great probability bi-modal, U-shaped distributions where most of the ratings are either very good, or very bad.",
                "Controlled experiments, on the other hand, reveal opinions on the same items that are normally distributed.",
                "Under these circumstances, using the arithmetic mean to predict quality (as most forums actually do) gives the typical user an estimator with high variance that is often false.",
                "Improving the way we aggregate the information available from online reviews requires a deep understanding of the underlying factors that bias the rating behavior of users.",
                "Hu et al. [12] propose the Brag-and-Moan Model where users rate only if their utility of the product (drawn from a normal distribution) falls outside a median interval.",

                "We use text-mining techniques similar to [7] and [3], however, we are only interested in identifying what aspects of the service the user is discussing, without computing the semantic orientation of the text.",
                "We find that users who comment more on the same feature are more likely to agree on a common numerical rating for that particular feature.",
                "Intuitively, lengthy comments reveal the importance of the feature to the user.",
                "Since people tend to be more knowledgeable in the aspects they consider important, users who discuss a given feature in more details might be assumed to have more authority in evaluating that feature.",

                "The subjective perception of the user is influenced by the gap between the prior expectation and the actual performance of the service [17, 18, 16, 21] which will later reflect in the users rating.",
                "We propose a model that captures the dependence of ratings on prior expectations, and validate it using the empirical data we collected.",

(2) encodes the bias of the rating.",

(2) encodes the bias of the rating.",

(2) encodes the bias of the rating.",
