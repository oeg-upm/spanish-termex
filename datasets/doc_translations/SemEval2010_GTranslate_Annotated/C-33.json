Most existing approaches use a centralized selection mechanism to decide which context information is appropriate. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on negotiation with rewards to solving such problem. Distributed context providers negotiate with each other to decide who can provide context and how they allocate proceeds. In order to support our approach, we have designed a concrete negotiation model with rewards. We also evaluate our approach and show that it indeed can choose an appropriate context provider and allocate the proceeds fairly.

INTRODUCTION Context-awareness is a key concept in pervasive computing. Context informs both recognition and mapping by providing a structured, unified view of the world in which the system operates [1]. Context-aware applications exploit context information, such as location, preferences of users and so on, to adapt their behaviors in response to changing requirements of users and pervasive environments. However, one specific kind of context can often be provided by different context providers (sensors or other data sources of context information) with different quality levels. For example, in a smart home, thermometer As measurement precision is 0.1 ◦ C, and thermometer Bs measurement precision is 0.5 ◦ C. Thus A could provide more precise context information about temperature than B. Moreover, sometimes different context providers may provide conflictive context information. For example, different sensors report that the same person is in different places at the same time. Because context-aware applications utilize context information to adapt their behaviors, inappropriate context information may lead to inappropriate behavior. Thus we should design a mechanism to provide appropriate context information for current context-aware applications. In pervasive environments, context providers considered as relatively independent entities, have their own interests. They hope to get proceeds when they provide context information. However, most existing approaches consider context providers as entities without any personal interests, and use a centralized arbitrator provided by the middleware to decide who can provide appropriate context. Thus the burden of the middleware is very heavy, and its decision may be unfair and harm some providers interests. Moreover, when such arbitrator is broken down, it will cause serious consequences for context-aware applications. In this paper, we let distributed context providers themselves decide who provide context information. Since high reputation could help providers get more opportunities to provide context and get more proceeds in the future, providers try to get the right to provide good context to enhance their reputation. In order to get such right, context providers may agree to share some portion of the proceeds with its opponents. Thus context providers negotiate with each other to reach agreement on the issues who can provide context and how they allocate the proceeds. Our approach has some specific advantages: 1. We do not need an arbitrator provided by the middleware of pervasive computing to decide who provides context. Thus it will reduce the burden of the middleware. 2. It is more reasonable that distributed context providers decide who provide context, because it can avoid the serious consequences caused by a breakdown of a centralized arbitrator. 3. It can guarantee providers interests and provide fair proceeds allocation when providers negotiate with each other to reach agreement on their concerned problems. 4. This approach can choose an appropriate provider automatically. It does not need any applications and users intervention. The negotiation model we have designed to support our approach is also a novel model in negotiation domain. This model can help negotiators reach agreement in the present negotiation process by providing some guarantees over the outcome of next negotiation process (i.e. rewards). Negotiator may find current offer and reward worth more than counter-offer which will delay the agreement, and accepts current offer and reward. Without the reward, it may find current offer worth less than the counter-offer, and proposes its counter-offer. It will cost more time to reach agreement. It also expands the negotiation space considered in present negotiation process, and therefore provides more possibilities to find better agreement. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some assumptions. Section 3 describes our approach based on negotiation detailedly, including utility functions, negotiation protocol and context providers strategies. Section 4 evaluates our approach. In section 5 we introduce some related work and conclude in section 6. 2. SOME ASSUMPTIONS Before introducing our approach, we would like to give some assumptions: 1. All context providers are well-meaning and honest. During the negotiation process, they exchange information honestly. Rewards confirmed in this negotiation process will be fulfilled in the next negotiation process. 2. All providers must guarantee the systems interests. They should provide appropriate context information for current applications. After guaranteeing the systems interest, they can try to maximize their own personal interests. The assumption is reasonable, because when an inappropriate context provider gets the right to provide bad context, as a punishment, its reputation will decrease, and the proceeds is also very small. 3. As context providers are independent, factors which influence their negotiation stance and behavior are private and not available to their opponents. Their utility functions are also private. 4. Since the negotiation takes place in pervasive environments, time is a critical factors. The current application often hopes to get context information as quickly as possible, so the time cost to reach agreement should be as short as possible. Context providers often have strict deadline by when the negotiation must be completed. After presenting these assumptions, we will propose our approach based on negotiation with rewards in the next section. 3. OUR APPROACH In the beginning, we introduce the concepts of reputation and Quality of Context (QoC) attributes. Both will be used in our approach. Reputation of an agent is a perception regarding its behavior norms, which is held by other agents, based on experiences and observation of its past actions [7]. Here agent means context provider. Each providers reputation indicates its historical ability to provide appropriate context information. Quality of Context (QoC) attributes characterize the quality of context information. When applications require context information, they should specify their QoC requirements which express constraints of QoC attributes. Context providers can specify QoC attributes for the context information they deliver. Although we can decide who provides appropriate context according to QoC requirements and context providers QoC information, applications QoC requirements might not reflect the actual quality requirements. Thus, in addition to QoC, reputation information of context providers is another factor affecting the decision who can provide context information. Negotiation is a process by which a joint decision is made by two or more parties. The parties first verbalize contradictory demands and then move towards agreement by a process of concession making or search for new alternatives [2]. In pervasive environments, all available context providers negotiate with each other to decide who can provide context information. This process will be repeated because a kind of context is needed more than one time. Negotiation using persuasive arguments (such as threats, promises of future rewards, and appeals) allows negotiation parties to influence each others preferences to reach better deals effectively and efficiently [9]. This pervasive negotiation is effective in repeated interaction because arguments can be constructed to directly impact future encounters. In this paper, for simplicity, we let negotiation take place between two providers. We extend Raiffas basic model for bilateral negotiation [8], and allow negotiators to negotiate with each other by exchanging arguments in the form of promises of future rewards or requests for future rewards. Rewards mean some extra proceeds in the next negotiation process. They can influence outcomes of current and future negotiation. In our approach, as described by Figure 1, the current application requires Context Manager to provide a specific type of context information satisfying QoC requirements. Context Manager finds that provider A and B can provide such kind of context with different quality levels. Then the manager tells A and B to negotiate to reach agreement on who can provide the context information and how they will allocate the proceeds. Both providers get reputation information from the database Reputation of Context Providers and QoC requirements, and then negotiate with each other according to our negotiation model. When negotiation is completed, the chosen provider will provide the context information to Context Manager, and then Context Manager delivers such information to the application and also stores it in Context Knowledge Base where current and historical context information is stored. The current application gives the feedback information about the provided context, and then Context Manager will update the chosen providers reputation information according to the feedback information. Context Manager also provides the proceeds to providers according to the feedback information and the time cost on negotiation. In the following parts of this section, we describe our negotiation model in detail, including context providers utility functions to evaluate offers and rewards, negotiation protocol, and strategies to generate offers and rewards. Context Knowledge Base Reputation of Context Providers Context provider A Context Manager Negotiate Applications QoC requirements and feedback Provide QoC requirements and proceeds Manage Context Provide Context Getreputation Getreputation Update reputation information according to feedback Context provider B Figure 1: Negotiate to provide appropriate context information. 3.1 Utility function During the negotiation process, one provider proposes an offer and a reward to the other provider. An offer is noted as o = (c, p): c indicates the chosen context provider and its domain is Dc (i.e. the two context providers participating in the negotiation); p means the proposers portion of the proceeds, and its domain is Dp = [0,1]. Its opponents portion of the proceeds is 1−p. The reward eps domain is Dep = [-1,1], and |ep| means the extra portion of proceeds the proposer promises to provide or requests in the next negotiation process. ep < 0 means the proposer promises to provide reward, ep > 0 means the proposer requests reward and ep =0 means no reward. The opponent evaluates the offer and reward to decide to accept them or propose a counter-offer and a reward. Thus context providers should have utility functions to evaluate offers and rewards. Time is a critical factor, and only at times in the set T = {0, 1, 2, . . . tdeadline}, context providers can propose their offers. The set O include all available offers. Context provider As utility function of the offer and reward at time t UA : O × Dep × T → [−1, 1] is defined as: UA(o,ep,t)=(wA 1 ·UA c (c)+wA 2 ·UA p (p)+wA 3 ·UA ep(ep))·δA(t) (1) Similarly, the utility function of As opponent (i.e. B) can be defined as: UB(o,ep,t)=(wB 1 ·UB c (c)+wB 2 ·UB p (1−p)+wB 3 ·UB ep(−ep))·δB(t) In (1), wA 1 , wA 2 and wA 3 are weights given to c, p and ep respectively, and wA 1 + wA 2 + wA 3 =1. Usually, the context provider pays the most attention to the systems interests, pays the least attention to the reward, thus wA 1 > wA 2 > wA 3 . UA c : Dc → [−1, 1] is the utility function of the issue who provides context. This function is determined by two factors: the distance between cs QoC and current applications QoC requirements, and cs reputation. The two negotiators acquire cs QoC information from c, and we use the approach proposed in [4] to calculate the distance between cs QoC and the applications Qoc requirements. The required context has n QoC attributes and let the applications wishes for this context be a = (a1, a2 . . . an) (where ai = means the applications indifference to the i-th QoC attribute), cs QoC attributes cp = (cp1, cp2 . . . cpn) (where cpi = means cs inability to provide a quantitative value for the i-th QoC attribute). Because numerical distance values of different properties are combined, e.g. location precision in metres with refresh rate in Hz, thus a standard scale for all dimension is needed. The scaling factors for the QoC attributes are s = (s1, s2 . . . sn). In addition, different QoC attributes may have different weights: w = (w1, w2 . . . wn). Then d = (d1, d2 . . . dn) di = (cpi − ai) · si · wi where cpi−ai = 0 for ai = and cpi−ai = o(ai) for cpi = ( o(.) determines the applications satisfaction or dissatisfaction when c is unable to provide an estimate of a QoC attribute, given the value wished for by the application). The distance can be linear distance (1-norm), Euclidean distance (2-norm), or the maximum distance (max-norm): |d| = |d1| + |d2| + . . . + |dn| (1 − norm) ||d||2 = |d1|2 + |d2|2 + . . . + |dn|2 (2 − norm) ||d||∞ = max{|d1|, |d2| . . . |dn|} (max − norm) The detail description of this calculation can be found in [4]. Reputation of c can be acquired from the database Reputation of Context Providers. UA c (c) : R × Drep → [−1, 1] can be defined as: UA c (c) = wA c1 · UA d (d) + wA c2 · UA rep(rep) wA c1 and wA c2 are weights given to the distance and reputation respectively, and wA c1 + wA c2 = 1. Drep is the domain of reputation information. UA d : R → [0, 1] is a monotonedecreasing function and UA rep : Drep → [−1, 1] is a monotoneincreasing function. UA p : Dp → [0, 1] is the utility function of the portion of proceeds A will receive and it is also a monotone-increasing function. As utility function of reward ep UA ep : Dep → [−1, 1] is also a monotone-increasing function and UA ep(0) = 0. δA : T → [0, 1] is the time discount function. It is also a monotone-decreasing function. When time t cost on negotiation increases, δA(t) will decrease, and the utility will also decrease. Thus both negotiators want to reach agreement as quickly as possible to avoid loss of utility. 3.2 Negotiation protocol When provider A and B have got QoC requirements and reputation information, they begin to negotiate. They first set their reserved (the lowest acceptable) utility which can guarantee the systems interests and their personal interests. When the context provider finds the utility of an offer and a reward is lower than its reserved utility, it will reject this proposal and terminate the negotiation process. The provider who starts the negotiation is chosen randomly. We assume A starts the negotiation, and it proposes offer o and reward ep to B according to its strategy (see subsection 3.3). When B receives the proposal from A, it uses its utility function to evaluate it. If it is lower than its reserved utility, the provider terminates the negotiation. Otherwise, if UB(o, ep, t) ≥ UB(o , ep , t + 1) i.e. the utility of o and ep proposed by A at time t is greater than the utility of offer o and reward ep which B will propose to A at time t + 1, B will accept this offer and reward. The negotiation is completed. However, if UB(o, ep, t) < UB(o , ep , t + 1) then B will reject As proposal, and propose its counter-offer and reward to A. When A receives Bs counter-offer and reward, A evaluates them using its utility function, and compares the utility with the utility of offer and reward it wants to propose to B at time t+2, decides to accept it or give its counter-offer and reward. This negotiation process continues and in each negotiation round, context providers concede in order to reach agreement. The negotiation will be successfully finished when agreement is reached, or be terminated forcibly due to deadline or the utility lower than reserved utility. When negotiation is forced to be terminated, Context manager will ask A and B to calculate UA c (A), UA c (B), UB c (A) and UB c (B) respectively. If UA c (A) + UB c (A) > UA c (B) + UB c (B) Context Manager let A provide context. If UA c (A) + UB c (A) < UA c (B) + UB c (B) then B will get the right to provide context information. When UA c (A) + UB c (A) = UA c (B) + UB c (B) Context Manager will select a provider from A and B randomly. In addition, Context Manager allocates the proceeds between the two providers. Although we can select one provider when negotiation is terminated forcibly, however, this may lead to the unfair allocation of the proceeds. Moreover, more time negotiators cost on negotiation, less proceeds will be given. Thus negotiators will try to reach agreement as soon as possible in order to avoid unnecessary loss. When the negotiation is finished, the chosen provider provides the context information to Context Manager which will deliver the information to current application. According to the applications feedback information about this context, Context Manager updates the providers reputation stored in Reputation of Context Providers. The providers reputation may be enhanced or decreased. In addition, according to the feedback and the negotiation time, Context Manager will give proceeds to the provider. Then the provider will share the proceeds with its opponent according to the negotiation outcome and the reward confirmed in the last negotiation process. For example, in the last negotiation process A promised to give reward ep (0 ≤ ep < 1) to B, and As portion of the proceeds is p in current negotiation. Then As actual portion of the proceeds is p · (1 − ep), and its opponent Bs portion of the proceeds is 1−p+p·ep. 3.3 Negotiation strategy The context provider might want to pursue the right to provide context information blindly in order to enhance its reputation. However when it finally provides bad context information, its reputation will be decreased and the proceeds is also very small. Thus the context provider should take action according to its strategy. The aim of providers negotiation strategy is to determine the best course of action which will result in a negotiation outcome maximizing its utility function (i.e how to generate an offer and a reward). In our negotiation model, the context provider generates its offer and reward according to its pervious offer and reward and the last one sent by its opponent. At the beginning of the negotiation, context providers initialize their offers and rewards according to their beliefs and their reserved utility. If context provider A considers that it can provide good context and wants to enhance reputation, then it will propose that A provides the context information, shares some proceeds with its opponent B, and even promises to give reward. However, if A considers that it may provide bad context, A will propose that its opponent B provide the context, and require B to share some proceeds and provide reward. During the negotiation process, we assume that at time t A proposes offer ot and reward ept to B, at time t + 1, B proposes counter-offer ot+1 and reward ept+1 to A. Then at time t + 2, when the utility of Bs proposal is greater than As reserved utility, A gives its response. Now we calculate the expected utility to be conceded at time t +2, we use Cu to express the conceded utility. Cu = (UA(ot, ept, t) − UA(ot+1, ept+1, t + 1)) · cA(t + 2) (UA(ot, ept, t) > UA(ot+1, ept+1, t + 1), otherwise, A will accept Bs proposal) where cA : T → [0, 1] is a monotoneincreasing function. cA(t) indicates As utility concession rate1 . A concedes a little in the beginning before conceding significantly towards the deadline. Then A generates its offer ot+2 = (ct+2, pt+2) and reward ept+2 at time t + 2. The expected utility of A at time t + 2 is: UA(ot+2, ept+2, t + 2) = UA(ot, ept, t + 2) − Cu If UA(ot+2, ept+2, t + 2) ≤ UA(ot+1, ept+1, t + 1) then A will accept Bs proposal (i.e. ot+1 and ept+1). Otherwise, A will propose its counter-offer and reward based on Cu. We assume that Cu is distributed evenly on c, p and ep (i.e. the utility to be conceded on c, p and ep is 1 3 Cu respectively). If |UA c (ct)−(UA c (ct)− 1 3 Cu δA(t+2) )| ≤ |UA c (ct+1)−(UA c (ct)− 1 3 Cu δA(t+2) )| i.e. the expected utility of c at time t+2 is UA c (ct)− 1 3 Cu δA(t+2) and it is closer to the utility of As proposal ct at time t, then at time t + 2, ct+2 = ct, else the utility is closer to Bproposal ct+1 and ct+2 = ct+1. When ct+2 is equal to ct, the actual conceded utility of c is 0, and the total concession of p and ep is Cu. We divide the total concession of p and ep evenly, and get the conceded utility of p and ep respectively. We calculate pt+2 and ept+2 as follows: pt+2 = (UA p )−1 (UA p (pt) − 1 2 Cu δA(t + 2) ) ept+2 = (UA ep)−1 (UA ep(ept) − 1 2 Cu δA(t + 2) ) When ct+2 is equal to ct+1, the actual conceded utility of c is |UA c (ct+2) − UA c (ct)|, the total concession of p and ep is Cu δA(t+2) − |UA c (ct+2) − UA c (ct)|, then: pt+2 = (UA p )−1 (UA p (pt)− 1 2 ( Cu δA(t + 2) −|UA c (ct+2)−UA c (ct)|)) ept+2 = (UA ep)−1 (UA ep(ept)−1 2 ( Cu δA(t+2) −|UA c (ct+2)−UA c (ct)|)) Now, we have generated the offer and reward A will propose at time t + 2. Similarly, B also can generate its offer and reward. 1 For example, cA(t) = ( t tdeadline ) 1 β (0 < β < 1) Utility function and weight of c, p and ep Uc, w1 Up, w2 Uep, w3 A 0.5(1 − dA 500 ) + 0.5repA 1000 , 0.6 0.9p, 0.3 0.9ep, 0.1 B 0.52(1 − dB 500 ) + 0.48repB 1000 , 0.5 0.9p, 0.45 0.8ep, 0.05 Table 1: Utility functions and weights of c, p and ep for each provider 4. EVALUATION In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by simulated experiments. Context providers A and B negotiate to reach agreement. They get QoC requirements and calculate the distance between Qoc requirements and their QoC. For simplicity, in our experiments, we assume that the distance has been calculated, and dA represents distance between QoC requirements and As QoC, dB represents distance between QoC requirements and Bs QoC. The domain of dA and dB is [0,500]. We assume reputation value is a real number and its domain is [-1000, 1000], repA represents As reputation value and repB represents Bs reputation value. We assume that both providers pay the most attention to the systems interests, and pay the least attention to the reward, thus w1 > w2 > w3, and the weight of Ud approximates the weight of Urep. A and Bs utility functions and weights of c, p and ep are defined in Table 1. We set deadline tdeadline = 100, and define time discount function δ(t) and concession rate function c(t) of A and B as follows: δA(t) = 0.9t δB(t) = 0.88t cA(t) = ( t tdeadline ) 1 0.8 cB(t) = ( t tdeadline ) 1 0.6 Given different values of dA, dB, repA and repB, A and B negotiate to reach agreement. The provider that starts the negotiation is chosen at random. We hope that when dA dB and repA repB, A will get the right to provide context and get a major portion of the proceeds, and when ∆d = dA − dB is in a small range (e.g. [-50,50]) and ∆rep = repA − repB is in a small range (e.g. [-50,50]), A and B will get approximately equal opportunities to provide context, and allocate the proceeds evenly. When dA−dB 500 approximates to dA−dB 1000 (i.e. the two providers abilities to provide context information are approximately equal), we also hope that A and B get equal opportunities to provide context and allocate the proceeds evenly. According to the three situations above, we make three experiments as follows: Experiment 1 : In this experiment, A and B negotiate with each other for 50 times, and at each time, we assign different values to dA, dB, repA, repB (satisfying dA dB and repA repB) and the reserved utilities of A and B. When the experiment is completed, we find 3 negotiation games are terminated due to the utility lower than the reserved utility. A gets the right to provide context for 47 times. The average portion of proceeds A get is about 0.683, and Bs average portion of proceeds is 0.317. The average time cost to reach agreement is 8.4. We also find that when B asks A to provide context in its first offer, B can require and get more portion of the proceeds because of its goodwill. Experiment 2 : A and B also negotiate with each other for 50 times in this experiment given different values of dA, dB, repA, repB (satisfying −50 ≤ ∆d = dA − dB ≤ 50 and −50 ≤ ∆rep = drep −drep ≤ 50) and the reserved utilities of A and B. After the experiment, we find that there are 8 negotiation games terminated due to the utility lower than the reserved utility. A and B get the right to provide context for 20 times and 22 times respectively. The average portion of proceeds A get is 0.528 and Bs average portion of the proceeds is 0.472. The average time cost on negotiation is 10.5. Experiment 3 : In this experiment, A and B also negotiate with each other for 50 times given dA, dB, repA, repB (satisfying −0.2 ≤ dA−dB 500 − dA−dB 1000 ≤ 0.2) and the reserved utilities of A and B. There are 6 negotiation games terminated forcibly. A and B get the right to provide context for 21 times and 23 times respectively. The average portion of proceeds A get is 0.481 and Bs average portion of the proceeds is 0.519. The average time cost on negotiation is 9.2. One thing should be mentioned is that except for d, rep, p and ep, other factors (e.g. weights, time discount function δ(t) and concession rate function c(t)) could also affect the negotiation outcome. These factors should be adjusted according to providers beliefs at the beginning of each negotiation process. In our experiments, for similarity, we assign values to them without any particularity in advance. These experiments results prove that our approach can choose an appropriate context provider and can provide a relatively fair proceeds allocation. When one provider is obviously more appropriate than the other provider, the provider will get the right to provide context and get a major portion of the proceeds. When both providers have the approximately same abilities to provide context, their opportunities to provide context are equal and they can get about a half portion of the proceeds respectively. 5. RELATED WORK In [4], Huebscher and McCann have proposed an adaptive middleware design for context-aware applications. Their adaptive middleware uses utility functions to choose the best context provider (given the QoC requirements of applications and the QoC of alternative means of context acquisition). In our negotiation model, the calculation of utility function Uc was inspired by this approach. Henricksen and Indulska propose an approach to modelling and using imperfect information in [3]. They characterize various types and sources of imperfect context information and present a set of novel context modelling constructs. They also outline a software infrastructure that supports the management and use of imperfect context information. Judd and Steenkiste in [5] describe a generic interface to query context services allowing clients to specify their quality requirements as bounds on accuracy, confidence, update time and sample interval. In [6], Lei et al. present a context service which accepts freshness and confidence meta-data from context sources, and passes this along to clients so that they can adjust their level of trust accordingly. [10] presents a framework for realizing dynamic context consistency management. The framework supports inconsistency detection based on a semantic matching and inconsistency triggering model, and inconsistency resolution with proactive actions to context sources. Most approaches to provide appropriate context utilize a centralized arbitrator. In our approach, we let distributed context providers themselves decide who can provide appropriate context information. Our approach can reduce the burden of the middleware, because we do not need the middleware to provide a context selection mechanism. It can avoid the serious consequences caused by a breakdown of the arbitrator. Also, it can guarantee context providers interests. 6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK How to provide the appropriate context information is a challenging problem in pervasive computing. In this paper, we have presented a novel approach based on negotiation with rewards to attempt to solve such problem. Distributed context providers negotiate with each other to reach agreement on the issues who can provide the appropriate context and how they allocate the proceeds. The results of our experiments have showed that our approach can choose an appropriate context provider, and also can guarantee providers interests by a relatively fair proceeds allocation. In this paper, we only consider how to choose an appropriate context provider from two providers. In the future work, this negotiation model will be extended, and more than two context providers can negotiate with each other to decide who is the most appropriate context provider. In the extended negotiation model, how to design efficient negotiation strategies will be a challenging problem. We assume that the context provider will fulfill its promise of reward in the next negotiation process. In fact, the context provider might deceive its opponent and provide illusive promise. We should solve this problem in the future. We also should deal with interactions which are interrupted by failing communication links in the future work. 7.

Categorías y descriptores de sujetos C.2.4 [Sistemas distribuidos]: Aplicaciones distribuidas que proporcionan información del contexto Términos generales contexto 1. Introducción La conciencia del contexto es un concepto clave en la informática generalizada. El contexto informa tanto el reconocimiento como el mapeo proporcionando una visión estructurada y unificada del mundo en la que opera el sistema [1]. Las aplicaciones conscientes de contexto explotan la información de contexto, como la ubicación, las preferencias de los usuarios, etc., para adaptar sus comportamientos en respuesta a los requisitos cambiantes de los usuarios y los entornos generalizados. Sin embargo, un tipo de contexto específico a menudo puede ser proporcionado por diferentes proveedores de contexto (sensores u otras fuentes de datos de información de contexto) con diferentes niveles de calidad. Por ejemplo, en un hogar inteligente, el termómetro como precisión de medición es 0.1 ° C, y la precisión de medición de BS del termómetro es 0.5 ° C. Por lo tanto, A podría proporcionar información de contexto más precisa sobre la temperatura que B. Además, a veces los diferentes proveedores de contexto pueden proporcionar información de contexto conflictivo. Por ejemplo, diferentes sensores informan que la misma persona se encuentra en diferentes lugares al mismo tiempo. Debido a que las aplicaciones conscientes de contexto utilizan información de contexto para adaptar sus comportamientos, la información de contexto inapropiada puede conducir a un comportamiento inapropiado. Por lo tanto, debemos diseñar un mecanismo para proporcionar información de contexto adecuada para las aplicaciones actuales de contexto. En entornos generalizados, los proveedores de contexto considerados como entidades relativamente independientes tienen sus propios intereses. Esperan obtener ganancias cuando proporcionen información de contexto. Sin embargo, la mayoría de los enfoques existentes consideran a los proveedores de contexto como entidades sin ningún interés personal, y utilizan un árbitro centralizado proporcionado por el middleware para decidir quién puede proporcionar el contexto apropiado. Por lo tanto, la carga del middleware es muy pesada, y su decisión puede ser injusta y dañar los intereses de algunos proveedores. Además, cuando dicho árbitro se descompone, causará graves consecuencias para las aplicaciones con el contexto. En este documento, dejamos que los proveedores de contexto distribuidos decidan quién proporciona información de contexto. Dado que la alta reputación podría ayudar a los proveedores a obtener más oportunidades para proporcionar contexto y obtener más ingresos en el futuro, los proveedores intentan obtener el derecho de proporcionar un buen contexto para mejorar su reputación. Para obtener tal derecho, los proveedores de contexto pueden aceptar compartir una parte de los ingresos con sus oponentes. Por lo tanto, los proveedores de contexto negocian entre sí para llegar a un acuerdo sobre los temas que pueden proporcionar contexto y cómo asignan los ingresos. Nuestro enfoque tiene algunas ventajas específicas: 1. No necesitamos un árbitro proporcionado por el middleware de la computación generalizada para decidir quién proporciona contexto. Por lo tanto, reducirá la carga del middleware.2. Es más razonable que los proveedores de contexto distribuidos decidan quién proporciona contexto, ya que puede evitar las graves consecuencias causadas por un desglose de un árbitro centralizado.3. Puede garantizar los intereses de los proveedores y proporcionar una asignación de ingresos justos cuando los proveedores negocian entre sí para llegar a un acuerdo sobre sus problemas preocupados.4. Este enfoque puede elegir un proveedor apropiado automáticamente. No necesita ninguna aplicación y intervención de usuarios. El modelo de negociación que hemos diseñado para apoyar nuestro enfoque también es un modelo novedoso en el dominio de negociación. Este modelo puede ayudar a los negociadores a llegar a un acuerdo en el actual proceso de negociación al proporcionar algunas garantías sobre el resultado del próximo proceso de negociación (es decir, recompensas). El negociador puede encontrar una oferta y una recompensa actual que vale más que una contratación, lo que retrasará el acuerdo y acepta la oferta y recompensa actuales. Sin la recompensa, puede encontrar que la oferta actual vale menos que la contraoferta, y propone su contraoferta. Costará más tiempo llegar a un acuerdo. También expande el espacio de negociación considerado en el proceso de negociación actual y, por lo tanto, proporciona más posibilidades para encontrar un mejor acuerdo. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La Sección 2 presenta algunos supuestos. La Sección 3 describe nuestro enfoque basado en la negociación detalladamente, incluidas las funciones de servicios públicos, el protocolo de negociación y las estrategias de proveedores de contexto. La Sección 4 evalúa nuestro enfoque. En la Sección 5 presentamos algún trabajo relacionado y concluimos en la Sección 6. 2. Algunos supuestos antes de introducir nuestro enfoque, nos gustaría dar algunas suposiciones: 1. Todos los proveedores de contexto son bien intencionados y honestos. Durante el proceso de negociación, intercambian información honestamente. Las recompensas confirmadas en este proceso de negociación se cumplirán en el próximo proceso de negociación.2. Todos los proveedores deben garantizar los intereses de los sistemas. Deben proporcionar información de contexto apropiada para las aplicaciones actuales. Después de garantizar el interés de los sistemas, pueden intentar maximizar sus propios intereses personales. La suposición es razonable, porque cuando un proveedor de contexto inapropiado obtiene el derecho de proporcionar un mal contexto, como castigo, su reputación disminuirá y los ingresos también son muy pequeños.3. Como los proveedores de contexto son independientes, los factores que influyen en su postura y comportamiento de negociación son privados y no están disponibles para sus oponentes. Sus funciones de utilidad también son privadas.4. Dado que la negociación tiene lugar en entornos generalizados, el tiempo es un factor crítico. La aplicación actual a menudo espera obtener información de contexto lo más rápido posible, por lo que el costo de tiempo para llegar a un acuerdo debe ser lo más corto posible. Los proveedores de contexto a menudo tienen una fecha límite estricta cuando se debe completar la negociación. Después de presentar estos supuestos, propondremos nuestro enfoque basado en la negociación con recompensas en la siguiente sección.3. Nuestro enfoque al principio, presentamos los conceptos de reputación y calidad de la calidad del contexto (QOC). Ambos se utilizarán en nuestro enfoque. La reputación de un agente es una percepción con respecto a sus normas de comportamiento, que poseen otros agentes, basados en experiencias y observación de sus acciones pasadas [7]. Aquí el agente significa proveedor de contexto. La reputación de cada proveedor indica su capacidad histórica para proporcionar información de contexto adecuada. Los atributos de calidad de contexto (QOC) caracterizan la calidad de la información del contexto. Cuando las aplicaciones requieren información de contexto, deben especificar sus requisitos QOC que expresan restricciones de los atributos QOC. Los proveedores de contexto pueden especificar atributos QOC para la información de contexto que entregan. Aunque podemos decidir quién proporciona el contexto apropiado de acuerdo con los requisitos de QOC y la información de los proveedores de contexto QOC, los requisitos de QOC de las aplicaciones pueden no reflejar los requisitos de calidad reales. Por lo tanto, además de QOC, la información de reputación de los proveedores de contexto es otro factor que afecta la decisión que puede proporcionar información de contexto. La negociación es un proceso por el cual una decisión conjunta es tomada por dos o más partes. Las partes primero verbalizan las demandas contradictorias y luego avanzan hacia un acuerdo mediante un proceso de fabricación de concesión o buscan nuevas alternativas [2]. En entornos generalizados, todos los proveedores de contexto disponibles negocian entre sí para decidir quién puede proporcionar información de contexto. Este proceso se repetirá porque se necesita un tipo de contexto más de una vez. La negociación utilizando argumentos persuasivos (como amenazas, promesas de recompensas futuras y apelaciones) permite que las partes de negociación influyan en las preferencias de los demás para alcanzar mejores ofertas de manera efectiva y eficiente [9]. Esta negociación generalizada es efectiva en la interacción repetida porque los argumentos pueden construirse para afectar directamente los encuentros futuros. En este documento, por simplicidad, dejamos que la negociación tenga lugar entre dos proveedores. Extendemos el modelo básico de Raiffas para la negociación bilateral [8], y permitimos a los negociadores negociar entre sí intercambiando argumentos en forma de promesas de recompensas futuras o solicitudes de recompensas futuras. Las recompensas significan algunos ingresos adicionales en el próximo proceso de negociación. Pueden influir en los resultados de la negociación actual y futura. En nuestro enfoque, como se describe en la Figura 1, la aplicación actual requiere que el gerente de contexto proporcione un tipo específico de información de contexto que satisfaga los requisitos de QOC. El gerente de contexto encuentra que el proveedor A y B pueden proporcionar este tipo de contexto con diferentes niveles de calidad. Luego, el gerente le dice a A y B que negocie para llegar a un acuerdo sobre quién puede proporcionar la información del contexto y cómo asignarán los ingresos. Ambos proveedores obtienen información de reputación de la reputación de la base de datos de los proveedores de contexto y los requisitos de QOC, y luego negocian entre sí de acuerdo con nuestro modelo de negociación. Cuando se complete la negociación, el proveedor elegido proporcionará la información de contexto al gerente de contexto, y luego el gerente de contexto entrega dicha información a la aplicación y también la almacena en la base de conocimiento del contexto donde se almacena la información de contexto actual e histórica. La aplicación actual proporciona la información de comentarios sobre el contexto provisto, y luego el administrador de contexto actualizará la información de reputación de los proveedores elegidos de acuerdo con la información de comentarios. El gerente de contexto también proporciona los ingresos a los proveedores de acuerdo con la información de comentarios y el costo de tiempo sobre la negociación. En las siguientes partes de esta sección, describimos nuestro modelo de negociación en detalle, incluidas las funciones de utilidad de los proveedores de contexto para evaluar las ofertas y recompensas, el protocolo de negociación y las estrategias para generar ofertas y recompensas. Contexto Base de conocimiento Reputación de proveedores de contexto Proveedor de contexto Un gerente de contexto negocia las aplicaciones Los requisitos y los comentarios de QOC proporcionan requisitos de QOC y los ingresos administran el contexto Proporcionar contexto GetReputation getReputation Actualizar la información de reputación de acuerdo con la retroalimentación Proveedor de contexto B Figura 1: Negociar para proporcionar información de contexto adecuada.3.1 Función de utilidad Durante el proceso de negociación, un proveedor propone una oferta y una recompensa para el otro proveedor. Se observa una oferta como O = (C, P): C indica el proveedor de contexto elegido y su dominio es DC (es decir, los dos proveedores de contexto que participan en la negociación);P significa la porción de propuestas de los ingresos, y su dominio es dp = [0,1]. Su porción de oponentes de los ingresos es 1 - P. El dominio EPS de recompensa es DEP = [-1,1] y | EP |significa que la parte adicional de los ingresos que el proponente promete proporcionar o solicitudes en el próximo proceso de negociación.EP <0 significa que el proponente promete proporcionar una recompensa, ep> 0 significa que el proponente solicita recompensa y ep = 0 significa que no hay recompensa. El oponente evalúa la oferta y la recompensa para decidir aceptarlos o proponer una contraoferta y una recompensa. Por lo tanto, los proveedores de contexto deben tener funciones de utilidad para evaluar ofertas y recompensas. El tiempo es un factor crítico, y solo a veces en el conjunto t = {0, 1, 2 ,...TDeadLine}, los proveedores de contexto pueden proponer sus ofertas. El set O incluye todas las ofertas disponibles. Proveedor de contexto como función de utilidad de la oferta y recompensa en el momento T UA: O × DEP × T → [−1, 1] se define como: UA (O, EP, T) = (WA 1 · UA C (C)+wa 2 · ua p (p)+wa 3 · ua ep (ep)) · Δa (t) (1) De manera similar, la función de utilidad de como oponente (es decir, B) se puede definir como: Ub (O, EP, T) = (WB 1 · Ub C (C)+Wb 2 · Ub P (1 - P)+WB 3 · UB EP (−ep)) · ΔB (t) en (1), WA 1, WA 2 y WA 3 son pesos dados a C, P y EP respectivamente, y WA 1 + WA 2 + WA 3 = 1. Por lo general, el proveedor de contexto presta la mayor atención a los intereses de los sistemas, presta la menor atención a la recompensa, por lo tanto, wa 1> wa 2> wa 3. UA C: DC → [−1, 1] es la función de utilidad del problema que proporciona contexto. Esta función está determinada por dos factores: la distancia entre los requisitos CS QOC y las aplicaciones actuales QOC, y la reputación de CS. Los dos negociadores adquieren información CS QOC de C, y utilizamos el enfoque propuesto en [4] para calcular la distancia entre CS QOC y los requisitos de aplicaciones QOC. El contexto requerido tiene atributos n qoc y permite que las aplicaciones deseen que este contexto sea a = (a1, a2 ... an) (donde ai = significa la indiferencia de las aplicaciones al atributo I-th QOC), CS QOC atribuye cp = ((CP1, CP2 ... CPN) (donde CPI = significa incapacidad de CS para proporcionar un valor cuantitativo para el atributo QOC I-th). Debido a que se combinan los valores de distancia numéricos de diferentes propiedades, p.Precisión de ubicación en metros con velocidad de actualización en Hz, por lo tanto, se necesita una escala estándar para toda dimensión. Los factores de escala para los atributos QOC son S = (S1, S2 ... Sn). Además, diferentes atributos QOC pueden tener diferentes pesos: W = (W1, W2 ... Wn). Entonces d = (d1, d2 ... dn) di = (cpi - ai) · si · wi donde cpi - ai = 0 para ai = y cpi --i = o (ai) para cpi = (o (.) DeterminaLa satisfacción o la insatisfacción de las aplicaciones cuando C no puede proporcionar una estimación de un atributo QOC, dado el valor deseado por la aplicación). La distancia puede ser la distancia lineal (norma 1), la distancia euclidiana (2-norma) o la distancia máxima (norma máxima): | d |= | D1 |+ | D2 |+...+ | DN |(1 - norma) || d || 2 = | d1 | 2 + | d2 | 2 +...+ | dn | 2 (2 - norma) || d || ∞ = max {| d1 |, | d2 |...| DN |} (MAX - Norma) La descripción detallada de este cálculo se puede encontrar en [4]. La reputación de C se puede adquirir de la reputación de la base de datos de proveedores de contexto. UA C (C): R × Drep → [−1, 1] se puede definir como: UA C (C) = WA C1 · UA D (D) + WA C2 · UA Rep (Rep) Wa C1 y Wa C2 sonPesos dados a la distancia y la reputación respectivamente, y WA C1 + WA C2 = 1. Drep es el dominio de la información de reputación. UA D: R → [0, 1] es una función de preparación de monotoneded y UA Rep: Drep → [−1, 1] es una función monótona. UA P: DP → [0, 1] es la función de utilidad de la porción de los procedimientos que recibirá y también es una función que aumenta el monótono. Como la función de utilidad de la recompensa EP UA EP: DEP → [−1, 1] es también una función de aumento de monótono y UA EP (0) = 0. ΔA: T → [0, 1] es la función de descuento de tiempo. También es una función de recuperación monótona. Cuando el tiempo T costo en la negociación aumenta, ΔA (t) disminuirá y la utilidad también disminuirá. Por lo tanto, ambos negociadores desean llegar a un acuerdo lo más rápido posible para evitar la pérdida de servicios públicos.3.2 Protocolo de negociación Cuando el proveedor A y B tienen requisitos de QOC e información de reputación, comienzan a negociar. Primero establecieron su utilidad reservada (la más baja aceptable) que puede garantizar los intereses de los sistemas y sus intereses personales. Cuando el proveedor de contexto encuentra la utilidad de una oferta y una recompensa es menor que su utilidad reservada, rechazará esta propuesta y terminará el proceso de negociación. El proveedor que inicia la negociación se elige al azar. Asumimos que A comienza la negociación, y propone la oferta O y recompensa EP a B de acuerdo con su estrategia (ver subsección 3.3). Cuando B recibe la propuesta de A, utiliza su función de utilidad para evaluarla. Si es más bajo que su utilidad reservada, el proveedor termina la negociación. De lo contrario, si UB (O, EP, T) ≥ Ub (O, EP, T + 1) es decir, la utilidad de O y EP propuesta por A en el tiempo T es mayor que la utilidad de oferta O y recompensa EP que B propondráPara A en el tiempo t + 1, B aceptará esta oferta y recompensa. La negociación se completa. Sin embargo, si UB (O, EP, T) <ub (O, EP, T + 1), B rechazará como propuesta y propondrá su contrateralidad y recompensa a A. Cuando A recibe una contraoferta y recompensa BS, A los evalúa utilizando su función de utilidad y compara la utilidad con la utilidad de oferta y recompensa que quiere proponer que b en el momento t+2, decida aceptarla o dar su contraprodice-Oferta y recompensa. Este proceso de negociación continúa y en cada ronda de negociación, los proveedores de contexto admiten para llegar al acuerdo. La negociación se terminará con éxito cuando se llega a un acuerdo, o se cancele por la fuerza debido a la fecha límite o la utilidad inferior a la utilidad reservada. Cuando la negociación se ve obligada a terminar, el gerente de contexto le pedirá a A y B que calcule UA C (A), UA C (B), UB C (A) y UB C (B) respectivamente. Si UA C (A) + UB C (A)> UA C (B) + UB C (B) Manager de contexto, deje que A proporcione un contexto. Si UA C (A) + UB C (A) <UA C (B) + UB C (B), B obtendrá el derecho de proporcionar información de contexto. Cuando UA C (A) + UB C (A) = UA C (B) + UB C (B) Manager de contexto seleccionará un proveedor de A y B al azar. Además, Context Manager asigna los ingresos entre los dos proveedores. Aunque podemos seleccionar un proveedor cuando la negociación se termina por la fuerza, sin embargo, esto puede conducir a la asignación injusta de los ingresos. Además, los negociadores más tiempo cuestan en la negociación, se darán menos ganancias. Por lo tanto, los negociadores intentarán llegar a un acuerdo lo antes posible para evitar pérdidas innecesarias. Cuando se termina la negociación, el proveedor elegido proporciona la información de contexto al gerente de contexto que entregará la información a la aplicación actual. Según la información de comentarios de las aplicaciones sobre este contexto, el gerente de contexto actualiza la reputación de los proveedores almacenada en reputación de proveedores de contexto. La reputación de los proveedores puede mejorarse o disminuir. Además, de acuerdo con los comentarios y el tiempo de negociación, el gerente de contexto dará ganancias al proveedor. Luego, el proveedor compartirá los ingresos con su oponente de acuerdo con el resultado de la negociación y la recompensa confirmada en el último proceso de negociación. Por ejemplo, en el último proceso de negociación prometió dar recompensa EP (0 ≤ ep <1) a B, y como la parte de los ingresos es P en la negociación actual. Entonces, como la porción real de los ingresos es P · (1 - EP), y su parte oponente BS de los ingresos es 1 - P+P · EP.3.3 Estrategia de negociación El proveedor de contexto puede querer perseguir el derecho a proporcionar información de contexto a ciegas para mejorar su reputación. Sin embargo, cuando finalmente proporciona información de contexto mala, su reputación disminuirá y los ingresos también son muy pequeños. Por lo tanto, el proveedor de contexto debe tomar medidas de acuerdo con su estrategia. El objetivo de la estrategia de negociación de proveedores es determinar el mejor curso de acción que resultará en un resultado de negociación que maximice su función de utilidad (es decir, cómo generar una oferta y una recompensa). En nuestro modelo de negociación, el proveedor de contexto genera su oferta y recompensa de acuerdo con su oferta y recompensa permeables y la última enviada por su oponente. Al comienzo de la negociación, los proveedores de contexto inicializan sus ofertas y recompensas de acuerdo con sus creencias y su utilidad reservada. Si el proveedor de contexto, considera que puede proporcionar un buen contexto y quiere mejorar la reputación, entonces propondrá que A proporciona información de contexto, comparte algunos ingresos con su oponente B e incluso promete dar recompensa. Sin embargo, si A considera que puede proporcionar un mal contexto, A propondrá que su oponente B proporcione el contexto y requiere que B comparta algunos ingresos y proporcione recompensa. Durante el proceso de negociación, suponemos que en el momento t a un propone la oferta OT y la recompensa EPT a B, en el tiempo t+1, B propone contraria a la contraria+1 y recompensa EPT+1 a A. Luego, en el momento t + 2, cuando la utilidad de la propuesta BS es mayor que la utilidad reservada, A da su respuesta. Ahora calculamos la utilidad esperada que se admite en el momento t +2, usamos Cu para expresar la utilidad concedida. Cu = (UA (OT, EPT, T) - UA (OT+1, EPT+1, T+1)) · CA (T+2) (UA (OT, EPT, T)> UA (OT+1,EPT + 1, T + 1), de lo contrario, A aceptará la propuesta BS) donde ca: t → [0, 1] es una función monótona.Ca (t) indica como la tasa de concesión de utilidad1. Un concede un poco al principio antes de conceder significativamente hacia la fecha límite. Luego, A genera su oferta OT+2 = (CT+2, PT+2) y recompensa EPT+2 en el tiempo t+2. La utilidad esperada de A en el tiempo t+2 es: UA (OT+2, EPT+2, T+2) = UA (OT, EPT, T+2) - CU si UA (OT+2, EPT+2,t+2) ≤ UA (OT+1, EPT+1, T+1) Entonces A aceptará la propuesta BS (es decir, OT+1 y EPT+1). De lo contrario, A propondrá su contraoferta y recompensa basadas en CU. Suponemos que Cu se distribuye uniformemente en C, P y EP (es decir, la utilidad que se admitirá en C, P y EP es 1 3 Cu respectivamente). If | ua c (ct) - (ua c (ct) - 1 3 cu ΔA (t+2)) |≤ | ua c (ct+1) - (ua c (ct) - 1 3 cu ΔA (t+2)) |es decir, la utilidad esperada de C en el tiempo T+2 es Ua C (CT) - 1 3 Cu ΔA (T+2) y está más cerca de la utilidad de AS CT en el tiempo t, luego en el tiempo t+2, CT+2 = CT, de lo contrario, la utilidad está más cerca de Bproposal CT+1 y CT+2 = CT+1. Cuando CT+2 es igual a CT, la utilidad concedida real de C es 0, y la concesión total de P y EP es Cu. Dividimos la concesión total de P y EP de manera uniforme, y obtenemos la utilidad concedida de P y EP respectivamente. Calculamos PT+2 y EPT+2 de la siguiente manera: PT+2 = (UA P) −1 (UA P (PT) - 1 2 Cu ΔA (T+2)) EPT+2 = (UA EP) −1 (UA EP (EPT) - 1 2 CU ΔA (t+2)) Cuando CT+2 es igual a CT+1, la utilidad concedida real de C es | UA C (CT+2) - Ua C (CT) |,La concesión total de P y EP es Cu ΔA (T+2) - | UA C (CT+2) - UA C (CT) |, entonces: PT+2 = (UA P) −1 (UA P (PT)- 1 2 (Cu ΔA (T+2) - | UA C (CT+2) −UA C (CT) |)) EPT+2 = (UA EP) −1 (UA EP (EPT) −1 2 (Cu (CUΔA (t+2) - | ua c (ct+2) −ua c (ct) |)) Ahora, hemos generado la oferta y la recompensa a propondrá en el momento t+2. Del mismo modo, B también puede generar su oferta y recompensa.1 Por ejemplo, Ca (T) = (T TDeadline) 1 β (0 <β <1) función de utilidad y peso de C, P y EP UC, W1 UP, W2 UEP, W3 A 0.5 (1 - Da 500) +0.5RepA 1000, 0.6 0.9p, 0.3 0.9ep, 0.1 b 0.52 (1 - dB 500) + 0.48Repb 1000, 0.5 0.9p, 0.45 0.8ep, 0.05 Tabla 1: Funciones de utilidad y pesos de C, P y EP para cada uno para cada uno para cada uno para cada unoProveedor 4. Evaluación En esta sección, evaluamos la efectividad de nuestro enfoque mediante experimentos simulados. Los proveedores de contexto A y B negocian para llegar al acuerdo. Obtienen requisitos de QOC y calculan la distancia entre los requisitos de QOC y sus QOC. Para simplificar, en nuestros experimentos, suponemos que la distancia se ha calculado, y DA representa la distancia entre los requisitos de QOC y como QOC, DB representa la distancia entre los requisitos QOC y BS QOC. El dominio de DA y DB es [0,500]. Suponemos que el valor de reputación es un número real y su dominio es [-1000, 1000], RepA representa como valor de reputación y REPB representa el valor de reputación de BS. Suponemos que ambos proveedores prestan la mayor atención a los intereses de los sistemas y prestan la menor atención a la recompensa, por lo tanto, W1> W2> W3, y el peso de UD se aproxima al peso de UREP. Las funciones de utilidad A y BS de C, P y EP se definen en la Tabla 1. Establecimos la fecha límite TDeadline = 100, y definimos la función de descuento de tiempo δ (t) y la función de la velocidad de concesión C (t) de A y B de la siguiente manera: ΔA (t) = 0.9t Δb (t) = 0.88t Ca (t) = =(T TDeadline) 1 0.8 CB (t) = (t tdeadline) 1 0.6 dados diferentes valores de DA, DB, REPA y REPB, A y B negocian para llegar a un acuerdo. El proveedor que inicia la negociación se elige al azar. Esperamos que cuando DA DB y Repa Repb, A obtengan el derecho de proporcionar contexto y obtener una parte importante de los ingresos, y cuando ∆D = DA-DB está en un rango pequeño (por ejemplo, [-50,50]) y∆REP = REPA-REPB está en un rango pequeño (por ejemplo, [-50,50]), A y B obtendrán aproximadamente la igualdad de oportunidades para proporcionar contexto y asignarán los ingresos de manera uniforme. Cuando DA -DB 500 se aproxima a DA -DB 1000 (es decir, las habilidades de dos proveedores para proporcionar información de contexto son aproximadamente iguales), también esperamos que A y B obtengan la igualdad de oportunidades para proporcionar contexto y asignar los ingresos de manera uniforme. Según las tres situaciones anteriores, hacemos tres experimentos de la siguiente manera: Experimento 1: En este experimento, A y B negocian entre sí durante 50 veces, y en cada momento, asignamos diferentes valores a Da, DB, Repa, RepB (Satisfacer DA DB y Repa Repb) y las utilidades reservadas de A y B. Cuando se completa el experimento, encontramos que 3 juegos de negociación terminan debido a la utilidad inferior a la utilidad reservada. A obtiene el derecho de proporcionar contexto durante 47 veces. La porción promedio de los ingresos A Get es de aproximadamente 0.683, y la porción promedio de ingresos de BS es 0.317. El costo de tiempo promedio para llegar al acuerdo es de 8.4. También encontramos que cuando B le pide a A que proporcione contexto en su primera oferta, B puede requerir y obtener más porción de los ingresos debido a su buena voluntad. Experimento 2: A y B también negocian entre sí durante 50 veces en este experimento dados valores diferentes de DA, DB, RepA, REPB (satisfactorio −50 ≤ ∆D = Da - DB ≤ 50 y −50 ≤ ∆rep = Drep -drep ≤ 50) y las utilidades reservadas de A y B. Después del experimento, encontramos que hay 8 juegos de negociación terminados debido a la utilidad inferior a la utilidad reservada. A y B obtienen el derecho de proporcionar contexto durante 20 veces y 22 veces respectivamente. La porción promedio de los ingresos A Get es 0.528 y la porción promedio de BS de los ingresos es 0.472. El costo de tiempo promedio en la negociación es de 10.5. Experimento 3: En este experimento, A y B también negocian entre sí durante 50 veces dados DA, DB, RepA, REPB (satisfactorio −0.2 ≤ DA - DB 500 - DA - DB 1000 ≤ 0.2) y las utilidades reservadas de A yB. Hay 6 juegos de negociación terminados por la fuerza. A y B obtienen el derecho de proporcionar contexto por 21 veces y 23 veces respectivamente. La porción promedio de los ingresos A Get es 0.481 y la porción promedio de BS de los ingresos es 0.519. El costo de tiempo promedio en la negociación es de 9.2. Una cosa debe mencionarse es que, excepto D, REP, P y EP, otros factores (por ejemplo, pesos, función de descuento de tiempo δ (t) y función de tasa de concesión C (t)) también podrían afectar el resultado de la negociación. Estos factores deben ajustarse de acuerdo con las creencias de los proveedores al comienzo de cada proceso de negociación. En nuestros experimentos, por similitud, les asignamos valores sin ninguna particularidad de antemano. Estos resultados de experimentos demuestran que nuestro enfoque puede elegir un proveedor de contexto apropiado y puede proporcionar una asignación de ingresos relativamente justos. Cuando un proveedor es obviamente más apropiado que el otro proveedor, el proveedor obtendrá el derecho de proporcionar contexto y obtener una parte importante de los ingresos. Cuando ambos proveedores tienen las habilidades aproximadamente las mismas para proporcionar contexto, sus oportunidades de proporcionar contexto son iguales y pueden obtener aproximadamente una media parte de los ingresos respectivamente.5. Trabajo relacionado en [4], Huebscher y McCann han propuesto un diseño de middleware adaptativo para aplicaciones con contexto. Su middleware adaptativo utiliza funciones de utilidad para elegir el mejor proveedor de contexto (dados los requisitos QOC de las aplicaciones y el QOC de medios alternativos de adquisición de contexto). En nuestro modelo de negociación, el cálculo de la función de utilidad UC se inspiró en este enfoque. Henricksen e Indulska proponen un enfoque para modelar y usar información imperfecta en [3]. Caracterizan varios tipos y fuentes de información de contexto imperfecta y presentan un conjunto de nuevas construcciones de modelado de contexto. También describen una infraestructura de software que respalda la gestión y el uso de información de contexto imperfecta. Judd y Steenkiste en [5] describen una interfaz genérica para consultar los servicios de contexto que permite a los clientes especificar sus requisitos de calidad como límites de precisión, confianza, tiempo de actualización e intervalo de muestra. En [6], Lei et al.Presente un servicio de contexto que acepta la frescura y la confianza metadatos de fuentes de contexto, y pasa esto a los clientes para que puedan ajustar su nivel de confianza en consecuencia.[10] presenta un marco para realizar la gestión de consistencia de contexto dinámico. El marco admite la detección de inconsistencia basada en un modelo de desencadenación de coincidencia semántica e inconsistencia, y una resolución de inconsistencia con acciones proactivas a fuentes de contexto. La mayoría de los enfoques para proporcionar un contexto apropiado utilizan un árbitro centralizado. En nuestro enfoque, dejamos que los proveedores de contexto distribuidos decidan quién puede proporcionar información de contexto adecuada. Nuestro enfoque puede reducir la carga del middleware, porque no necesitamos el middleware para proporcionar un mecanismo de selección de contexto. Puede evitar las graves consecuencias causadas por un desglose del árbitro. Además, puede garantizar los intereses de los proveedores de contexto.6. Conclusión y trabajo futuro Cómo proporcionar la información de contexto apropiada es un problema desafiante en la informática generalizada. En este artículo, hemos presentado un enfoque novedoso basado en la negociación con recompensas para intentar resolver tal problema. Los proveedores de contexto distribuidos negocian entre sí para llegar a un acuerdo sobre los temas que pueden proporcionar el contexto apropiado y cómo asignan los ingresos. Los resultados de nuestros experimentos han demostrado que nuestro enfoque puede elegir un proveedor de contexto apropiado y también puede garantizar los intereses de los proveedores mediante una asignación de ingresos relativamente justos. En este documento, solo consideramos cómo elegir un proveedor de contexto apropiado de dos proveedores. En el trabajo futuro, este modelo de negociación se extenderá, y más de dos proveedores de contexto pueden negociar entre sí para decidir quién es el proveedor de contexto más apropiado. En el modelo de negociación extendido, cómo diseñar estrategias de negociación eficientes será un problema desafiante. Suponemos que el proveedor de contexto cumplirá su promesa de recompensa en el próximo proceso de negociación. De hecho, el proveedor de contexto podría engañar a su oponente y proporcionar una promesa ilusora. Deberíamos resolver este problema en el futuro. También debemos tratar las interacciones que se interrumpen al fallar los enlaces de comunicación en el trabajo futuro.7.

        "Rewards-Based Negotiation for Providing Context Information Bing Shi State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology NanJing University NanJing, China shibing@ics.nju.edu.cn Xianping Tao State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology NanJing University NanJing, China txp@ics.nju.edu.cn Jian Lu State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology NanJing University NanJing, China lj@nju.edu.cn ABSTRACT How to provide appropriate context information is a challenging problem in context-aware computing.",
        "Most existing approaches use a centralized selection mechanism to decide which context information is appropriate.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on negotiation with rewards to solving such problem.",
        "Distributed context providers negotiate with each other to decide who can provide context and how they allocate proceeds.",
        "In order to support our approach, we have designed a concrete negotiation model with rewards.",
        "We also evaluate our approach and show that it indeed can choose an appropriate context provider and allocate the proceeds fairly.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Distributed Systems]: Distributed applicationsproviding context information General Terms Context 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Context-awareness is a key concept in pervasive computing.",
        "Context informs both recognition and mapping by providing a structured, unified view of the world in which the system operates [1].",
        "Context-aware applications exploit context information, such as location, preferences of users and so on, to adapt their behaviors in response to changing requirements of users and pervasive environments.",
        "However, one specific kind of context can often be provided by different context providers (sensors or other data sources of context information) with different quality levels.",
        "For example, in a smart home, thermometer As measurement precision is 0.1 ◦ C, and thermometer Bs measurement precision is 0.5 ◦ C. Thus A could provide more precise context information about temperature than B.",
        "Moreover, sometimes different context providers may provide conflictive context information.",
        "For example, different sensors report that the same person is in different places at the same time.",
        "Because context-aware applications utilize context information to adapt their behaviors, inappropriate context information may lead to inappropriate behavior.",
        "Thus we should design a mechanism to provide appropriate context information for current context-aware applications.",
        "In pervasive environments, context providers considered as relatively independent entities, have their own interests.",
        "They hope to get proceeds when they provide context information.",
        "However, most existing approaches consider context providers as entities without any personal interests, and use a centralized arbitrator provided by the middleware to decide who can provide appropriate context.",
        "Thus the burden of the middleware is very heavy, and its decision may be unfair and harm some providers interests.",
        "Moreover, when such arbitrator is broken down, it will cause serious consequences for context-aware applications.",
        "In this paper, we let distributed context providers themselves decide who provide context information.",
        "Since high reputation could help providers get more opportunities to provide context and get more proceeds in the future, providers try to get the right to provide good context to enhance their reputation.",
        "In order to get such right, context providers may agree to share some portion of the proceeds with its opponents.",
        "Thus context providers negotiate with each other to reach agreement on the issues who can provide context and how they allocate the proceeds.",
        "Our approach has some specific advantages: 1.",
        "We do not need an arbitrator provided by the middleware of pervasive computing to decide who provides context.",
        "Thus it will reduce the burden of the middleware. 2.",
        "It is more reasonable that distributed context providers decide who provide context, because it can avoid the serious consequences caused by a breakdown of a centralized arbitrator. 3.",
        "It can guarantee providers interests and provide fair proceeds allocation when providers negotiate with each other to reach agreement on their concerned problems. 4.",
        "This approach can choose an appropriate provider automatically.",
        "It does not need any applications and users intervention.",
        "The negotiation model we have designed to support our approach is also a novel model in negotiation domain.",
        "This model can help negotiators reach agreement in the present negotiation process by providing some guarantees over the outcome of next negotiation process (i.e. rewards).",
        "Negotiator may find current offer and reward worth more than counter-offer which will delay the agreement, and accepts current offer and reward.",
        "Without the reward, it may find current offer worth less than the counter-offer, and proposes its counter-offer.",
        "It will cost more time to reach agreement.",
        "It also expands the negotiation space considered in present negotiation process, and therefore provides more possibilities to find better agreement.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents some assumptions.",
        "Section 3 describes our approach based on negotiation detailedly, including utility functions, negotiation protocol and context providers strategies.",
        "Section 4 evaluates our approach.",
        "In section 5 we introduce some related work and conclude in section 6. 2.",
        "SOME ASSUMPTIONS Before introducing our approach, we would like to give some assumptions: 1.",
        "All context providers are well-meaning and honest.",
        "During the negotiation process, they exchange information honestly.",
        "Rewards confirmed in this negotiation process will be fulfilled in the next negotiation process. 2.",
        "All providers must guarantee the systems interests.",
        "They should provide appropriate context information for current applications.",
        "After guaranteeing the systems interest, they can try to maximize their own personal interests.",
        "The assumption is reasonable, because when an inappropriate context provider gets the right to provide bad context, as a punishment, its reputation will decrease, and the proceeds is also very small. 3.",
        "As context providers are independent, factors which influence their negotiation stance and behavior are private and not available to their opponents.",
        "Their utility functions are also private. 4.",
        "Since the negotiation takes place in pervasive environments, time is a critical factors.",
        "The current application often hopes to get context information as quickly as possible, so the time cost to reach agreement should be as short as possible.",
        "Context providers often have strict deadline by when the negotiation must be completed.",
        "After presenting these assumptions, we will propose our approach based on negotiation with rewards in the next section. 3.",
        "OUR APPROACH In the beginning, we introduce the concepts of reputation and Quality of Context (QoC) attributes.",
        "Both will be used in our approach.",
        "Reputation of an agent is a perception regarding its behavior norms, which is held by other agents, based on experiences and observation of its past actions [7].",
        "Here agent means context provider.",
        "Each providers reputation indicates its historical ability to provide appropriate context information.",
        "Quality of Context (QoC) attributes characterize the quality of context information.",
        "When applications require context information, they should specify their QoC requirements which express constraints of QoC attributes.",
        "Context providers can specify QoC attributes for the context information they deliver.",
        "Although we can decide who provides appropriate context according to QoC requirements and context providers QoC information, applications QoC requirements might not reflect the actual quality requirements.",
        "Thus, in addition to QoC, reputation information of context providers is another factor affecting the decision who can provide context information.",
        "Negotiation is a process by which a joint decision is made by two or more parties.",
        "The parties first verbalize contradictory demands and then move towards agreement by a process of concession making or search for new alternatives [2].",
        "In pervasive environments, all available context providers negotiate with each other to decide who can provide context information.",
        "This process will be repeated because a kind of context is needed more than one time.",
        "Negotiation using persuasive arguments (such as threats, promises of future rewards, and appeals) allows negotiation parties to influence each others preferences to reach better deals effectively and efficiently [9].",
        "This pervasive negotiation is effective in repeated interaction because arguments can be constructed to directly impact future encounters.",
        "In this paper, for simplicity, we let negotiation take place between two providers.",
        "We extend Raiffas basic model for bilateral negotiation [8], and allow negotiators to negotiate with each other by exchanging arguments in the form of promises of future rewards or requests for future rewards.",
        "Rewards mean some extra proceeds in the next negotiation process.",
        "They can influence outcomes of current and future negotiation.",
        "In our approach, as described by Figure 1, the current application requires Context Manager to provide a specific type of context information satisfying QoC requirements.",
        "Context Manager finds that provider A and B can provide such kind of context with different quality levels.",
        "Then the manager tells A and B to negotiate to reach agreement on who can provide the context information and how they will allocate the proceeds.",
        "Both providers get reputation information from the database Reputation of Context Providers and QoC requirements, and then negotiate with each other according to our negotiation model.",
        "When negotiation is completed, the chosen provider will provide the context information to Context Manager, and then Context Manager delivers such information to the application and also stores it in Context Knowledge Base where current and historical context information is stored.",
        "The current application gives the feedback information about the provided context, and then Context Manager will update the chosen providers reputation information according to the feedback information.",
        "Context Manager also provides the proceeds to providers according to the feedback information and the time cost on negotiation.",
        "In the following parts of this section, we describe our negotiation model in detail, including context providers utility functions to evaluate offers and rewards, negotiation protocol, and strategies to generate offers and rewards.",
        "Context Knowledge Base Reputation of Context Providers Context provider A Context Manager Negotiate Applications QoC requirements and feedback Provide QoC requirements and proceeds Manage Context Provide Context Getreputation Getreputation Update reputation information according to feedback Context provider B Figure 1: Negotiate to provide appropriate context information. 3.1 Utility function During the negotiation process, one provider proposes an offer and a reward to the other provider.",
        "An offer is noted as o = (c, p): c indicates the chosen context provider and its domain is Dc (i.e. the two context providers participating in the negotiation); p means the proposers portion of the proceeds, and its domain is Dp = [0,1].",
        "Its opponents portion of the proceeds is 1−p.",
        "The reward eps domain is Dep = [-1,1], and |ep| means the extra portion of proceeds the proposer promises to provide or requests in the next negotiation process. ep < 0 means the proposer promises to provide reward, ep > 0 means the proposer requests reward and ep =0 means no reward.",
        "The opponent evaluates the offer and reward to decide to accept them or propose a counter-offer and a reward.",
        "Thus context providers should have utility functions to evaluate offers and rewards.",
        "Time is a critical factor, and only at times in the set T = {0, 1, 2, . . . tdeadline}, context providers can propose their offers.",
        "The set O include all available offers.",
        "Context provider As utility function of the offer and reward at time t UA : O × Dep × T → [−1, 1] is defined as: UA(o,ep,t)=(wA 1 ·UA c (c)+wA 2 ·UA p (p)+wA 3 ·UA ep(ep))·δA(t) (1) Similarly, the utility function of As opponent (i.e.",
        "B) can be defined as: UB(o,ep,t)=(wB 1 ·UB c (c)+wB 2 ·UB p (1−p)+wB 3 ·UB ep(−ep))·δB(t) In (1), wA 1 , wA 2 and wA 3 are weights given to c, p and ep respectively, and wA 1 + wA 2 + wA 3 =1.",
        "Usually, the context provider pays the most attention to the systems interests, pays the least attention to the reward, thus wA 1 > wA 2 > wA 3 .",
        "UA c : Dc → [−1, 1] is the utility function of the issue who provides context.",
        "This function is determined by two factors: the distance between cs QoC and current applications QoC requirements, and cs reputation.",
        "The two negotiators acquire cs QoC information from c, and we use the approach proposed in [4] to calculate the distance between cs QoC and the applications Qoc requirements.",
        "The required context has n QoC attributes and let the applications wishes for this context be a = (a1, a2 . . . an) (where ai = means the applications indifference to the i-th QoC attribute), cs QoC attributes cp = (cp1, cp2 . . . cpn) (where cpi = means cs inability to provide a quantitative value for the i-th QoC attribute).",
        "Because numerical distance values of different properties are combined, e.g. location precision in metres with refresh rate in Hz, thus a standard scale for all dimension is needed.",
        "The scaling factors for the QoC attributes are s = (s1, s2 . . . sn).",
        "In addition, different QoC attributes may have different weights: w = (w1, w2 . . . wn).",
        "Then d = (d1, d2 . . . dn) di = (cpi − ai) · si · wi where cpi−ai = 0 for ai = and cpi−ai = o(ai) for cpi = ( o(.) determines the applications satisfaction or dissatisfaction when c is unable to provide an estimate of a QoC attribute, given the value wished for by the application).",
        "The distance can be linear distance (1-norm), Euclidean distance (2-norm), or the maximum distance (max-norm): |d| = |d1| + |d2| + . . . + |dn| (1 − norm) ||d||2 = |d1|2 + |d2|2 + . . . + |dn|2 (2 − norm) ||d||∞ = max{|d1|, |d2| . . . |dn|} (max − norm) The detail description of this calculation can be found in [4].",
        "Reputation of c can be acquired from the database Reputation of Context Providers.",
        "UA c (c) : R × Drep → [−1, 1] can be defined as: UA c (c) = wA c1 · UA d (d) + wA c2 · UA rep(rep) wA c1 and wA c2 are weights given to the distance and reputation respectively, and wA c1 + wA c2 = 1.",
        "Drep is the domain of reputation information.",
        "UA d : R → [0, 1] is a monotonedecreasing function and UA rep : Drep → [−1, 1] is a monotoneincreasing function.",
        "UA p : Dp → [0, 1] is the utility function of the portion of proceeds A will receive and it is also a monotone-increasing function.",
        "As utility function of reward ep UA ep : Dep → [−1, 1] is also a monotone-increasing function and UA ep(0) = 0. δA : T → [0, 1] is the time discount function.",
        "It is also a monotone-decreasing function.",
        "When time t cost on negotiation increases, δA(t) will decrease, and the utility will also decrease.",
        "Thus both negotiators want to reach agreement as quickly as possible to avoid loss of utility. 3.2 Negotiation protocol When provider A and B have got QoC requirements and reputation information, they begin to negotiate.",
        "They first set their reserved (the lowest acceptable) utility which can guarantee the systems interests and their personal interests.",
        "When the context provider finds the utility of an offer and a reward is lower than its reserved utility, it will reject this proposal and terminate the negotiation process.",
        "The provider who starts the negotiation is chosen randomly.",
        "We assume A starts the negotiation, and it proposes offer o and reward ep to B according to its strategy (see subsection 3.3).",
        "When B receives the proposal from A, it uses its utility function to evaluate it.",
        "If it is lower than its reserved utility, the provider terminates the negotiation.",
        "Otherwise, if UB(o, ep, t) ≥ UB(o , ep , t + 1) i.e. the utility of o and ep proposed by A at time t is greater than the utility of offer o and reward ep which B will propose to A at time t + 1, B will accept this offer and reward.",
        "The negotiation is completed.",
        "However, if UB(o, ep, t) < UB(o , ep , t + 1) then B will reject As proposal, and propose its counter-offer and reward to A.",
        "When A receives Bs counter-offer and reward, A evaluates them using its utility function, and compares the utility with the utility of offer and reward it wants to propose to B at time t+2, decides to accept it or give its counter-offer and reward.",
        "This negotiation process continues and in each negotiation round, context providers concede in order to reach agreement.",
        "The negotiation will be successfully finished when agreement is reached, or be terminated forcibly due to deadline or the utility lower than reserved utility.",
        "When negotiation is forced to be terminated, Context manager will ask A and B to calculate UA c (A), UA c (B), UB c (A) and UB c (B) respectively.",
        "If UA c (A) + UB c (A) > UA c (B) + UB c (B) Context Manager let A provide context.",
        "If UA c (A) + UB c (A) < UA c (B) + UB c (B) then B will get the right to provide context information.",
        "When UA c (A) + UB c (A) = UA c (B) + UB c (B) Context Manager will select a provider from A and B randomly.",
        "In addition, Context Manager allocates the proceeds between the two providers.",
        "Although we can select one provider when negotiation is terminated forcibly, however, this may lead to the unfair allocation of the proceeds.",
        "Moreover, more time negotiators cost on negotiation, less proceeds will be given.",
        "Thus negotiators will try to reach agreement as soon as possible in order to avoid unnecessary loss.",
        "When the negotiation is finished, the chosen provider provides the context information to Context Manager which will deliver the information to current application.",
        "According to the applications feedback information about this context, Context Manager updates the providers reputation stored in Reputation of Context Providers.",
        "The providers reputation may be enhanced or decreased.",
        "In addition, according to the feedback and the negotiation time, Context Manager will give proceeds to the provider.",
        "Then the provider will share the proceeds with its opponent according to the negotiation outcome and the reward confirmed in the last negotiation process.",
        "For example, in the last negotiation process A promised to give reward ep (0 ≤ ep < 1) to B, and As portion of the proceeds is p in current negotiation.",
        "Then As actual portion of the proceeds is p · (1 − ep), and its opponent Bs portion of the proceeds is 1−p+p·ep. 3.3 Negotiation strategy The context provider might want to pursue the right to provide context information blindly in order to enhance its reputation.",
        "However when it finally provides bad context information, its reputation will be decreased and the proceeds is also very small.",
        "Thus the context provider should take action according to its strategy.",
        "The aim of providers negotiation strategy is to determine the best course of action which will result in a negotiation outcome maximizing its utility function (i.e how to generate an offer and a reward).",
        "In our negotiation model, the context provider generates its offer and reward according to its pervious offer and reward and the last one sent by its opponent.",
        "At the beginning of the negotiation, context providers initialize their offers and rewards according to their beliefs and their reserved utility.",
        "If context provider A considers that it can provide good context and wants to enhance reputation, then it will propose that A provides the context information, shares some proceeds with its opponent B, and even promises to give reward.",
        "However, if A considers that it may provide bad context, A will propose that its opponent B provide the context, and require B to share some proceeds and provide reward.",
        "During the negotiation process, we assume that at time t A proposes offer ot and reward ept to B, at time t + 1, B proposes counter-offer ot+1 and reward ept+1 to A.",
        "Then at time t + 2, when the utility of Bs proposal is greater than As reserved utility, A gives its response.",
        "Now we calculate the expected utility to be conceded at time t +2, we use Cu to express the conceded utility.",
        "Cu = (UA(ot, ept, t) − UA(ot+1, ept+1, t + 1)) · cA(t + 2) (UA(ot, ept, t) > UA(ot+1, ept+1, t + 1), otherwise, A will accept Bs proposal) where cA : T → [0, 1] is a monotoneincreasing function. cA(t) indicates As utility concession rate1 .",
        "A concedes a little in the beginning before conceding significantly towards the deadline.",
        "Then A generates its offer ot+2 = (ct+2, pt+2) and reward ept+2 at time t + 2.",
        "The expected utility of A at time t + 2 is: UA(ot+2, ept+2, t + 2) = UA(ot, ept, t + 2) − Cu If UA(ot+2, ept+2, t + 2) ≤ UA(ot+1, ept+1, t + 1) then A will accept Bs proposal (i.e. ot+1 and ept+1).",
        "Otherwise, A will propose its counter-offer and reward based on Cu.",
        "We assume that Cu is distributed evenly on c, p and ep (i.e. the utility to be conceded on c, p and ep is 1 3 Cu respectively).",
        "If |UA c (ct)−(UA c (ct)− 1 3 Cu δA(t+2) )| ≤ |UA c (ct+1)−(UA c (ct)− 1 3 Cu δA(t+2) )| i.e. the expected utility of c at time t+2 is UA c (ct)− 1 3 Cu δA(t+2) and it is closer to the utility of As proposal ct at time t, then at time t + 2, ct+2 = ct, else the utility is closer to Bproposal ct+1 and ct+2 = ct+1.",
        "When ct+2 is equal to ct, the actual conceded utility of c is 0, and the total concession of p and ep is Cu.",
        "We divide the total concession of p and ep evenly, and get the conceded utility of p and ep respectively.",
        "We calculate pt+2 and ept+2 as follows: pt+2 = (UA p )−1 (UA p (pt) − 1 2 Cu δA(t + 2) ) ept+2 = (UA ep)−1 (UA ep(ept) − 1 2 Cu δA(t + 2) ) When ct+2 is equal to ct+1, the actual conceded utility of c is |UA c (ct+2) − UA c (ct)|, the total concession of p and ep is Cu δA(t+2) − |UA c (ct+2) − UA c (ct)|, then: pt+2 = (UA p )−1 (UA p (pt)− 1 2 ( Cu δA(t + 2) −|UA c (ct+2)−UA c (ct)|)) ept+2 = (UA ep)−1 (UA ep(ept)−1 2 ( Cu δA(t+2) −|UA c (ct+2)−UA c (ct)|)) Now, we have generated the offer and reward A will propose at time t + 2.",
        "Similarly, B also can generate its offer and reward. 1 For example, cA(t) = ( t tdeadline ) 1 β (0 < β < 1) Utility function and weight of c, p and ep Uc, w1 Up, w2 Uep, w3 A 0.5(1 − dA 500 ) + 0.5repA 1000 , 0.6 0.9p, 0.3 0.9ep, 0.1 B 0.52(1 − dB 500 ) + 0.48repB 1000 , 0.5 0.9p, 0.45 0.8ep, 0.05 Table 1: Utility functions and weights of c, p and ep for each provider 4.",
        "EVALUATION In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by simulated experiments.",
        "Context providers A and B negotiate to reach agreement.",
        "They get QoC requirements and calculate the distance between Qoc requirements and their QoC.",
        "For simplicity, in our experiments, we assume that the distance has been calculated, and dA represents distance between QoC requirements and As QoC, dB represents distance between QoC requirements and Bs QoC.",
        "The domain of dA and dB is [0,500].",
        "We assume reputation value is a real number and its domain is [-1000, 1000], repA represents As reputation value and repB represents Bs reputation value.",
        "We assume that both providers pay the most attention to the systems interests, and pay the least attention to the reward, thus w1 > w2 > w3, and the weight of Ud approximates the weight of Urep.",
        "A and Bs utility functions and weights of c, p and ep are defined in Table 1.",
        "We set deadline tdeadline = 100, and define time discount function δ(t) and concession rate function c(t) of A and B as follows: δA(t) = 0.9t δB(t) = 0.88t cA(t) = ( t tdeadline ) 1 0.8 cB(t) = ( t tdeadline ) 1 0.6 Given different values of dA, dB, repA and repB, A and B negotiate to reach agreement.",
        "The provider that starts the negotiation is chosen at random.",
        "We hope that when dA dB and repA repB, A will get the right to provide context and get a major portion of the proceeds, and when ∆d = dA − dB is in a small range (e.g. [-50,50]) and ∆rep = repA − repB is in a small range (e.g. [-50,50]), A and B will get approximately equal opportunities to provide context, and allocate the proceeds evenly.",
        "When dA−dB 500 approximates to dA−dB 1000 (i.e. the two providers abilities to provide context information are approximately equal), we also hope that A and B get equal opportunities to provide context and allocate the proceeds evenly.",
        "According to the three situations above, we make three experiments as follows: Experiment 1 : In this experiment, A and B negotiate with each other for 50 times, and at each time, we assign different values to dA, dB, repA, repB (satisfying dA dB and repA repB) and the reserved utilities of A and B.",
        "When the experiment is completed, we find 3 negotiation games are terminated due to the utility lower than the reserved utility.",
        "A gets the right to provide context for 47 times.",
        "The average portion of proceeds A get is about 0.683, and Bs average portion of proceeds is 0.317.",
        "The average time cost to reach agreement is 8.4.",
        "We also find that when B asks A to provide context in its first offer, B can require and get more portion of the proceeds because of its goodwill.",
        "Experiment 2 : A and B also negotiate with each other for 50 times in this experiment given different values of dA, dB, repA, repB (satisfying −50 ≤ ∆d = dA − dB ≤ 50 and −50 ≤ ∆rep = drep −drep ≤ 50) and the reserved utilities of A and B.",
        "After the experiment, we find that there are 8 negotiation games terminated due to the utility lower than the reserved utility.",
        "A and B get the right to provide context for 20 times and 22 times respectively.",

                "Because context-aware applications utilize context information to adapt their behaviors, inappropriate context information may lead to inappropriate behavior.",

                "Thus the burden of the middleware is very heavy, and its decision may be unfair and harm some providers interests.",
                "Moreover, when such arbitrator is broken down, it will cause serious consequences for context-aware applications.",

                "Our approach has some specific advantages: 1.",

                "During the negotiation process, they exchange information honestly.",
                "Rewards confirmed in this negotiation process will be fulfilled in the next negotiation process. 2.",
                "All providers must guarantee the systems interests.",
                "They should provide appropriate context information for current applications.",
                "After guaranteeing the systems interest, they can try to maximize their own personal interests.",
                "The assumption is reasonable, because when an inappropriate context provider gets the right to provide bad context, as a punishment, its reputation will decrease, and the proceeds is also very small. 3.",
                "As context providers are independent, factors which influence their negotiation stance and behavior are private and not available to their opponents.",
                "Their utility functions are also private. 4.",
                "Since the negotiation takes place in pervasive environments, time is a critical factors.",
                "The current application often hopes to get context information as quickly as possible, so the time cost to reach agreement should be as short as possible.",
                "Context providers often have strict deadline by when the negotiation must be completed.",
                "After presenting these assumptions, we will propose our approach based on negotiation with rewards in the next section. 3.",
                "OUR APPROACH In the beginning, we introduce the concepts of reputation and Quality of Context (QoC) attributes.",
                "Both will be used in our approach.",
                "Reputation of an agent is a perception regarding its behavior norms, which is held by other agents, based on experiences and observation of its past actions [7].",
                "Here agent means context provider.",

                "Context providers can specify QoC attributes for the context information they deliver.",
                "Although we can decide who provides appropriate context according to QoC requirements and context providers QoC information, applications QoC requirements might not reflect the actual quality requirements.",
                "Thus, in addition to QoC, reputation information of context providers is another factor affecting the decision who can provide context information.",
                "Negotiation is a process by which a joint decision is made by two or more parties.",
                "The parties first verbalize contradictory demands and then move towards agreement by a process of concession making or search for new alternatives [2].",
                "In pervasive environments, all available context providers negotiate with each other to decide who can provide context information.",
                "This process will be repeated because a kind of context is needed more than one time.",
                "Negotiation using persuasive arguments (such as threats, promises of future rewards, and appeals) allows negotiation parties to influence each others preferences to reach better deals effectively and efficiently [9].",
                "This pervasive negotiation is effective in repeated interaction because arguments can be constructed to directly impact future encounters.",
                "In this paper, for simplicity, we let negotiation take place between two providers.",
                "We extend Raiffas basic model for bilateral negotiation [8], and allow negotiators to negotiate with each other by exchanging arguments in the form of promises of future rewards or requests for future rewards.",

                "For example, different sensors report that the same person is in different places at the same time.",
                "Because context-aware applications utilize context information to adapt their behaviors, inappropriate context information may lead to inappropriate behavior.",
                "Thus we should design a mechanism to provide appropriate context information for current context-aware applications.",

                "After guaranteeing the systems interest, they can try to maximize their own personal interests.",
                "The assumption is reasonable, because when an inappropriate context provider gets the right to provide bad context, as a punishment, its reputation will decrease, and the proceeds is also very small. 3.",
                "As context providers are independent, factors which influence their <br>negotiation</br> stance and behavior are private and not available to their opponents.",
                "Their utility functions are also private. 4.",

                "INTRODUCTION Context-awareness is a key concept in pervasive computing.",
                "Context informs both recognition and mapping by providing a structured, unified view of the world in which the system operates [1].",
                "Context-aware applications exploit context information, such as location, preferences of users and so on, to adapt their behaviors in response to changing requirements of users and pervasive environments.",
                "However, one specific kind of context can often be provided by different context providers (sensors or other data sources of context information) with different quality levels.",
                "For example, in a smart home, thermometer As measurement precision is 0.1 ◦ C, and thermometer Bs measurement precision is 0.5 ◦ C. Thus A could provide more precise context information about temperature than B.",
                "Moreover, sometimes different context providers may provide conflictive context information.",
                "For example, different sensors report that the same person is in different places at the same time.",
                "Because context-aware applications utilize context information to adapt their behaviors, inappropriate context information may lead to inappropriate behavior.",
                "Thus we should design a mechanism to provide appropriate context information for current context-aware applications.",
                "In pervasive environments, context providers considered as relatively independent entities, have their own interests.",
                "They hope to get proceeds when they provide context information.",
                "However, most existing approaches consider context providers as entities without any personal interests, and use a centralized arbitrator provided by the middleware to decide who can provide appropriate context.",
                "Thus the burden of the middleware is very heavy, and its decision may be unfair and harm some providers interests.",
                "Moreover, when such arbitrator is broken down, it will cause serious consequences for context-aware applications.",
                "In this paper, we let distributed context providers themselves decide who provide context information.",
                "Since high reputation could help providers get more opportunities to provide context and get more proceeds in the future, providers try to get the right to provide good context to enhance their reputation.",
                "In order to get such right, context providers may agree to share some portion of the proceeds with its opponents.",
                "Thus context providers negotiate with each other to reach agreement on the issues who can provide context and how they allocate the proceeds.",
                "Our approach has some specific advantages: 1.",
                "We do not need an arbitrator provided by the middleware of pervasive computing to decide who provides context.",

                "All providers must guarantee the systems interests.",
                "They should provide appropriate context information for current applications.",
                "After guaranteeing the systems interest, they can try to maximize their own personal interests.",
                "The assumption is reasonable, because when an inappropriate context provider gets the right to provide bad context, as a punishment, its reputation will decrease, and the proceeds is also very small. 3.",
                "As context providers are independent, factors which influence their negotiation stance and behavior are private and not available to their opponents.",
                "Their utility functions are also private. 4.",
                "Since the negotiation takes place in pervasive environments, time is a critical factors.",
                "The current application often hopes to get context information as quickly as possible, so the time cost to reach agreement should be as short as possible.",
                "Context providers often have strict deadline by when the negotiation must be completed.",
                "After presenting these assumptions, we will propose our approach based on negotiation with rewards in the next section. 3.",
                "OUR APPROACH In the beginning, we introduce the concepts of reputation and Quality of Context (QoC) attributes.",
                "Both will be used in our approach.",

                "Although we can decide who provides appropriate context according to QoC requirements and context providers QoC information, applications QoC requirements might not reflect the actual quality requirements.",
                "Thus, in addition to QoC, reputation information of context providers is another factor affecting the decision who can provide context information.",
                "Negotiation is a process by which a joint decision is made by two or more parties.",
                "The parties first verbalize contradictory demands and then move towards agreement by a process of concession making or search for new alternatives [2].",
                "In pervasive environments, all available context providers negotiate with each other to decide who can provide context information.",
                "This process will be repeated because a kind of context is needed more than one time.",
                "Negotiation using persuasive arguments (such as threats, promises of future rewards, and appeals) allows negotiation parties to influence each others preferences to reach better deals effectively and efficiently [9].",
                "This pervasive negotiation is effective in repeated interaction because arguments can be constructed to directly impact future encounters.",
                "In this paper, for simplicity, we let negotiation take place between two providers.",
                "We extend Raiffas basic model for bilateral negotiation [8], and allow negotiators to negotiate with each other by exchanging arguments in the form of promises of future rewards or requests for future rewards.",

                "They can influence outcomes of current and future negotiation.",
                "In our approach, as described by Figure 1, the current application requires Context Manager to provide a specific type of context information satisfying QoC requirements.",

                "Context-aware applications exploit context information, such as location, preferences of users and so on, to adapt their behaviors in response to changing requirements of users and pervasive environments.",
                "However, one specific kind of context can often be provided by different context providers (sensors or other data sources of context information) with different quality levels.",
                "For example, in a smart home, thermometer As measurement precision is 0.1 ◦ C, and thermometer Bs measurement precision is 0.5 ◦ C. Thus A could provide more precise context information about temperature than B.",
                "Moreover, sometimes different context providers may provide conflictive context information.",
                "For example, different sensors report that the same person is in different places at the same time.",
                "Because context-aware applications utilize context information to adapt their behaviors, inappropriate context information may lead to inappropriate behavior.",
                "Thus we should design a mechanism to provide appropriate context information for current context-aware applications.",
                "In pervasive environments, context providers considered as relatively independent entities, have their own interests.",
                "They hope to get proceeds when they provide context information.",
                "However, most existing approaches consider context providers as entities without any personal interests, and use a centralized arbitrator provided by the middleware to decide who can provide appropriate context.",
                "Thus the burden of the middleware is very heavy, and its decision may be unfair and harm some providers interests.",
                "Moreover, when such arbitrator is broken down, it will cause serious consequences for context-aware applications.",
                "In this paper, we let distributed context providers themselves decide who provide context information.",
                "Since high reputation could help providers get more opportunities to provide context and get more proceeds in the future, providers try to get the right to provide good context to enhance their reputation.",
                "In order to get such right, context providers may agree to share some portion of the proceeds with its opponents.",
                "Thus context providers negotiate with each other to reach agreement on the issues who can provide context and how they allocate the proceeds.",
                "Our approach has some specific advantages: 1.",
                "We do not need an arbitrator provided by the middleware of pervasive computing to decide who provides context.",
                "Thus it will reduce the burden of the middleware. 2.",
                "It is more reasonable that distributed context providers decide who provide context, because it can avoid the serious consequences caused by a breakdown of a centralized arbitrator. 3.",
                "It can guarantee providers interests and provide fair proceeds allocation when providers negotiate with each other to reach agreement on their concerned problems. 4.",
                "This approach can choose an appropriate provider automatically.",
                "It does not need any applications and users intervention.",
                "The negotiation model we have designed to support our approach is also a novel model in negotiation domain.",
                "This model can help negotiators reach agreement in the present negotiation process by providing some guarantees over the outcome of next negotiation process (i.e. rewards).",
                "Negotiator may find current offer and reward worth more than counter-offer which will delay the agreement, and accepts current offer and reward.",
                "Without the reward, it may find current offer worth less than the counter-offer, and proposes its counter-offer.",
                "It will cost more time to reach agreement.",
                "It also expands the negotiation space considered in present negotiation process, and therefore provides more possibilities to find better agreement.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 presents some assumptions.",
                "Section 3 describes our approach based on negotiation detailedly, including utility functions, negotiation protocol and context providers strategies.",
                "Section 4 evaluates our approach.",
                "In section 5 we introduce some related work and conclude in section 6. 2.",
                "SOME ASSUMPTIONS Before introducing our approach, we would like to give some assumptions: 1.",
                "All context providers are well-meaning and honest.",
                "During the negotiation process, they exchange information honestly.",
                "Rewards confirmed in this negotiation process will be fulfilled in the next negotiation process. 2.",
                "All providers must guarantee the systems interests.",
                "They should provide appropriate context information for current applications.",
                "After guaranteeing the systems interest, they can try to maximize their own personal interests.",
                "The assumption is reasonable, because when an inappropriate context provider gets the right to provide bad context, as a punishment, its reputation will decrease, and the proceeds is also very small. 3.",
                "As context providers are independent, factors which influence their negotiation stance and behavior are private and not available to their opponents.",
                "Their utility functions are also private. 4.",
                "Since the negotiation takes place in pervasive environments, time is a critical factors.",
                "The current application often hopes to get context information as quickly as possible, so the time cost to reach agreement should be as short as possible.",
                "Context providers often have strict deadline by when the negotiation must be completed.",
                "After presenting these assumptions, we will propose our approach based on negotiation with rewards in the next section. 3.",
                "OUR APPROACH In the beginning, we introduce the concepts of reputation and Quality of Context (QoC) attributes.",
                "Both will be used in our approach.",
                "Reputation of an agent is a perception regarding its behavior norms, which is held by other agents, based on experiences and observation of its past actions [7].",
                "Here agent means context provider.",
                "Each providers reputation indicates its historical ability to provide appropriate context information.",
                "Quality of Context (QoC) attributes characterize the quality of context information.",
                "When applications require context information, they should specify their QoC requirements which express constraints of QoC attributes.",
                "Context providers can specify QoC attributes for the context information they deliver.",
                "Although we can decide who provides appropriate context according to QoC requirements and context providers QoC information, applications QoC requirements might not reflect the actual quality requirements.",
                "Thus, in addition to QoC, reputation information of context providers is another factor affecting the decision who can provide context information.",
                "Negotiation is a process by which a joint decision is made by two or more parties.",
                "The parties first verbalize contradictory demands and then move towards agreement by a process of concession making or search for new alternatives [2].",
                "In pervasive environments, all available context providers negotiate with each other to decide who can provide context information.",
                "This process will be repeated because a kind of context is needed more than one time.",
                "Negotiation using persuasive arguments (such as threats, promises of future rewards, and appeals) allows negotiation parties to influence each others preferences to reach better deals effectively and efficiently [9].",
                "This pervasive negotiation is effective in repeated interaction because arguments can be constructed to directly impact future encounters.",
                "In this paper, for simplicity, we let negotiation take place between two providers.",
                "We extend Raiffas basic model for bilateral negotiation [8], and allow negotiators to negotiate with each other by exchanging arguments in the form of promises of future rewards or requests for future rewards.",
                "Rewards mean some extra proceeds in the next negotiation process.",
                "They can influence outcomes of current and future negotiation.",
                "In our approach, as described by Figure 1, the current application requires Context Manager to provide a specific type of context information satisfying QoC requirements.",
                "Context Manager finds that provider A and B can provide such kind of context with different quality levels.",
                "Then the manager tells A and B to negotiate to reach agreement on who can provide the context information and how they will allocate the proceeds.",
                "Both providers get reputation information from the database Reputation of Context Providers and QoC requirements, and then negotiate with each other according to our negotiation model.",
                "When negotiation is completed, the chosen provider will provide the context information to Context Manager, and then Context Manager delivers such information to the application and also stores it in Context Knowledge Base where current and historical context information is stored.",
                "The current application gives the feedback information about the provided context, and then Context Manager will update the chosen providers reputation information according to the feedback information.",
                "Context Manager also provides the proceeds to providers according to the feedback information and the time cost on negotiation.",
                "In the following parts of this section, we describe our negotiation model in detail, including context providers utility functions to evaluate offers and rewards, negotiation protocol, and strategies to generate offers and rewards.",

                "An offer is noted as o = (c, p): c indicates the chosen context provider and its domain is Dc (i.e. the two context providers participating in the negotiation); p means the proposers portion of the proceeds, and its domain is Dp = [0,1].",

                "The reward eps domain is Dep = [-1,1], and |ep| means the extra portion of proceeds the proposer promises to provide or requests in the next negotiation process. ep < 0 means the proposer promises to provide reward, ep > 0 means the proposer requests reward and ep =0 means no reward.",
                "The opponent evaluates the offer and reward to decide to accept them or propose a counter-offer and a reward.",
                "Thus context providers should have utility functions to evaluate offers and rewards.",
                "Time is a critical factor, and only at times in the set T = {0, 1, 2, . . . tdeadline}, context providers can propose their offers.",

                "Usually, the context provider pays the most attention to the systems interests, pays the least attention to the reward, thus wA 1 > wA 2 > wA 3 .",

                "The negotiation is completed.",
                "However, if UB(o, ep, t) < UB(o , ep , t + 1) then B will reject As proposal, and propose its counter-offer and reward to A.",

                "When negotiation is forced to be terminated, Context manager will ask A and B to calculate UA c (A), UA c (B), UB c (A) and UB c (B) respectively.",

                "Although we can select one provider when negotiation is terminated forcibly, however, this may lead to the unfair allocation of the proceeds.",
                "Moreover, more time negotiators cost on negotiation, less proceeds will be given.",
                "Thus negotiators will try to reach agreement as soon as possible in order to avoid unnecessary loss.",

                "For example, in the last negotiation process A promised to give reward ep (0 ≤ ep < 1) to B, and As portion of the proceeds is p in current negotiation.",
                "Then As actual portion of the proceeds is p · (1 − ep), and its opponent Bs portion of the proceeds is 1−p+p·ep. 3.3 Negotiation strategy The context provider might want to pursue the right to provide context information blindly in order to enhance its reputation.",
                "However when it finally provides bad context information, its reputation will be decreased and the proceeds is also very small.",
                "Thus the context provider should take action according to its strategy.",
                "The aim of providers negotiation strategy is to determine the best course of action which will result in a negotiation outcome maximizing its utility function (i.e how to generate an offer and a reward).",
                "In our negotiation model, the context provider generates its offer and reward according to its pervious offer and reward and the last one sent by its opponent.",
                "At the beginning of the negotiation, context providers initialize their offers and rewards according to their beliefs and their reserved utility.",
                "If context provider A considers that it can provide good context and wants to enhance reputation, then it will propose that A provides the context information, shares some proceeds with its opponent B, and even promises to give reward.",
                "However, if A considers that it may provide bad context, A will propose that its opponent B provide the context, and require B to share some proceeds and provide reward.",

                "Because context-aware applications utilize context information to adapt their behaviors, inappropriate context information may lead to inappropriate behavior.",

                "Negotiation is a process by which a joint decision is made by two or more parties.",
                "The parties first verbalize contradictory demands and then move towards agreement by a process of concession making or search for new alternatives [2].",
                "In pervasive environments, all available context providers negotiate with each other to decide who can provide context information.",
                "This process will be repeated because a kind of context is needed more than one time.",

                "All context providers are well-meaning and honest.",
                "During the negotiation process, they exchange information honestly.",
                "Rewards confirmed in this negotiation process will be fulfilled in the next negotiation process. 2.",
                "All providers must guarantee the systems interests.",
                "They should provide appropriate context information for current applications.",
                "After guaranteeing the systems interest, they can try to maximize their own personal interests.",
                "The assumption is reasonable, because when an inappropriate context provider gets the right to provide bad context, as a punishment, its reputation will decrease, and the proceeds is also very small. 3.",
                "As context providers are independent, factors which influence their negotiation stance and behavior are private and not available to their opponents.",
                "Their utility functions are also private. 4.",
                "Since the negotiation takes place in pervasive environments, time is a critical factors.",
                "The current application often hopes to get context information as quickly as possible, so the time cost to reach agreement should be as short as possible.",
                "Context providers often have strict deadline by when the negotiation must be completed.",
                "After presenting these assumptions, we will propose our approach based on negotiation with rewards in the next section. 3.",
                "OUR APPROACH In the beginning, we introduce the concepts of reputation and Quality of Context (QoC) attributes.",

                "Although we can decide who provides appropriate context according to QoC requirements and context providers QoC information, applications QoC requirements might not reflect the actual quality requirements.",
                "Thus, in addition to QoC, reputation information of context providers is another factor affecting the decision who can provide context information.",
                "Negotiation is a process by which a joint decision is made by two or more parties.",
                "The parties first verbalize contradictory demands and then move towards agreement by a process of concession making or search for new alternatives [2].",
                "In pervasive environments, all available context providers negotiate with each other to decide who can provide context information.",
                "This process will be repeated because a kind of context is needed more than one time.",
                "Negotiation using persuasive arguments (such as threats, promises of future rewards, and appeals) allows negotiation parties to influence each others preferences to reach better deals effectively and efficiently [9].",
                "This pervasive negotiation is effective in repeated interaction because arguments can be constructed to directly impact future encounters.",
                "In this paper, for simplicity, we let negotiation take place between two providers.",
                "We extend Raiffas basic model for bilateral negotiation [8], and allow negotiators to negotiate with each other by exchanging arguments in the form of promises of future rewards or requests for future rewards.",

                "For example, different sensors report that the same person is in different places at the same time.",
                "Because context-aware applications utilize context information to adapt their behaviors, inappropriate context information may lead to inappropriate behavior.",

                "Since the negotiation takes place in pervasive environments, time is a critical factors.",

                "Context informs both recognition and mapping by providing a structured, unified view of the world in which the system operates [1].",
                "Context-aware applications exploit context information, such as location, preferences of users and so on, to adapt their behaviors in response to changing requirements of users and pervasive environments.",
                "However, one specific kind of context can often be provided by different context providers (sensors or other data sources of context information) with different quality levels.",
                "For example, in a smart home, thermometer As measurement precision is 0.1 ◦ C, and thermometer Bs measurement precision is 0.5 ◦ C. Thus A could provide more precise context information about temperature than B.",
                "Moreover, sometimes different context providers may provide conflictive context information.",
                "For example, different sensors report that the same person is in different places at the same time.",
                "Because context-aware applications utilize context information to adapt their behaviors, inappropriate context information may lead to inappropriate behavior.",
                "Thus we should design a mechanism to provide appropriate context information for current context-aware applications.",
                "In pervasive environments, context providers considered as relatively independent entities, have their own interests.",
                "They hope to get proceeds when they provide context information.",
                "However, most existing approaches consider context providers as entities without any personal interests, and use a centralized arbitrator provided by the middleware to decide who can provide appropriate context.",
                "Thus the burden of the middleware is very heavy, and its decision may be unfair and harm some providers interests.",
                "Moreover, when such arbitrator is broken down, it will cause serious consequences for context-aware applications.",
                "In this paper, we let distributed context providers themselves decide who provide context information.",
                "Since high reputation could help providers get more opportunities to provide context and get more proceeds in the future, providers try to get the right to provide good context to enhance their reputation.",
                "In order to get such right, context providers may agree to share some portion of the proceeds with its opponents.",
                "Thus context providers negotiate with each other to reach agreement on the issues who can provide context and how they allocate the proceeds.",
                "Our approach has some specific advantages: 1.",
                "We do not need an arbitrator provided by the middleware of pervasive computing to decide who provides context.",
                "Thus it will reduce the burden of the middleware. 2.",
                "It is more reasonable that distributed context providers decide who provide context, because it can avoid the serious consequences caused by a breakdown of a centralized arbitrator. 3.",
                "It can guarantee providers interests and provide fair proceeds allocation when providers negotiate with each other to reach agreement on their concerned problems. 4.",
                "This approach can choose an appropriate provider automatically.",
                "It does not need any applications and users intervention.",
                "The negotiation model we have designed to support our approach is also a novel model in negotiation domain.",
                "This model can help negotiators reach agreement in the present negotiation process by providing some guarantees over the outcome of next negotiation process (i.e. rewards).",
                "Negotiator may find current offer and reward worth more than counter-offer which will delay the agreement, and accepts current offer and reward.",
                "Without the reward, it may find current offer worth less than the counter-offer, and proposes its counter-offer.",
                "It will cost more time to reach agreement.",

                "In section 5 we introduce some related work and conclude in section 6. 2.",
                "SOME ASSUMPTIONS Before introducing our approach, we would like to give some assumptions: 1.",
                "All context providers are well-meaning and honest.",
                "During the negotiation process, they exchange information honestly.",
                "Rewards confirmed in this negotiation process will be fulfilled in the next negotiation process. 2.",
                "All providers must guarantee the systems interests.",
                "They should provide appropriate context information for current applications.",
                "After guaranteeing the systems interest, they can try to maximize their own personal interests.",
                "The assumption is reasonable, because when an inappropriate context provider gets the right to provide bad context, as a punishment, its reputation will decrease, and the proceeds is also very small. 3.",
                "As context providers are independent, factors which influence their negotiation stance and behavior are private and not available to their opponents.",
                "Their utility functions are also private. 4.",
                "Since the negotiation takes place in pervasive environments, time is a critical factors.",
                "The current application often hopes to get context information as quickly as possible, so the time cost to reach agreement should be as short as possible.",
                "Context providers often have strict deadline by when the negotiation must be completed.",
                "After presenting these assumptions, we will propose our approach based on negotiation with rewards in the next section. 3.",
                "OUR APPROACH In the beginning, we introduce the concepts of reputation and Quality of Context (QoC) attributes.",
                "Both will be used in our approach.",
                "Reputation of an agent is a perception regarding its behavior norms, which is held by other agents, based on experiences and observation of its past actions [7].",
                "Here agent means context provider.",
                "Each providers reputation indicates its historical ability to provide appropriate context information.",
                "Quality of Context (QoC) attributes characterize the quality of context information.",
                "When applications require context information, they should specify their QoC requirements which express constraints of QoC attributes.",
                "Context providers can specify QoC attributes for the context information they deliver.",
                "Although we can decide who provides appropriate context according to QoC requirements and context providers QoC information, applications QoC requirements might not reflect the actual quality requirements.",
                "Thus, in addition to QoC, reputation information of context providers is another factor affecting the decision who can provide context information.",
                "Negotiation is a process by which a joint decision is made by two or more parties.",
                "The parties first verbalize contradictory demands and then move towards agreement by a process of concession making or search for new alternatives [2].",
                "In pervasive environments, all available context providers negotiate with each other to decide who can provide context information.",
                "This process will be repeated because a kind of context is needed more than one time.",
                "Negotiation using <br>persuasive argument</br>s (such as threats, promises of future rewards, and appeals) allows negotiation parties to influence each others preferences to reach better deals effectively and efficiently [9].",
                "This pervasive negotiation is effective in repeated interaction because arguments can be constructed to directly impact future encounters.",
                "In this paper, for simplicity, we let negotiation take place between two providers.",
                "We extend Raiffas basic model for bilateral negotiation [8], and allow negotiators to negotiate with each other by exchanging arguments in the form of promises of future rewards or requests for future rewards.",
                "Rewards mean some extra proceeds in the next negotiation process.",
                "They can influence outcomes of current and future negotiation.",
                "In our approach, as described by Figure 1, the current application requires Context Manager to provide a specific type of context information satisfying QoC requirements.",
                "Context Manager finds that provider A and B can provide such kind of context with different quality levels.",
                "Then the manager tells A and B to negotiate to reach agreement on who can provide the context information and how they will allocate the proceeds.",
                "Both providers get reputation information from the database Reputation of Context Providers and QoC requirements, and then negotiate with each other according to our negotiation model.",
                "When negotiation is completed, the chosen provider will provide the context information to Context Manager, and then Context Manager delivers such information to the application and also stores it in Context Knowledge Base where current and historical context information is stored.",
                "The current application gives the feedback information about the provided context, and then Context Manager will update the chosen providers reputation information according to the feedback information.",
                "Context Manager also provides the proceeds to providers according to the feedback information and the time cost on negotiation.",
                "In the following parts of this section, we describe our negotiation model in detail, including context providers utility functions to evaluate offers and rewards, negotiation protocol, and strategies to generate offers and rewards.",

                "An offer is noted as o = (c, p): c indicates the chosen context provider and its domain is Dc (i.e. the two context providers participating in the negotiation); p means the proposers portion of the proceeds, and its domain is Dp = [0,1].",

                "The opponent evaluates the offer and reward to decide to accept them or propose a counter-offer and a reward.",
                "Thus context providers should have utility functions to evaluate offers and rewards.",
                "Time is a critical factor, and only at times in the set T = {0, 1, 2, . . . tdeadline}, context providers can propose their offers.",

                "If it is lower than its reserved utility, the provider terminates the negotiation.",

                "The negotiation is completed.",
                "However, if UB(o, ep, t) < UB(o , ep , t + 1) then B will reject As proposal, and propose its counter-offer and reward to A.",
                "When A receives Bs counter-offer and reward, A evaluates them using its utility function, and compares the utility with the utility of offer and reward it wants to propose to B at time t+2, decides to accept it or give its counter-offer and reward.",

                "The negotiation will be successfully finished when agreement is reached, or be terminated forcibly due to deadline or the utility lower than reserved utility.",
                "When negotiation is forced to be terminated, Context manager will ask A and B to calculate UA c (A), UA c (B), UB c (A) and UB c (B) respectively.",
                "If UA c (A) + UB c (A) > UA c (B) + UB c (B) Context Manager let A provide context.",

                "In addition, Context Manager allocates the proceeds between the two providers.",
                "Although we can select one provider when negotiation is terminated forcibly, however, this may lead to the unfair allocation of the proceeds.",
                "Moreover, more time negotiators cost on negotiation, less proceeds will be given.",
                "Thus negotiators will try to reach agreement as soon as possible in order to avoid unnecessary loss.",
                "When the negotiation is finished, the chosen provider provides the context information to Context Manager which will deliver the information to current application.",
                "According to the applications feedback information about this context, Context Manager updates the providers reputation stored in Reputation of Context Providers.",
                "The providers reputation may be enhanced or decreased.",
                "In addition, according to the feedback and the negotiation time, Context Manager will give proceeds to the provider.",
                "Then the provider will share the proceeds with its opponent according to the negotiation outcome and the reward confirmed in the last negotiation process.",
                "For example, in the last negotiation process A promised to give reward ep (0 ≤ ep < 1) to B, and As portion of the proceeds is p in current negotiation.",
                "Then As actual portion of the proceeds is p · (1 − ep), and its opponent Bs portion of the proceeds is 1−p+p·ep. 3.3 Negotiation strategy The context provider might want to pursue the right to provide context information blindly in order to enhance its reputation.",
                "However when it finally provides bad context information, its reputation will be decreased and the proceeds is also very small.",
                "Thus the context provider should take action according to its strategy.",
                "The aim of providers negotiation strategy is to determine the best course of action which will result in a negotiation outcome maximizing its utility function (i.e how to generate an offer and a reward).",
                "In our negotiation model, the context provider generates its offer and reward according to its pervious offer and reward and the last one sent by its opponent.",
                "At the beginning of the negotiation, context providers initialize their offers and rewards according to their beliefs and their reserved utility.",
                "If context provider A considers that it can provide good context and wants to enhance reputation, then it will propose that A provides the context information, shares some proceeds with its opponent B, and even promises to give reward.",
