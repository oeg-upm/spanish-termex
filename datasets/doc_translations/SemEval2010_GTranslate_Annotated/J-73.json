INTRODUCTION While popular images of Wall Street often depict swashbuckling traders boldly making large gambles on just their market intuitions, the vast majority of trading is actually considerably more technical and constrained. The constraints often derive from a complex combination of business, regulatory and institutional issues, and result in certain kinds of standard trading strategies or criteria that invite algorithmic analysis. One of the most common activities in modern financial markets is known as Volume Weighted Average Price, or VWAP, trading. Informally, the VWAP of a stock over a specified market period is simply the average price paid per share during that period, so the price of each transaction in the market is weighted by its volume. In VWAP trading, one attempts to buy or sell a fixed number of shares at a price that closely tracks the VWAP. Very large institutional trades constitute one of the main motivations behind VWAP activity. A typical scenario goes as follows. Suppose a very large mutual fund holds 3% of the outstanding shares of a large, publicly traded company - a huge fraction of the shares - and that this funds manager decides he would like to reduce this holding to 2% over a 1-month period. (Such a decision might be forced by the funds own regulations or other considerations.) Typically, such a fund manager would be unqualified to sell such a large number of shares in the open market - it requires a professional broker to intelligently break the trade up over time, and possibly over multiple exchanges, in order to minimize the market impact of such a sizable transaction. Thus, the fund manager would approach brokerages for help in selling the 1%. The brokerage will typically alleviate the fund managers problem immediately by simply buying the shares directly from the fund manager, and then selling them off laterbut what price should the brokerage pay the fund manager? Paying the price on the day of the sale is too risky for the brokerage, as they need to sell the shares themselves over an extended period, and events beyond their control (such as wars) could cause the price to fall dramatically. The usual answer is that the brokerage offers to buy the shares from the fund manager at a per-share price tied to the VWAP over some future period - in our example, the brokerage might offer to buy the 1% at a per-share price of the coming months VWAP minus 1 cent. The brokerage now has a very clean challenge: by selling the shares themselves over the next month in a way that exactly matches the VWAP, a penny per share is earned in profits. If they can beat the VWAP by a penny, they make two cents per share. Such small-margin, high-volume profits can be extremely lucrative for a large brokerage. The importance of the VWAP has led to many automated VWAP trading algorithms - indeed, every major brokerage has at least one VWAP box, 189 Price Volume Model Order Book Model Macroscopic Distribution Model OWT Θ(log(R)) (From[3]) O(log(R) log(N)) 2E(Pbins maxprice ) 2(1 + )E(Pbins maxprice ) for -approx of Pbins maxprice Θ(log(Q)) (same as above plus...)

The rows represent results for either the OWT or VWAP criterion. The columns represent which model we are working in. The entry in the table is the competitive ratio between our algorithm and an optimal algorithm, and the closer the ratio is to 1 the better. The parameter R represents a bound on the maximum to the minimum price fluctuation and the parameter Q represents a bound on the maximum to minimum volume fluctuation in the respective model. (See Section 4 for a description of the Macroscopic Distribution Model.) All the results for the OWT trading criterion (which is a stronger criterion) directly translate to the VWAP criterion. However, in the VWAP setting, considering a restriction on the maximum to the minimum volume fluctuation Q, leads to an additional class of results which depends on Q. and some small companies focus exclusively on proprietary VWAP trading technology. In this paper, we provide the first study of VWAP trading algorithms in an online, competitive ratio setting. We first formalize the VWAP trading problem in a basic online model we call the price-volume model, which can be viewed as a generalization of previous theoretical online trading models incorporating market volume information. In this model, we provide VWAP algorithms and competitive ratios, and compare this setting with the one-way trading (OWT) problem studied in [3]. Our most interesting results, however, examine the VWAP trading problem in a new online trading model capturing the important recent phenomenon of limit order books in financial markets. Briefly, a limit buy or sell order specifies both the number of shares and the desired price, and will only be executed if there is a matching party on the opposing side, according to a well-defined matching procedure used by all the major exchanges. While limit order books (the list of limit orders awaiting possible future execution) have existed since the dawn of equity exchanges, only very recently have these books become visible to traders in real time, thus opening the way to trading algorithms of all varieties that attempt to exploit this rich market microstructure data. Such data and algorithms are a topic of great current interest on Wall Street [4]. We thus introduce a new online trading model incorporating limit order books, and examine both the one-way and VWAP trading problems in it. Our results are summarized in Figure 1 (see the caption for a summary). 2. THEPRICE-VOLUMETRADINGMODEL We now present a trading model which includes both price and volume information about the sequence of trades. While this model is a generalization of previous formalisms for online trading, it makes an infinite liquidity assumption which fails to model the negative market impact that trading a large number of shares typically has. This will be addressed in the order book model studied in the next section. A note on terminology: throughout the paper (unless otherwise specified), we shall use the term market to describe all activity or orders other than those of the algorithm under consideration. The setting we consider can be viewed as a game between our algorithm and the market. 2.1 The Model In the price-volume trading model, we assume that the intraday trading activity in a given stock is summarized by a discrete sequence of price and volume pairs (pt, vt) for t = 1, . . . , T. Here t = 0 corresponds to the days market open, and t = T to the close. While there is nothing technically special about the time horizon of a single day, it is particularly consistent with limit order book trading on Wall Street. The pair (pt, vt) represents the fact that a total of vt shares were traded at an (average) price per share pt in the market between time t − 1 and t. Realistically, we should imagine the number of intervals T being reasonably large, so that it is sensible to assign a common approximate price to all shares traded within an interval. In the price-volume model, we shall make an infinite liquidity assumption for our trading algorithms. More precisely, in this online model, we see the price-volume sequence one pair at a time. Following the observation of (pt, vt), we are permitted to sell any (possibly fractional) number of shares nt at the price pt. Let us assume that our goal is to sell N shares over the course of the day. Hence, at each time, we must select a (possibly fractional) number of shares nt to sell at price pt, subject to the global constraint T t=1 nt = N. It is thus assumed that if we have left over shares to sell after time T − 1, we are forced to sell them at the closing price of the market - that is, nT = N − T −1 t=1 nt is sold at pT . In this way we are certain to sell exactly N shares over the course of the day; the only thing an algorithm must do is determine the schedule of selling based on the incoming market price-volume stream. Any algorithm which sells fractional volumes can be converted to a randomized algorithm which only sells integral volumes with the same expected number of shares sold. If we keep the hard constraint of selling exactly N shares, we might incur an additional slight loss in the conversion. (Note that we only allow fractional volumes in the price-volume model, where liquidity is not an issue. In the order book model to follow, we do not allow fractional volumes.) In VWAP trading, the goal of an online algorithm A which sells exactly N shares is not to maximize profits per se, but to track the market VWAP. The market VWAP for an intraday trading sequence S = (p1, v1), . . . , (pT , vT ) is simply the average price paid per share over the course of the trading 190 day, ie VWAPM (S) = T t=1 ptvt /V where V is the total daily volume, i.e., V = T t=1 vt. If on the sequence S, the algorithm A sells its N stocks using the volume sequence n1, . . . nT , then we analogously define the VWAP of A on market sequence S by VWAPA(S) = T t=1 ptnt /N . Note that the market VWAP does not include the shares that the algorithm sells. The VWAP competitive ratio of A with respect to a set of sequences Σ is then RVWAP(A) = max S∈Σ {VWAPM (S)/VWAPA(S)} In the case that A is randomized, we generalize the definition above by taking an expectation over VWAPA(S) inside the max. We note that unlike on Wall Street, our definition of VWAPM does not take our own trading into account. It is easy to see that this makes it a more challenging criterion to track. In contrast to the VWAP, another common measure of the performance of an online selling algorithm would be its one-way trading (OWT) competitive ratio [3] with respect to a set of sequences Σ: ROWT(A) = max S∈Σ max 1≤t≤T {pt/VWAPA(S)} where the algorithms performance is compared to the largest individual price appearing in the sequence S. In both VWAP and OWT, we are comparing the average price per share received by a selling algorithm to some measure of market performance. In the case of OWT, we compare to the rather ambitious benchmark of the high price of the day, ignoring volumes entirely. In VWAP trading, we have the more modest goal of comparing favorably to the overall market average of the day. As we shall see, there are some important commonalities and differences to these two approaches. For now we note one simple fact: on any specific sequence S, VWAPA(S) may be larger that VWAPM (S). However, RVWAP(A) cannot be smaller than 1, since on any sequence S in which all price pt are identical, it is impossible to get a better average share per price. Thus, for all algorithms A, both RVWAP(A) and ROWT(A) are larger than 1, and the closer to 1 they are, the better A is tracking its respective performance measure. 2.2 VWAP Results in the Price-Volume Model As in previous work on online trading, it is generally not possible to obtain finite bounds on competitive ratios with absolutely no assumptions on the set of sequences Σbounds on the maximum variation in price or volume are required, depending on the exact setting. We thus introduce the following two assumptions. 2.2.0.1 Volume Variability Assumption.. Let 0 < Vmin ≤ Vmax be known positive constants, and define Q = Vmax /Vmin . For all intraday trading sequences S ∈ Σ, the total daily volume V ∈ [Vmin , Vmax ]. 2.2.0.2 Price Variability Assumption.. Let 0 < pmin ≤ pmax be known positive constants, and define R = pmax/pmin. For all intraday trading sequences S ∈ Σ, the prices satisfy pt ∈ [pmin, pmax], for all t = 1, . . . , T. Competitive ratios are generally taken over all sets Σ consistent with at least one of these assumptions. To gain some intuition consider the two trivial cases of R = 1 and Q = 1. In the case of R = 1 (where there is no fluctuation in price), any schedule is optimal. In the case of Q = 1 (where the total volume V over the trading period is known), we can gain a competitive ratio of 1 by selling vt V N shares after each time period. For the OWT problem in the price-volume model, volumes are irrelevant for the performance criterion, but for the VWAP criterion they are central. For the OWT problem under the price variability assumption, the results of [3] established that the optimal competitive ratio was Θ(log(R)). Our first result establishes that the optimal competitive ratio for VWAP under the volume variability assumption is Θ(log(Q)) and is achieved by an algorithm that ignores the price data. Theorem 1. In the price-volume model under the volume variability assumption, there exists an online algorithm A for selling N shares achieving competitive ratio RVWAP(A) ≤ 2 log(Q). In addition, if only the volume variability (and not the price variability) assumption holds, any online algorithm A for selling N shares has RVWAP(A) = Ω(log(Q)). Proof. (Sketch) For the upper bound, the idea is similar to the price reservation algorithm of [3] for the OWT problem, and similar in spirit to the general technique of classify and select [1]. Consider algorithms which use a parameter ˆV , which is interpreted as an estimate for the total volume for the day. Then at each time t, if the market price and volume is (pt, vt), the algorithm sells a fraction vt/ ˆV of its shares. We consider a family of log(Q) such algorithms, where algorithm Ai uses ˆV = Vmin 2i−1 . Clearly, one of the Ai has a competitive ratio of 2. We can derive an O(log(Q)) VWAP competitive ratio by running these algorithms in parallel, and letting each algorithm sell N/ log(Q) shares. (Alternatively, we can randomly select one Ai and guarantee the same expected competitive ratio.) We now sketch the proof of the lower bound, which relates performance in the VWAP and OWT problems. Any algorithm that is c-competitive in the VWAP setting (under fixed Q) is 3c-competitive in the OWT setting with R = Q/2. To show this, we take any sequence S of prices for the OWT problem, and convert it into a price-volume sequence for the VWAP problem. The prices in the VWAP sequence are the same as in S. To construct the volumes in the VWAP sequence, we segment the prices in S into log(R) intervals [2i−1 pmin , 2i pmin ). Suppose pt ∈ [2i−1 pmin , 2i pmin ), and this is the first time in S that a price has fallen in this interval. Then in the VWAP sequence we set the volume vt = 2i−1 . If this is not the first visit to the interval containing pt, we set vt = 0. Assume that the maximum price in S is pmax . The VWAP of our sequence is at least pmax /3. Since we had a c competitive algorithm, its average sell is at least pmax /3c. The lower bound now follows using the lower bound in [3]. An alternative approach to VWAP is to ignore the volumes in favor of prices, and apply an algorithm for the OWT problem. Note that the lower bound in this theorem, unlike in the previous one, only assumes a price variation bound. 191 Theorem 2. In the price-volume model under the price variability assumption, there exists an online algorithm A for selling N shares achieving competitive ratio RVWAP(A) = O(log(R)). In addition, if only the price variability (and not the volume variability) assumption holds, any online A for selling N shares has RVWAP(A) = Ω(log(R)). Proof. (Sketch) Follows immediately from the results of [3] for OWT: the upper bound from the simple fact that for any sequence S, VWAPA(S) is less than max1≤t≤T {pt}, and the lower bound from a reduction to OWT. Theorems 1 and 2 demonstrate that one can achieve logarithmic VWAP competitive ratios under the assumption of either bounded variability of total volume or bounded variability of maximum price. If both assumptions hold, it is possible to give an algorithm accomplishing the minimum of log(Q) and log(R). This flexibility of approach derives from the fact that the VWAP is a quantity in which both prices and volumes matter, as opposed to OWT. 2.3 RelatedResultsinthePrice-VolumeModel All of the VWAP algorithms we have discussed so far make some use of the daily data (pt, vt) as it unfolds, using either the price or volume information. In contrast, a fixed schedule VWAP algorithm has a predetermined distribution {f1, f2, . . . fT }, and simply sells ftN shares at time t, independent of (pt, vt). Fixed schedule VWAP algorithms, or slight variants of them, are surprisingly common on Wall Street, and the schedule is usually derived from historical intraday volume data. Our next result demonstrates that such algorithms can perform considerably worse than dynamically adaptive algorithms in terms of the worst case competitive ratio. Theorem 3. In the price-volume model under both the volume and price variability assumptions, any fixed schedule VWAP algorithm A for selling N shares has sell VWAP competitive ratio RVWAP(A) = Ω(min(T, R)). The proofs of all the results in this subsection are in the Appendix. So far our emphasis has been on VWAP algorithms that must sell exactly N shares. In many realistic circumstances, however, there is actually some flexibility in the precise number of shares to be sold. For instance, this is true at large brokerages, where many separate VWAP trades may be pooled and executed by a common algorithm, and the firm would be quite willing to carry a small position of unsold shares overnight if it resulted in better execution prices. The following theorem (which interestingly has no analogue for the OWT problem) demonstrates that this trade-off in shares sold and performance can be realized dramatically in our model. It states that if we are willing to let the number of shares sold vary with Q, we can in fact achieve a VWAP competitive ratio of 1. Theorem 4. In the price-volume model under the volume variability assumption, there exists an algorithm A that always sells between N and QN shares and that the average price per sold share is exactly VWAPM (S). In many online problems, there is a clear distinction between benefit problems and cost problems [2]. In the VWAP setting, selling shares is a benefit problem, and buying shares is a cost problem. The definitions of the competitive ratios, Rbuy VWAP(A) and Rbuy OWT(A), for algorithms which Figure 2: Sample Island order books for MSFT. buy exactly N shares are maxS∈Σ{VWAPA(S)/VWAPM (S)} and maxS∈Σ maxt{VWAPA(S)/pt} respectively. Eventhough Theorem 4 also holds for buying, in general, the competitive ratio of the buy (cost) problem is much higher, as stated in the following theorem. Theorem 5. In the price-volume model under the volume and price variability assumptions, there exists an online algorithm A for buying N shares achieving buy VWAP competitive ratio Rbuy VWAP(A) = O(min{Q, √ R}). In addition any online algorithm A for buying N shares has buy VWAP competitive ratio Rbuy VWAP(A) = Ω(min{Q, √ R}). 3. A LIMIT ORDER BOOK TRADING MODEL Before we can define our online trading model based on limit order books, we give some necessary background on the detailed mechanics of financial markets, which are sometimes referred to as market microstructure. We then provide results and algorithms for both the OWT and VWAP problems. 192 3.1 Background on Limit Order Books and Market Microstructure A fundamental distinction in stock trading is that between a limit order and a market order. Suppose we wish to purchase 1000 shares of Microsoft (MSFT) stock. In a limit order, we specify not only the desired volume (1000 shares), but also the desired price. Suppose that MSFT is currently trading at roughly $24.07 a share (see Figure 2, which shows an actual snapshot of a recent MSFT order book on Island (www.island.com), a well-known electronic exchange for NASDAQ stocks), but we are only willing to buy the 1000 shares at $24.04 a share or lower. We can choose to submit a limit order with this specification, and our order will be placed in a queue called the buy order book, which is ordered by price, with the highest offered unexecuted buy price at the top (often referred to as the bid). If there are multiple limit orders at the same price, they are ordered by time of arrival (with older orders higher in the book). In the example provided by Figure 2, our order would be placed immediately after the extant order for 5,503 shares at $24.04; though we offer the same price, this order has arrived before ours. Similarly, a sell order book for sell limit orders (for instance, we might want to sell 500 shares of MSFT at $24.10 or higher) is maintained, this time with the lowest sell price offered (often referred to as the ask). Thus, the order books are sorted from the most competitive limit orders at the top (high buy prices and low sell prices) down to less competitive limit orders. The bid and ask prices (which again, are simply the prices in the limit orders at the top of the buy and sell books, respectively) together are sometimes referred to as the inside market, and the difference between them as the spread. By definition, the order books always consist exclusively of unexecuted orders - they are queues of orders hopefully waiting for the price to move in their direction. How then do orders get executed? There are two methods. First, any time a market order arrives, it is immediately matched with the most competitive limit orders on the opposing book. Thus, a market order to buy 2000 shares is matched with enough volume on the sell order book to fill the 2000 shares. For instance, in the example of Figure 2, such an order would be filled by the two limit sell orders for 500 shares at $24.069, the 500 shares at $24.07, the 200 shares at $24.08, and then 300 of the 1981 shares at $24.09. The remaining 1681 shares of this last limit order would remain as the new top of the sell limit order book. Second, if a buy (sell, respectively) limit order comes in above the ask (below the bid, respectively) price, then the order is matched with orders on the opposing books. It is important to note that the prices of executions are the prices specified in the limit orders already in the books, not the prices of the incoming order that is immediately executed. Every market or limit order arrives atomically and instantaneously - there is a strict temporal sequence in which orders arrive, and two orders can never arrive simultaneously. This gives rise to the definition of the last price of the exchange, which is simply the last price at which the exchange executed an order. It is this quantity that is usually meant when people casually refer to the (ticker) price of a stock. Note that a limit buy (sell, respectively) order with a price of infinity (0, respectively) is effectively a market order. We shall thus assume without loss of generality that all orders are placed as limit order. Although limit orders which are unexecuted may be removed by the party which placed them, for simplicity, we assume that limit orders are never removed from the books. We refer the reader to [4] for further discussion of modern electronic exchanges and market microstructure. 3.2 The Model The online order book trading model is intended to capture the realistic details of market microstructure just discussed in a competitive ratio setting. In this refined model, a days market activity is described by a sequence of limit orders (pt, vt, bt). Here bt is a bit indicating whether the order is a buy or sell order, while pt is the limit order price and vt the number of shares desired. Following the arrival of each such limit order, an online trading algorithm is permitted to place its own limit order. These two interleaved sources (market and algorithm) of limit orders are then simply operated on according to the matching process described in Section 3.1. Any limit order that is not immediately executable according to this process is placed in the appropriate (buy or sell) book for possible future execution; arriving orders that can be partially or fully executed are so executed, with any residual shares remaining on the respective book. The goal of a VWAP or OWT selling algorithm is essentially the same as in the price-volume model, but the context has changed in the following two fundamental ways. First, the assumption of infinite liquidity in the price-volume model is eliminated entirely. The number of shares available at any given price is restricted to the total volume of limit orders offering that price. Second, all incoming orders, and therefore the complete limit order books, are assumed to be visible to the algorithm. This is consistent with modern electronic financial exchanges, and indeed is the source of much current interest on Wall Street [4]. In general, the definition of competitive ratios in the order book model is complicated by the fact that now our algorithms activity influences the sequence of executed prices and volumes. We thus first define the execution sequence determined by a limit order sequence (placed by the market and our algorithm). Let S = (p1, v1, b1), . . . , (pT , vT , bT ) be a limit order sequence placed by the market, and let S = (p1, v1, b1), . . . , (pT , vT , bT ) be a limit order sequence placed by our algorithm (unless otherwise specified, all bt are of the sell type). Let merge(S, S ) be the merged sequence (p1, v1, b1), (p1, v1, b1), . . . , (pT , vT , bT ), (pT , vT , bT ), which is the time sequence of orders placed by the market and algorithm. Note that the algorithm has the option of not placing an order, which we can view as a zero volume order. If we conducted the order book maintenance and order execution process described in Section 3.1 on the sequence merge(S, S ), at irregular intervals a trade occurs for some number of shares and some price. In each executed trade, the selling party is either the market or the algorithm. Let execM (S, S ) = (q1, w1), . . . , (qT , wT ) be the sequence of executions where the market (that is, a party other than the algorithm) was the selling party, where the qt are the execution prices and wt the execution volumes. Similarly, we define execA(S, S ) = (r1, x1), . . . , (rT , xT ) to be the sequence of executions in which the algorithm was the selling party. Thus, execA(S, S ) ∪ execM (S, S ) is the set of all executions. We generally expect T to be (possibly much) smaller than T . The revenue of the algorithm and the market are defined 193 as: REVM (S, S ) ≡ T t=1 qtwt , REVA(S, S ) ≡ T t=1 rtxt Note that both these quantities are solely determined by the execution sequences execM (S, S ) and execA(S, S ), respectively. For an algorithm A which is constrained to sell exactly N shares, we define the OWT competitive ratio of A, ROWT(A), as the maximum ratio (under any S ∈ Σ) of the revenue obtained by A, as compared to the revenue obtained by an optimal oﬄine algorithm A∗ . More formally, for A∗ which is constrained to sell exactly N shares, we define ROWT(A) = max S∈Σ max A∗ REVA∗ (S S∗ ) REVA(S, S ) where S∗ is the limit order sequence placed by A∗ on S. If the algorithm A is randomized then we take the appropriate expectation with respect to S ∼ A. We define the VWAP competitive ratio, RVWAP(A), as the maximum ratio (under any S ∈ Σ) between the market and algorithm VWAPs. More formally, define VWAPM (S, S ) as REVM (S, S )/ T t=1 wt, where the denominator is just the total executed volume of orders placed by the market. Similarly, we define VWAPA(S, S ) as REVA(S, S )/N, since we assume the algorithm sells no more than N shares (this definition implicitly assumes that A gets a 0 price for unsold shares). The VWAP competitive ratio of A is then: RVWAP(A) = max S∈Σ {VWAPM (S, S )/VWAPA(S, S )} where S is the online sequence of limit orders generated by A in response to the sequence S. 3.3 OWT Results in the Order Book Model For the OWT problem in the order book model, we introduce a more subtle version of the price variability assumption. This is due to the fact that our algorithms trading can impact the high and low prices of the day. For the assumption below, note that execM (S, ∅) is the sequence of executions without the interaction of our algorithm. 3.3.0.3 Order Book Price Variability Assumption.. Let 0 < pmin ≤ pmax be known positive constants, and define R = pmax/pmin. For all intraday trading sequences S ∈ Σ, the prices pt in the sequence execM (S, ∅) satisfy pt ∈ [pmin, pmax], for all t = 1, . . . , T. Note that this assumption does not imply that the ratios of high to low prices under the sequences execM (S, S ) or execA(S, S ) are bounded by R. In fact, the ratio in the sequence execA(S, S ) could be infinite if the algorithm ends up selling some stocks at a 0 price. Theorem 6. In the order book model under the order book price variability assumption, there exists an online algorithm A for selling N shares achieving sell OWT competitive ratio ROWT(A) = 2 log(R) log(N). Proof. The algorithm A works by guessing a price p in the set {pmin2i : 1 ≤ i ≤ log(R)} and placing a sell limit order for all N shares at the price p at the beginning of the day. (Alternatively, algorithm A can place log(R) sell limit orders, where the i-th one has price 2i pmin and volume N/ log(R).) By placing an order at the beginning of the day, the algorithm undercuts all sell orders that will be placed during the day for a price of p or higher, meaning the algorithms N shares must be filled first at this price. Hence, if there were k shares that would have been sold at price p or higher without our activity, then A would sell at least kp shares. We define {pj} to be the multiset of prices of individual shares that are either executed or are buy limit order shares that remained unexecuted, excluding the activity of our algorithm (that is, assuming our algorithm places no orders). Assume without loss of generality that p1 ≥ p2 ≥ . . .. Consider guessing the kth highest such price, pk. If an order for N shares is placed at the days start at price pk, then we are guaranteed to obtain a return of kpk. Let k∗ = argmaxk{kpk}. We can view our algorithm as attempting to guess pk∗ , and succeeding if the guess p satisfies p ∈ [pk∗ /2, pk∗ ]. Hence, we are 2 log(R) competitive with the quantity max1≤k≤N kpk. Note that ρ ≡ N i=1 pi = N i=1 1 i ipi ≤ max 1≤k≤N kpk N i=1 1 i ≤ log(N) max 1≤k≤N kpk where ρ is defined as the sum of the top N prices pi without As involvement. Similarly, let {pj} be the multiset of prices of individual executed shares, or the prices of unexecuted buy order shares, but now including the orders placed by some selling algorithm A . We now wish to show that for all algorithms A which sell N shares, REVA ≤ N i=1 pi ≤ ρ. Essentially, this inequality states the intuitive idea that a selling algorithm can only lower executed or unmatched buy order share prices. To prove this, we use induction to show that the removal of the activity of a selling algorithm causes these prices to increase. First, remove the last share in the last sell order placed by either A or the market on an arbitrary sequence merge(S, S ) - by this we mean, take the last sell order placed by A or the market and decrease its volume by one share. After this modification, the top N prices p1 . . . pN will not decrease. This is because either this sell order share was not executed, in which case the claim is trivially true, or, if it was executed, the removal of this sell order share leaves an additional unexecuted buy order share of equal or higher price. For induction, assume that if we remove a share from any sell order that was placed, by A or the market, at or after time t then the top N prices do not decrease. We now show that if we remove a share from the last sell order that was placed by A or the market before time t, then the top N prices do not decrease. If this sell order share was not executed, then the claim is trivially true. Else, if the sell order share was executed, then claim is true because by removing this executed share from the sell order either: i) the corresponding buy order share (of equal or higher value) is unmatched on the remainder of the sequence, in which case the claim is true; or ii) this buy 194 order matches some sell order share at an equal or higher price, which has the effect of removing a share from a sell order on the remainder of the sequence, and, by the inductive assumption, this can only increase prices. Hence, we have proven that for all A which sell N shares REVA ≤ ρ. We have now established that our revenue satisfies 2 log(R)ES ∼A[REVA(S, S )] ≥ max 1≤k≤N {kpk} ≥ ρ/ log(N) ≥ max A {REVA }/ log(N), where A performs an arbitrary sequence of N sell limit orders. 3.4 VWAP Results in the Order Book Model The OWT algorithm from Theorem 6 can be applied to obtain the following VWAP result: Corollary 7. In the order book model under the order book price variability assumption, there exists an online algorithm A for selling N shares achieving sell VWAP competitive ratio RVWAP(A) = O(log(R) log(N)). We now make a rather different assumption on the sequences S. 3.4.0.4 Bounded Order Volume and Max Price Assumption. The set of sequences Σ satisfies the following two properties. First, we assume that each order placed by the market is of volume less than γ, which we view as a mild assumption since typically single orders on the market are not of high volume (due to liquidity issues). This assumption allows our algorithm to place at least one limit order at a time interleaved with approximately γ market executions. Second, we assume that there is large volume in the sell order books below the price pmax , which means that no orders placed by the market will be executed above the price pmax . The simplest way to instantiate this latter assumption in the order book model is to assume that each sequence S ∈ Σ starts by placing a huge number of sell orders (more than Vmax ) at price pmax . Although this assumption has a maximum price parameter, it does not imply that the price ratio R is finite, since it does not imply any lower bound on the prices of buy or executed shares (aside from the trivial one of 0). Theorem 8. Consider the order book model under the bounded order volume and max price assumption. There exists an algorithm A in which after exactly γN market executions have occurred, then A has sold at most N shares and REVA(S, S ) N = VWAPA(S, S ) ≥ (1 − )VWAPM (S, S ) − pmax N where S is a sequence of N sell limit orders generated by A when observing S. Proof. The algorithm divides the trading day into volume intervals whose real-time duration may vary. For each period i in which γ shares have been executed in the market, the algorithm computes the market VWAP of only those shares traded in period i; let us denote this by VWAPi. Following this ith volume interval, the algorithm places a limit order to sell exactly one share at a price close to VWAPi. More precisely, the algorithm only places orders at the discrete prices (1− )pmax , (1− )2 pmax , . . .. Following volume interval i, the algorithm places a limit order to sell one share at the discretized price that is closest to VWAPi, but which is strictly smaller. For the analysis, we begin by noting that if all of the algorithms limit orders are executed during the day, the total revenue received by the algorithm would be at least (1 − )VWAPM (S, S )N. To see this, it suffices to note that VWAPM (S, S ) is a uniform mixture of the VWAPi (since by definition they each cover the same amount of market volume); and if all the algorithms limit orders were executed, they each received more than (1 − )VWAPi dollars for the interval i they followed. We now count the potential lost revenue of the algorithm due to unexecuted limit orders. By the assumption that individual orders are placed with volume less than γ, then our algorithm is able to place a limit order during every block of γ shares have been traded. Hence, after γN market orders have been executed, A has placed N orders in the market. Note that there can be at most one limit order (and thus, at most one share) left unexecuted at each level of the discretized price ladder defined above. This is because following interval i, the algorithm places its limit order strictly below VWAPi, so if VWAPj ≥ VWAPi for j > i, this limit order must have been executed. Thus unexecuted limit orders bound the VWAPs of the remainder of the day, resulting in at most one unexecuted order per price level. A bound on the lost revenue is thus the sum of the discretized prices: ∞ i=1(1 − )i pmax ≤ pmax / . Clearly our algorithm has sold at most N shares. Note that as N becomes large, VWAPA approaches 1 − times the market VWAP. If we knew that the final total volume of the market executions is V , then we can set γ = V/N, assuming that γ >> 1. If we have only an upper and lower bound on V we should be able to guess and incur a logarithmic loss. The following assumption tries to capture the market volume variability. 3.4.0.5 Order Book Volume Variability Assumption. We now assume that the total volume (which includes the shares executed by both our algorithm and the market) is variable within some known region and that the market volume will be greater than our algorithms volume. More formally, for all S ∈ Σ, assume that the total volume V of shares traded in execM (S, S ), for any sequence S of N sell limit orders, satisfies 2N ≤ Vmin ≤ V ≤ Vmax . Let Q = Vmax /Vmin . The following corollary is derived using a constant = 1/2 and observing that if we set γ such that V ≤ γN ≤ 2V then our algorithm will place between N and N/2 limit orders. Corollary 9. In the order book model, if the bounded order volume and max price assumption, and the order book volume variability assumption hold, there exists an online algorithm A for selling at most N shares such that VWAPA(S, S ) ≥ 1 4 log(Q) VWAPM (S, S ) − 2pmax N 195 0 2 4 6 8 x 10 7 0 20 40 60 80 100 QQQ: log(Q)=4.71, E=3.77 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 6 0 20 40 60 80 JNPR: log(Q)=5.66, E=3.97 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 6 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 MCHP: log(Q)=5.28, E=3.86 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 6 0 50 100 150 200 250 CHKP: log(Q)=6.56, E=4.50 Figure 3: Here we present bounds from Section 4 based on the empirical volume distributions for four real stocks: QQQ, MCHP, JNPR, and CHKP. The plots show histograms for the total daily volumes transacted on Island for these stocks, in the last year and a half, along with the corresponding values of log(Q) and E(Pbins vol ) (denoted by E). We assume that the minimum and maximum daily volumes in the data correspond to Vmin and Vmax , respectively. The worst-case competitive ratio bounds (which are twice log(Q)) of our algorithm for those stocks are 9.42, 10.56, 11.32, and 13.20, respectively. The corresponding bounds on the competitive ratio performance of our algorithm under the volume distribution model (which are twice E(Pbins vol )) are better: 7.54, 7.72, 7.94, and 9.00, respectively (a 20−40% relative improvement). Using a finer volume binning along with a slightly more refined bound on the competitive ratio, we can construct algorithms that, using the empirical volume distribution given as correct, guarantee even better competitive ratios of 2.76, 2.73, 2.75, and 3.17, respectively for those stocks (details omitted). 4. MACROSCOPIC DISTRIBUTION MODELS We conclude our results with a return to the price-volume model, where we shall introduce some refined methods of analysis for online trading algorithms. We leave the generalization of these methods to the order book model for future work. The competitive ratios defined so far measure performance relative to some baseline criterion in the worst case over all market sequences S ∈ Σ. It has been observed in many online settings that such worst-case metrics can yield pessimistic results, and various relaxations have been considered, such as permitting a probability distribution over the input sequence. We now consider distributional models that are considerably weaker than assuming a distribution over complete market sequences S ∈ Σ. In the volume distribution model, we assume only that there exists a distribution Pvol over the total volume V traded in the market for the day, and then examine the worst-case competitive ratio over sequences consistent with the randomly chosen volume. More precisely, we define RVWAP(A, Pvol ) = EV ∼Pvol max S∈seq(V ) VWAPM (S) VWAPA(S) . Here V ∼ Pvol denotes that V is chosen with respect to distribution Pvol , and seq(V ) ⊂ Σ is the set of all market sequences (p1, v1), . . . , (pT , vT ) satisfying T t=1 vt = V . Similarly, for OWT, we can define ROWT(A, Pmaxprice ) = Ep∼Pmaxprice max S∈seq(p) p VWAPA(S) . Here Pmaxprice is a distribution over just the maximum price of the day, and we then examine worst-case sequences consistent with this price (seq(p) ⊂ Σ is the set of all market sequences satisfying max1≤t≤T pt = p). Analogous buy-side definitions can be given. We emphasize that in these models, only the distribution of maximum volume and price is known to the algorithm. We also note that our probabilistic assumptions on S are considerably weaker than typical statistical finance models, which would posit a detailed stochastic model for the step-by-step evolution of (pt, vt). Here we instead permit only a distribution over crude, macroscopic measures of the entire days market activity, such as the total volume and high price, and analyze the worst-case performance consistent with these crude measures. For this reason, we refer to such settings as the macroscopic distribution model. The work of El-Yaniv et al. [3] examines distributional assumptions similar to ours, but they emphasize the worst196 case choices for the distributions as well, and show that this leads to results no better than the original worst-case analysis over all sequences. In contrast, we feel that the analysis of specific distributions Pvol and Pmaxprice is natural in many financial contexts and our preliminary experimental results show significant improvements when this rather crude distributional information is taken into account (see Figure 3). Our results in the VWAP setting examine the cases where these distributions are known exactly or only approximately. Similar results can be obtained for macroscopic distributions of maximum daily price for the one-way trading setting. 4.1 Results in the Macroscopic Distribution Model We begin by noting that the algorithms examined so far work by binning total volumes or maximum prices into bins of exponentially increasing size, and then guessing the index of the bin in which the actual quantity falls. It is thus natural that the macroscopic distribution model performance of such algorithms (which are common in competitive analysis) might depend on the distribution of the true bin index. In the remaining, we assume that Q is a power of 2 and the base of the logarithm is 2. Let Pvol denote the distribution of total daily market volume. We define the related distribution Pbins vol over bin indices i as follows: for all i = 1, . . . , log(Q) − 1, Pbins vol (i) is equal to the probability, under Pvol , that the daily volume falls in the interval [Vmin 2i−1 , Vmin 2i ), and Pbins vol (log(Q)) is for the last interval [Vmax /2, Vmax ] . We define E as E(Pbins vol ) ≡ Ei∼P bins vol 1/Pbins vol (i) 2 =   log(Q) i=1 Pbins vol (i)   2 . Since the support of Pbins vol has only log(Q) elements, E(Pbins vol ) can vary from 1 (for distributions Pvol that place all of their weight in only one of the log(Q) intervals between Vmin , Vmin 2, Vmin 4, . . . , Vmax ) to log(Q) (for distributions Pvol in which the total daily volume is equally likely to fall in any one of these intervals). Note that distributions Pvol of this latter type are far from uniform over the entire range [Vmin , Vmax ]. Theorem 10. In the volume distribution model under the volume variability assumption, there exists an online algorithm A for selling N shares that, using only knowledge of the total volume distribution Pvol , achieves RVWAP(A, Pvol ) ≤ 2E(Pbins vol ). All proofs in this section are provided in the appendix. As a concrete example, consider the case in which Pvol is the uniform distribution over [Vmin , Vmax ]. In that case, Pbins vol is exponentially increasing and peaks at the last bin, which, having the largest width, also has the largest weight. In this case E(Pbins vol ) is a constant (i.e., independent of Q), leading to a constant competitive ratio. On the other hand, if Pvol is exponential, then Pbins vol is uniform, leading to an O(log(Q)) competitive ratio, just as in the more adversarial price-volume setting discussed earlier. In Figure 3, we provide additional specific bounds obtained for empirical total daily volume distributions computed for some real stocks. We now examine the setting in which Pvol is unknown, but an approximation ˜Pvol is available. Let us define C(Pbins vol , ˜Pbins vol ) = log(Q) j=1 ˜Pbins vol (j) log(Q) i=1 P bins vol (i) √ ˜P bins vol (i) . C is minimized at C(Pbins vol , Pbins vol ) = E(Pbins vol ), and C may be infinite if ˜Pbins vol (i) is 0 when Pbins vol (i) > 0. Theorem 11. In the volume distribution model under the volume variability assumption, there exists an online algorithm A for selling N shares that using only knowledge of an approximation ˜Pvol of Pvol achieves RVWAP(A, Pvol ) ≤ 2C(Pbins vol , ˜Pbins vol ). As an example of this result, suppose our approximation obeys (1/α)Pbins vol (i) ≤ ˜Pbins vol (i) ≤ αPbins vol (i) for all i, for some α > 1. Thus our estimated bin index probabilities are all within a factor of α of the truth. Then it is easy to show that C(Pbins vol , ˜Pbins vol ) ≤ αE(Pbins vol ), so according to Theorems 10 and 11 our penalty for using the approximate distribution is a factor of α in competitive ratio. 5.

(Sketch of Theorem 3) W.l.o.g., assume that Q = 1 and the total volume is V . Consider the time t where the fixed schedule f sells the least, then ft ≤ N/T. Consider the sequences where at time t we have pt = pmax , vt = V , and for times t = t we have pt = pmin and vt = 0. The VWAP is pmax and the fixed schedule average is (N/T)pmax + (N − N/T)pmin . Proof. (Sketch of Theorem 4) The algorithm simply sells ut = (vt/Vmin )N shares at time t. The total number of shares sold U is clearly more than N and U = t ut = t (vt/Vmin )N = (V/Vmin )N ≤ QN The average price is V WAPA(S) = ( t ptut)/U = t pt(vt/V ) = V WAPM (S), where we used the fact that ut/U = vt/V . 197 Proof. (of Theorem 5) We start with the proof of the lower bound. Consider the following scenario. For the first T time units we have a price of √ Rpmin , and a total volume of Vmin . We observe how many shares the online algorithm has bought. If it has bought more than half of the shares, the remaining time steps have price pmin and volume Vmax − Vmin . Otherwise, the remaining time steps have price pmax and negligible volume. In the first case the online has paid at least √ Rpmin /2 while the VWAP is at most √ Rpmin /Q + pmin . Therefore, in this case the competitive ratio is Ω(Q). In the second case the online has to buy at least half of the shares at pmax , so its average cost is at least pmax /2. The market VWAP is√ Rpmin = pmax / √ R, hence the competitive ratio is Ω( √ R). For the upper bound, we can get a √ R competitive ratio, by buying all the shares once the price drops below √ Rpmin . The Q upper bound is derive by running an algorithm that assumes the volume is Vmin . The online pays a cost of p, while the VWAP will be at least p/Q. 6.2 Proofs from Section 4 Proof. (Sketch of Theorem 10) We use the idea of guessing the total volume from Theorem 1, but now allow for the possibility of an arbitrary (but known) distribution over the total volume. In particular, consider constructing a distribution Gbins vol over a set of volume values using Pvol and use it to guess the total volume V . Let the algorithm guess ˆV = Vmin 2i with probability Gbins vol (i). Then note that, for any price-volume sequence S, if V ∈ [Vmin 2i−1 , Vmin 2i ], VWAPA(S) ≥ Gbins vol (i)VWAPM (S)/2. This implies an upper bound on RVWAP(A, Pvol ) in terms of Gbins vol . We then get that Gbins vol (i) ∝ Pbins vol (i) minimizes the upper bound, which leads to the upper bound stated in the theorem. Proof. (Sketch of Theorem 11) Replace Pvol with ˜Pvol in the expression for Gbins vol in the proof sketch for the last result. 198",

Introducción Si bien las imágenes populares de Wall Street a menudo representan a los comerciantes de swashbuckling con audacia grandes apuestas en sus intuiciones en el mercado, la gran mayoría de los comercios es realmente más técnico y limitado. Las restricciones a menudo se derivan de una combinación compleja de problemas comerciales, regulatorios e institucionales, y dan como resultado ciertos tipos de estrategias o criterios comerciales estándar que invitan a análisis algorítmico. Una de las actividades más comunes en los mercados financieros modernos se conoce como precio promedio ponderado por volumen, o VWAP, negociación. Informalmente, el VWAP de una acción durante un período de mercado especificado es simplemente el precio promedio pagado por acción durante ese período, por lo que el precio de cada transacción en el mercado está ponderado por su volumen. En el comercio de VWAP, uno intenta comprar o vender un número fijo de acciones a un precio que rastrea de cerca el VWAP. Los oficios institucionales muy grandes constituyen una de las principales motivaciones detrás de la actividad de VWAP. Un escenario típico es el siguiente. Supongamos que un fondo mutuo muy grande posee el 3% de las acciones en circulación de una gran empresa que cotiza en bolsa, una gran fracción de las acciones, y que este gerente de fondos decide que le gustaría reducir esta tenencia al 2% durante un período de 1 mes..(Tal decisión podría ser forzada por las propias regulaciones de los fondos u otras consideraciones). Por lo general, dicho administrador de fondos no estaría calificado para vender una cantidad tan grande de acciones en el mercado abierto: requiere que un corredor profesional rompa inteligentemente el intercambio con el tiempo, y posiblemente en múltiples intercambios, para minimizar el impacto del mercado deuna transacción tan considerable. Por lo tanto, el Administrador de fondos abordaría las casas de bolsa para obtener ayuda para vender el 1%. La corredora generalmente aliviará el problema de los administradores de fondos inmediatamente simplemente comprando las acciones directamente del Administrador del Fondo, y luego venderlas más tarde, pero ¿qué precio debería pagar la corredora al Administrador del Fondo? Pagar el precio el día de la venta es demasiado arriesgado para la corretaje, ya que necesitan vender las acciones en sí mismas durante un período prolongado, y los eventos más allá de su control (como las guerras) podrían hacer que el precio caiga drásticamente. La respuesta habitual es que la corredora ofrece comprar las acciones del Administrador de fondos a un precio por acción vinculado al VWAP durante algún período futuro; en nuestro ejemplo, la corredora podría ofrecer comprar el 1% a un precio por acción.de los próximos meses VWAP menos 1 centavo. La corredora ahora tiene un desafío muy limpio: al vender las acciones en sí misma durante el próximo mes de una manera que coincide exactamente con el VWAP, se obtiene un centavo por acción en las ganancias. Si pueden vencer al VWAP por un centavo, hacen dos centavos por acción. Tales ganancias pequeñas y de alto volumen pueden ser extremadamente lucrativas para una gran corredora. La importancia del VWAP ha llevado a muchos algoritmos automatizados de comercio de VWAP; de hecho, cada corretaje importante tiene al menos un cuadro VWAP, 189 precio Modelo de volumen Modelo de pedido Modelo de distribución macroscópica Modelo OWT θ (log (R)) (de [3])O (log (r) log (n)) 2e (pbins maxprice) 2 (1 +) e (pbins maxprice) para -approx de pbins maxprice θ (log (q)) (igual que arriba más ...) vwap θ(log (r)) o (log (r) log (n)) (desde arriba) 2e (pbins vol) ω (q) Programa fijo o (log (Q)) para N (1 +) 2e (Pbins Vol) para -approx.de Pbins Vol 1 para volumen en [N, Qn] Figura 1: La tabla resume los resultados presentados en este documento. Las filas representan resultados para el criterio OWT o VWAP. Las columnas representan en qué modelo estamos trabajando. La entrada en la tabla es la relación competitiva entre nuestro algoritmo y un algoritmo óptimo, y cuanto más cerca sea la relación a 1 mejor. El parámetro R representa un límite en el máximo a la fluctuación mínima del precio y el parámetro Q representa un límite en la fluctuación de volumen máximo a mínimo en el modelo respectivo.(Consulte la Sección 4 para obtener una descripción del modelo de distribución macroscópica). Todos los resultados para el criterio de comercio OWT (que es un criterio más fuerte) se traducen directamente al criterio VWAP. Sin embargo, en el entorno VWAP, considerando una restricción en el máximo de la fluctuación mínima de volumen Q, conduce a una clase adicional de resultados que depende de Q. y algunas pequeñas empresas se centran exclusivamente en la tecnología de comercio VWAP patentado. En este documento, proporcionamos el primer estudio de los algoritmos de comercio VWAP en una configuración de relación competitiva en línea. Primero formalizamos el problema de negociación VWAP en un modelo básico en línea que llamamos el modelo de precio-volumen, que puede verse como una generalización de los modelos de comercio en línea teóricos anteriores que incorporan información del volumen del mercado. En este modelo, proporcionamos algoritmos VWAP y proporciones competitivas, y comparamos esta configuración con el problema de comercio unidireccional (OWT) estudiado en [3]. Sin embargo, nuestros resultados más interesantes examinan el problema comercial de VWAP en un nuevo modelo de negociación en línea que captura el importante fenómeno reciente de los libros de pedidos límite en los mercados financieros. Brevemente, una orden de compra o venta de límite especifica tanto el número de acciones como el precio deseado, y solo se ejecutará si hay una parte correspondiente en el lado opuesto, según un procedimiento de correspondencia bien definido utilizado por todos los intercambios principales. Si bien los libros de órdenes de límite (la lista de órdenes límite que esperan una posible ejecución futura) han existido desde el amanecer de los intercambios de capital, solo recientemente estos libros se han vuelto visibles para los comerciantes en tiempo real, abriendo así el camino a los algoritmos de comercio de todas las variedades que intentanpara explotar estos ricos datos de microestructura de mercado. Dichos datos y algoritmos son un tema de gran interés actual en Wall Street [4]. Por lo tanto, presentamos un nuevo modelo de comercio en línea que incorpora libros de pedidos límite y examinamos los problemas comerciales unidireccionales y VWAP. Nuestros resultados se resumen en la Figura 1 (ver el título para un resumen).2. ThePrice-VolumetradingModel ahora presentamos un modelo de negociación que incluye información de precio y volumen sobre la secuencia de operaciones. Si bien este modelo es una generalización de formalismos anteriores para el comercio en línea, hace una suposición de liquidez infinita que no puede modelar el impacto negativo del mercado que el comercio de una gran cantidad de acciones típicamente tiene. Esto se abordará en el modelo de libro de pedidos estudiado en la siguiente sección. Una nota sobre terminología: en todo el documento (a menos que se especifique lo contrario), utilizaremos el término mercado para describir todas las actividades u órdenes que no sean las del algoritmo bajo consideración. La configuración que consideramos se puede ver como un juego entre nuestro algoritmo y el mercado.2.1 El modelo en el modelo de comercio de precio-volumen, suponemos que la actividad de negociación intradía en una acción determinada se resume mediante una secuencia discreta de pares de precios y volumen (PT, VT) para t = 1 ,..., T. Aquí t = 0 corresponde al mercado de los días abierto, y t = t al cierre. Si bien no hay nada técnicamente especial sobre el horizonte temporal de un solo día, es particularmente consistente con el comercio de la libros de pedidos límite en Wall Street. El par (PT, VT) representa el hecho de que un total de acciones de VT se negociaron a un precio (promedio) por acción PT en el mercado entre el tiempo T - 1 y T.Siendo realistas, debemos imaginar que el número de intervalos t es razonablemente grande, de modo que es sensato asignar un precio aproximado común a todas las acciones negociadas dentro de un intervalo. En el modelo de precio-volumen, haremos una suposición de liquidez infinita para nuestros algoritmos comerciales. Más precisamente, en este modelo en línea, vemos la secuencia de precio-volumen de un par a la vez. Tras la observación de (PT, VT), se nos permite vender cualquier número (posiblemente fraccional) de acciones nt al precio PT. Supongamos que nuestro objetivo es vender n acciones en el transcurso del día. Por lo tanto, en cada momento, debemos seleccionar un número (posiblemente fraccional) de acciones nt para vender al precio PT, sujeto a la restricción global t t = 1 nt = N. Por lo tanto, se supone que si hemos dejado las acciones para venderDespués del tiempo T - 1, nos vemos obligados a venderlos al precio de cierre del mercado, es decir, nt = n - t −1 t = 1 nt se vende en Pt. De esta manera, seguramente venderemos exactamente N acciones en el transcurso del día;Lo único que debe hacer un algoritmo es determinar el cronograma de venta en función de la corriente de precio-volumen de mercado entrante. Cualquier algoritmo que venda volúmenes fraccionales se puede convertir a un algoritmo aleatorizado que solo vende volúmenes integrales con el mismo número esperado de acciones vendidas. Si mantenemos la difícil restricción de vender exactamente N acciones, podríamos incurrir en una ligera pérdida adicional en la conversión.(Tenga en cuenta que solo permitimos volúmenes fraccionales en el modelo de precio-volumen, donde la liquidez no es un problema. En el modelo de libro de pedidos a seguir, no permitimos volúmenes fraccionales). En el comercio de VWAP, el objetivo de un algoritmo en línea A que vende exactamente n acciones no es maximizar las ganancias per se, sino rastrear el mercado VWAP. El mercado VWAP para una secuencia de negociación intradía S = (P1, V1) ,..., (PT, VT) es simplemente el precio promedio pagado por acción en el transcurso de la negociación de 190 días, es decir, VWAPM (S) = T T = 1 PTVT /V donde V es el volumen diario total, es decir, V = T T T= 1 Vt. Si en la secuencia S, el algoritmo A vende sus acciones N usando la secuencia de volumen N1 ,...NT, luego definimos análogos el VWAP de A en la secuencia de mercado S por VWAPA (S) = T T = 1 PTNT /N. Tenga en cuenta que el mercado VWAP no incluye las acciones que vende el algoritmo. La relación competitiva VWAP de A con respecto a un conjunto de secuencias σ es entonces rvwap (a) = max s∈σ {vwapm (s)/vwapa (s)} en el caso de que a se aleatoriza, generalizamos la definición anterior porTomando una expectativa sobre VWAPA dentro del máximo. Notamos que, a diferencia de Wall Street, nuestra definición de VWAPM no tiene en cuenta nuestro propio comercio. Es fácil ver que esto lo convierte en un criterio más desafiante para rastrear. En contraste con el VWAP, otra medida común del rendimiento de un algoritmo de venta en línea sería su relación competitiva de comercio unidireccional (OWT) [3] con respecto a un conjunto de secuencias σ: Rowt (A) = Max S∈σmax 1≤t≤t {PT/VWAPA (S)} Cuando el rendimiento de los algoritmos se compara con el precio individual más grande que aparece en la secuencia S. tanto en VWAP como en OWT, estamos comparando el precio promedio por acción recibido por un algoritmo de ventaa alguna medida del desempeño del mercado. En el caso de OWT, nos comparamos con el punto de referencia bastante ambicioso del alto precio del día, ignorando por completo los volúmenes. En el comercio de VWAP, tenemos el objetivo más modesto de comparar favorablemente con el promedio general del mercado del día. Como veremos, hay algunos puntos en común importantes y diferencias en estos dos enfoques. Por ahora notamos un hecho simple: en cualquier secuencia específica, VWAPA puede ser mayor que VWAPM (s). Sin embargo, RVWAP (a) no puede ser menor que 1, ya que en cualquier secuencia s en la que todos los precios son idénticos, es imposible obtener una mejor participación promedio por precio. Por lo tanto, para todos los algoritmos A, tanto RVWAP (a) como Rowt (a) son mayores que 1, y cuanto más cerca de 1 están, mejor A está rastreando su medida de rendimiento respectiva.2.2 Los resultados de VWAP en el modelo de precio-volumen como en el trabajo previo en el comercio en línea, generalmente no es posible obtener límites finitos en relaciones competitivas con absolutamente ninguna suposición en el conjunto de secuencias σbounds en la variación máxima en el precio o el volumen se requieren,dependiendo de la configuración exacta. Por lo tanto, presentamos los siguientes dos supuestos.2.2.0.1 Asunción de variabilidad de volumen .. Supongamos 0 <vmin ≤ vmax constantes positivas conocidas y defina q = vmax /vmin. Para todas las secuencias de comercio intradía s ∈ σ, el volumen diario total v ∈ [vmin, vmax].2.2.0.2 Asunción de variabilidad del precio .. Supongamos 0 <pmin ≤ PMAX se conozca constantes positivas y defina R = PMAX/PMIN. Para todas las secuencias de comercio intradía s ∈ σ, los precios satisfacen pt ∈ [pmin, pMax], para todos t = 1 ,..., T. Las relaciones competitivas generalmente se toman sobre todos los conjuntos σ consistentes con al menos uno de estos supuestos. Para obtener alguna intuición, considere los dos casos triviales de r = 1 y Q = 1. En el caso de r = 1 (donde no hay fluctuación en el precio), cualquier horario es óptimo. En el caso de Q = 1 (donde se conoce el volumen V total durante el período de negociación), podemos obtener una relación competitiva de 1 vendiendo acciones VT V N después de cada período de tiempo. Para el problema de OWT en el modelo de precio-volumen, los volúmenes son irrelevantes para el criterio de rendimiento, pero para el criterio VWAP son centrales. Para el problema de OWT bajo la suposición de variabilidad del precio, los resultados de [3] establecieron que la relación competitiva óptima fue θ (log (R)). Nuestro primer resultado establece que la relación competitiva óptima para VWAP bajo la suposición de variabilidad de volumen es θ (log (Q)) y se logra mediante un algoritmo que ignora los datos de precios. Teorema 1. En el modelo de precio-volumen bajo el supuesto de variabilidad de volumen, existe un algoritmo en línea A para vender n acciones que logren la relación competitiva RVWAP (a) ≤ 2 log (q). Además, si solo la suposición de la variabilidad del volumen (y no la variabilidad del precio) se mantiene, cualquier algoritmo en línea A para vender n acciones tiene RVWAP (a) = ω (log (q)). Prueba.(Boceto) Para el límite superior, la idea es similar al algoritmo de reserva de precios de [3] para el problema de OWT, y similar en espíritu a la técnica general de clasificar y seleccionar [1]. Considere algoritmos que usan un parámetro ˆV, que se interpreta como una estimación para el volumen total para el día. Luego, en cada momento t, si el precio y el volumen de mercado son (PT, VT), el algoritmo vende una fracción VT/ ˆV de sus acciones. Consideramos una familia de log (q) tales algoritmos, donde el algoritmo ai usa ˆv = vmin 2i - 1. Claramente, una de las IA tiene una relación competitiva de 2. Podemos obtener una relación competitiva O (log (Q)) VWAP ejecutando estos algoritmos en paralelo y permitiendo que cada algoritmo venda las acciones de N/ log (Q).(Alternativamente, podemos seleccionar aleatoriamente una IA y garantizar la misma relación competitiva esperada). Ahora dibujamos la prueba del límite inferior, que relaciona el rendimiento en los problemas de VWAP y OWT. Cualquier algoritmo que sea competitivo en C en la configuración VWAP (en Q fijo) es competitivo 3C en la configuración OWT con R = Q/2. Para mostrar esto, tomamos cualquier secuencia de precios para el problema de OWT y lo convertimos en una secuencia de precio-volumen para el problema VWAP. Los precios en la secuencia VWAP son los mismos que en S. para construir los volúmenes en la secuencia VWAP, segmentamos los precios en S en intervalos log (R) [2i - 1 pmin, 2i pmin). Supongamos que pt ∈ [2i - 1 pmin, 2i pmin), y esta es la primera vez en s que un precio ha caído en este intervalo. Luego, en la secuencia VWAP, establecemos el volumen VT = 2i - 1. Si esta no es la primera visita al intervalo que contiene PT, establecemos VT = 0. Suponga que el precio máximo en S es PMAX. El VWAP de nuestra secuencia es al menos PMAX /3. Como teníamos un algoritmo competitivo C, su venta promedio es al menos PMAX /3C. El límite inferior ahora sigue usando el límite inferior en [3]. Un enfoque alternativo para VWAP es ignorar los volúmenes a favor de los precios y aplicar un algoritmo para el problema de OWT. Tenga en cuenta que el límite inferior en este teorema, a diferencia del anterior, solo supone un límite de variación de precios.191 Teorema 2. En el modelo de precio-volumen bajo la suposición de variabilidad del precio, existe un algoritmo en línea A para vender n acciones que logran la relación competitiva RVWAP (a) = o (log (R)). Además, si solo la suposición de la variabilidad del precio (y no la variabilidad del volumen) se mantiene, cualquier A en línea A para vender n acciones tiene RVWAP (a) = Ω (log (R)). Prueba.(Sketch) sigue inmediatamente de los resultados de [3] para OWT: el límite superior del hecho simple de que para cualquier secuencia S, VWAPA (S) es menor que Max1≤t≤t {Pt}, y el límite inferior de AReducción a Owt. Los teoremas 1 y 2 demuestran que se pueden lograr relaciones competitivas LOGARITMIC VWAP bajo el supuesto de variabilidad limitada del volumen total o la variabilidad limitada del precio máximo. Si ambos supuestos se mantienen, es posible dar un algoritmo que logre el mínimo de log (q) y log (r). Esta flexibilidad de enfoque se deriva del hecho de que el VWAP es una cantidad en la que tanto los precios como los volúmenes son importantes, en oposición a OWT.2.3 RELACIONADOS Los algoritmos VWAP que hemos discutido hasta ahora hemos discutido que hasta ahora aprovechan los datos diarios (PT, VT) a medida que se desarrolla, utilizando la información de precio o volumen. Por el contrario, un algoritmo de programación fijo VWAP tiene una distribución predeterminada {F1, F2 ,...ft}, y simplemente vende acciones FTN en el tiempo T, independientemente de (PT, VT). El horario fijo de los algoritmos VWAP, o ligeras variantes de ellos, son sorprendentemente comunes en Wall Street, y el horario generalmente se deriva de los datos históricos de volumen intrainal. Nuestro siguiente resultado demuestra que tales algoritmos pueden funcionar considerablemente peor que los algoritmos dinámicamente adaptativos en términos de la razón competitiva en el peor de los casos. Teorema 3. En el modelo de precio-volumen bajo los supuestos de variabilidad de volumen y precio, cualquier algoritmo de programa VWAP de programación fija A para vender n acciones ha vendido VWAP Ratio competitivo RVWAP (A) = Ω (Min (T, R)). Las pruebas de todos los resultados en esta subsección están en el apéndice. Hasta ahora, nuestro énfasis ha sido en los algoritmos VWAP que deben vender exactamente n acciones. Sin embargo, en muchas circunstancias realistas, en realidad hay cierta flexibilidad en el número preciso de acciones que se venden. Por ejemplo, esto es cierto en grandes casas de bolsa, donde muchas operaciones VWAP separadas pueden ser agrupadas y ejecutadas por un algoritmo común, y la empresa estaría bastante dispuesta a llevar una pequeña posición de acciones no vendidas durante la noche si resultó en mejores precios de ejecución. El siguiente teorema (que curiosamente no tiene análogo para el problema de OWT) demuestra que esta compensación en las acciones vendidas y el rendimiento se puede realizar dramáticamente en nuestro modelo. Establece que si estamos dispuestos a dejar que el número de acciones vendidas varíe con Q, de hecho podemos lograr una relación competitiva VWAP de 1. Teorema 4. En el modelo de precio-volumen bajo el supuesto de variabilidad de volumen, existe un algoritmo A que siempre vende entre las acciones N y QN y que el precio promedio por acción vendida es exactamente VWAPM (s). En muchos problemas en línea, existe una clara distinción entre problemas de beneficios y problemas de costos [2]. En el entorno VWAP, vender acciones es un problema de beneficios, y comprar acciones es un problema de costo. Las definiciones de las proporciones competitivas, RBuy VWAP (A) y Rbuy Owt (A), para algoritmos que Figura 2: muestra de libros de orden de islas para MSFT.Comprar exactamente n acciones son maxs∈σ {VWAPA (S)/VWAPM (S)} y maxs∈σ maxt {vwapa (s)/pt} respectivamente. A pesar de que el Teorema 4 también es válido para comprar, en general, la relación competitiva del problema de compra (costo) es mucho mayor, como se indica en el siguiente teorema. Teorema 5. En el modelo de volumen de precio bajo los supuestos de variabilidad de volumen y precio, existe un algoritmo en línea A para comprar n acciones que logran comprar una relación competitiva VWAP rbuy vwap (a) = o (min {q, √ r}). Además, cualquier algoritmo en línea a para comprar n acciones ha comprado VWAP Ratio competitiva RBuy VWAP (a) = Ω (min {Q, √ r}).3. Un modelo de comercio de libros de pedidos límite antes de que podamos definir nuestro modelo de negociación en línea basado en los libros de pedidos límite, damos algunos antecedentes necesarios sobre la mecánica detallada de los mercados financieros, que a veces se denominan microestructura del mercado. Luego proporcionamos resultados y algoritmos para los problemas OWT y VWAP.192 3.1 Antecedentes sobre los libros de pedidos límite y la microestructura del mercado Una distinción fundamental en el comercio de acciones es que entre una orden límite y una orden de mercado. Supongamos que deseamos comprar 1000 acciones de Microsoft (MSFT). En una orden límite, especificamos no solo el volumen deseado (1000 acciones), sino también el precio deseado. Suponga que MSFT se cotiza actualmente a aproximadamente $ 24.07 por acción (ver Figura 2, que muestra una instantánea real de un libro de pedidos de MSFT reciente en Island (www.island.com), un bien conocido intercambio electrónico para las acciones de NASDAQ), pero nosotrosSolo están dispuestos a comprar las 1000 acciones a $ 24.04 por acción o inferior. Podemos elegir enviar una orden de límite con esta especificación, y nuestro pedido se realizará en una cola llamada Buy Order Libro, que está ordenado por Price, con el precio de compra sin ejecutación más alto ofrecido en la parte superior (a menudo denominada oferta). Si hay múltiples órdenes límite al mismo precio, se ordenan por tiempo de llegada (con pedidos más antiguos más altos en el libro). En el ejemplo proporcionado por la Figura 2, nuestro pedido se realizaría inmediatamente después del pedido existente para 5,503 acciones a $ 24.04;Aunque ofrecemos el mismo precio, este pedido ha llegado antes del nuestro. Del mismo modo, se mantiene un libro de pedidos de venta para pedidos límite de venta (por ejemplo, es posible que deseemos vender 500 acciones de MSFT a $ 24.10 o más), esta vez con el precio de venta más bajo ofrecido (a menudo denominado solicitado). Por lo tanto, los libros de pedidos se clasifican desde los pedidos límite más competitivos en la parte superior (altos precios de compra y bajos precios de venta) hasta pedidos límite menos competitivos. Los precios de oferta y solicitud (que nuevamente son simplemente los precios en los pedidos límite en la parte superior de los libros de compra y venta, respectivamente) a veces se conoce como el mercado interno, y la diferencia entre ellos como el diferencial. Por definición, los libros de pedidos siempre consisten exclusivamente en órdenes no ejecutadas: son colas de pedidos, con suerte, que esperan que el precio se mueva en su dirección. ¿Cómo se ejecutan entonces los pedidos? Hay dos métodos. Primero, cada vez que llega una orden de mercado, se combina inmediatamente con las órdenes límite más competitivas en el libro opuesto. Por lo tanto, una orden de mercado para comprar 2000 acciones se combina con suficiente volumen en la libreta de pedidos de venta para llenar las 2000 acciones. Por ejemplo, en el ejemplo de la Figura 2, dicha orden se cumpliría con las dos órdenes de venta límite para 500 acciones a $ 24.069, las 500 acciones a $ 24.07, las 200 acciones a $ 24.08 y luego 300 de las acciones de 1981 a $ 24.09. Las 1681 acciones restantes de este último pedido de límite permanecerían como el nuevo libro de pedidos de límite de venta. En segundo lugar, si una orden de límite de compra (vender, respectivamente) llega por encima del precio de solicitud (por debajo de la oferta, respectivamente), entonces el pedido coincide con los pedidos en los libros opuestos. Es importante tener en cuenta que los precios de las ejecuciones son los precios especificados en los pedidos límite que ya están en los libros, no los precios de la orden entrante que se ejecuta inmediatamente. Cada mercado o orden límite llega atómica e instantáneamente: hay una secuencia temporal estricta en la que llegan las órdenes, y dos órdenes nunca pueden llegar simultáneamente. Esto da lugar a la definición del último precio del intercambio, que es simplemente el último precio al que el intercambio ejecutó un pedido. Es esta cantidad la que generalmente se entiende cuando las personas se refieren casualmente al precio (de ticker) de una acción. Tenga en cuenta que una orden de compra de límite (vender, respectivamente) con un precio de infinito (0, respectivamente) es efectivamente una orden de mercado. Por lo tanto, asumiremos sin pérdida de generalidad que todos los pedidos se colocan como orden de límite. Aunque las órdenes límite que no se ejecutan pueden ser eliminadas por la parte que las colocó, por simplicidad, suponemos que las órdenes límite nunca se eliminan de los libros. Remitimos al lector a [4] para una discusión adicional de los intercambios electrónicos modernos y la microestructura del mercado.3.2 El modelo El modelo de comercio de libros de pedidos en línea está destinado a capturar los detalles realistas de la microestructura del mercado que recién discutido en una configuración de relación competitiva. En este modelo refinado, una actividad del mercado de días se describe mediante una secuencia de órdenes límite (PT, VT, BT). Aquí BT indica un poco si el pedido es un pedido de compra o venta, mientras que PT es el precio del pedido límite y la VT el número de acciones deseadas. Después de la llegada de cada orden límite, se permite que un algoritmo de negociación en línea realice su propio pedido de límite. Estas dos fuentes entrelazadas (mercado y algoritmo) de las órdenes límite simplemente se operan de acuerdo con el proceso de correspondencia descrito en la Sección 3.1. Cualquier orden de límite que no sea ejecutable de inmediato de acuerdo con este proceso se coloca en el libro apropiado (comprar o vender) para una posible ejecución futura;Las órdenes de llegada que pueden ejecutarse parcial o completamente se ejecutan así, con cualquier acción residual restante en el libro respectivo. El objetivo de un algoritmo de venta de VWAP o OWT es esencialmente el mismo que en el modelo de precio-volumen, pero el contexto ha cambiado en las siguientes dos formas fundamentales. Primero, la suposición de liquidez infinita en el modelo de precio-volumen se elimina por completo. El número de acciones disponibles a un precio dado está restringido al volumen total de pedidos límite que ofrecen ese precio. En segundo lugar, se supone que todas las órdenes entrantes y, por lo tanto, los libros de pedidos de límite completos son visibles para el algoritmo. Esto es consistente con los modernos intercambios financieros electrónicos, y de hecho es la fuente de mucho interés actual en Wall Street [4]. En general, la definición de relaciones competitivas en el modelo de libro de pedidos se complica por el hecho de que ahora nuestra actividad de algoritmos influye en la secuencia de precios y volúmenes ejecutados. Por lo tanto, primero definimos la secuencia de ejecución determinada por una secuencia de orden límite (colocada por el mercado y nuestro algoritmo). Sea s = (p1, v1, b1) ,..., (Pt, VT, Bt) ser una secuencia de orden límite colocada por el mercado, y dejar S = (P1, V1, B1) ,..., (PT, VT, BT) ser una secuencia de orden límite colocada por nuestro algoritmo (a menos que se especifique lo contrario, todos los BT son del tipo de venta). Sea la fusión (s, s) la secuencia fusionada (p1, v1, b1), (p1, v1, b1) ,..., (PT, VT, BT), (PT, VT, BT), que es la secuencia de tiempo de pedidos realizados por el mercado y el algoritmo. Tenga en cuenta que el algoritmo tiene la opción de no realizar un pedido, que podemos ver como un orden de volumen cero. Si realizamos el proceso de mantenimiento y ejecución de pedidos del libro de pedidos descrito en la Sección 3.1 en los fusiones de secuencia (s, s), a intervalos irregulares se produce una operación para una cantidad de acciones y algún precio. En cada comercio ejecutado, la fiesta de venta es el mercado o el algoritmo. Sea execm (s, s) = (q1, w1) ,..., (Qt, WT) será la secuencia de ejecuciones donde el mercado (es decir, una parte que no sea el algoritmo) fue la parte vendida, donde el QT son los precios de la ejecución y los volúmenes de ejecución. Del mismo modo, definimos ExecA (S, S) = (R1, X1) ,..., (RT, XT) para ser la secuencia de ejecuciones en la que el algoritmo era la fiesta de venta. Por lo tanto, ExecA (S, S) ∪ ExecM (S, S) es el conjunto de todas las ejecuciones. Generalmente esperamos que T sea (posiblemente mucho) más pequeño que T. Los ingresos del algoritmo y el mercado se definen 193 como: Revm (S, S) ≡ T T = 1 Qtwt, Reva (S, S) ≡ T T = 1 RTXT Tenga en cuenta que ambas cantidades están determinadas únicamente por las secuencias de ejecuciónExecM (S, S) y Execa (S, S), respectivamente. Para un algoritmo A que está obligado a vender exactamente n acciones, definimos la relación competitiva OWT de A, Rowt (a), como la relación máxima (bajo cualquier S ∈ σ) de los ingresos obtenidos por A, en comparación con los ingresosobtenido por un algoritmo ﬄ ine optim ﬄ ﬄ ﬄ ﬄ a ∗. Más formalmente, para un ∗ que está limitado a vender exactamente n acciones, definimos a Rowt (a) = max s∈σ max a ∗ reva ∗ (s s ∗) reva (s, s) donde s ∗ es la secuencia de orden límite colocadopor A ∗ sobre S. Si el algoritmo A se aleatoriza, entonces tomamos la expectativa apropiada con respecto a S ∼ A. Definimos la relación competitiva VWAP, RVWAP (A), como la relación máxima (bajo cualquier S ∈ σ) entre el mercado y el algoritmo VWAPS. Más formalmente, defina VWAPM (S, S) como RevM (S, S)/ T T = 1 WT, donde el denominador es solo el volumen total ejecutado de pedidos realizados por el mercado. Del mismo modo, definimos VWAPA (S, S) como RevA (S, S)/N, ya que asumimos que el algoritmo no vende más de N acciones (esta definición supone implícitamente que A obtiene un precio de 0 por acciones no vendidas). La relación competitiva VWAP de A es entonces: rvwap (a) = max s∈σ {vwapm (s, s)/vwapa (s, s)} donde s es la secuencia en línea de órdenes límite generados por A en respuesta a la secuenciaS. 3.3 Resultados de OWT en el modelo de libro de pedidos para el problema de OWT En el modelo de libro de pedidos, presentamos una versión más sutil de la suposición de variabilidad del precio. Esto se debe al hecho de que nuestro comercio de algoritmos puede afectar los precios altos y bajos del día. Para el siguiente supuesto, tenga en cuenta que Execm (S, ∅) es la secuencia de ejecuciones sin la interacción de nuestro algoritmo.3.3.0. Para todas las secuencias de comercio intradía s ∈ σ, los precios Pt en la secuencia EXECM (S, ∅) satisfacen pt ∈ [PMIN, PMAX], para todos t = 1 ,..., T. Tenga en cuenta que esta suposición no implica que las proporciones de precios altos a bajos bajo las secuencias execm (s, s) o execa (s, s, s) estén limitadas por R. De hecho, la relación en la secuencia EXECA (s, S) podría ser infinito si el algoritmo termina vendiendo algunas acciones a un precio de 0. Teorema 6. En el modelo de libro de pedidos bajo la suposición de variabilidad del precio del libro de pedidos, existe un algoritmo en línea A para vender n acciones que logran vender una relación competitiva Rowt (a) = 2 registro (R) log (n). Prueba. El algoritmo A funciona adivinando un precio P en el conjunto {pmin2i: 1 ≤ i ≤ log (r)} y colocando una orden de límite de venta para todas las acciones al precio P al comienzo del día.(Alternativamente, el algoritmo A puede colocar log (R) Vender órdenes límite, donde el i-th One tiene el precio 2i pmin y volumen n/ log (r).). Al realizar un pedido al comienzo del día, el algoritmo socava todas las órdenes de venta que se realizarán durante el día por un precio de P o superior, lo que significa que los algoritmos de las acciones de N deben completarse primero a este precio. Por lo tanto, si hubiera K acciones que se habrían vendido al precio P o más sin nuestra actividad, entonces A vendería al menos acciones de KP. Definimos {PJ} para ser el multiset de precios de acciones individuales que se ejecutan o son acciones de orden de límite de compra que permanecieron sin ejecución, excluyendo la actividad de nuestro algoritmo (es decir, suponiendo que nuestro algoritmo no realice órdenes). Suponga sin pérdida de generalidad que p1 ≥ p2 ≥.... Considere adivinar el KTH más alto de este precio, PK. Si se realiza un pedido para N de N en los días que comienza en Price PK, entonces tenemos la garantía de obtener una devolución de KPK. Sea k ∗ = argmaxk {kpk}. Podemos ver que nuestro algoritmo intenta adivinar PK ∗, y tener éxito si la suposición P satisface p ∈ [PK ∗ /2, PK ∗]. Por lo tanto, somos 2 log (r) competitivos con la cantidad max1≤k≤n kpk. Tenga en cuenta que ρ ≡ n i = 1 pi = n i = 1 1 i ie ≤ max 1≤k≤kn kpk n i = 1 1 1 i ≤ log (n) max 1≤k≤k ≤k kpk donde ρ se define como la sumade los principales precios n Pi sin asignación. Del mismo modo, Sea {PJ} la multisetea de precios de acciones ejecutadas individuales, o los precios de las acciones de pedidos de compra no ejecutadas, pero ahora incluyen los pedidos realizados por algunos algoritmo de venta a. Ahora deseamos mostrar que para todos los algoritmos A que venden n acciones, reva ≤ n i = 1 pi ≤ ρ. Esencialmente, esta desigualdad establece la idea intuitiva de que un algoritmo de venta solo puede reducir los precios de las acciones de compra ejecutados o inigualables. Para probar esto, utilizamos la inducción para demostrar que la eliminación de la actividad de un algoritmo de venta hace que estos precios aumenten. Primero, elimine la última acción en el último orden de venta realizado por un mercado o el mercado en una (s, s) secuencia arbitraria (s); con esto, queremos decir, tome el último orden de venta realizado por un mercado y disminuya su volumen poruna acción. Después de esta modificación, los principales n precios p1...PN no disminuirá. Esto se debe a que esta parte de la orden de venta no se ejecutó, en cuyo caso el reclamo es trivialmente verdadero o, si se ejecutó, la eliminación de esta acción de orden de venta deja una acción de compra no ejecutada adicional de igual o mayor precio. Para la inducción, suponga que si eliminamos una acción de cualquier orden de venta que fue realizado, por un mercado, en o después de tiempo t, los precios principales no disminuyen. Ahora mostramos que si eliminamos una acción de la última orden de venta que fue realizada por A o el mercado antes del tiempo T, entonces los principales precios no disminuyen. Si esta acción de pedido de venta no se ejecutó, entonces el reclamo es trivialmente cierto. Más, si se ejecutó la acción de la orden de venta, entonces el reclamo es verdadero porque al eliminar esta acción ejecutada de la orden de venta, ya sea: i) La participación de la orden de compra correspondiente (de igual o valor más alto) no tiene comparación en el resto de la secuencia, en¿Qué caso el reclamo es verdadero?o ii) Esta compra de 194 coincide con algunas acciones de pedidos de venta a un precio igual o superior, lo que tiene el efecto de eliminar una acción de una orden de venta en el resto de la secuencia y, por la suposición inductiva, esto solo puede aumentar los precios. Por lo tanto, hemos demostrado que para todos los que venden n acciones reva ≤ ρ. Ahora hemos establecido que nuestros ingresos satisfacen 2 log (r) es ∼A [reva (s, s)] ≥ max 1≤k≤n {kpk} ≥ ρ/ log (n) ≥ max a {reva}/ log (N), donde A realiza una secuencia arbitraria de N órdenes de límite de venta de N.3.4 Resultados de VWAP En el modelo de libro de pedidos, el algoritmo OWT del Teorema 6 se puede aplicar para obtener el siguiente resultado de VWAP: Corolario 7. En el modelo de libro de pedidos bajo la suposición de variabilidad del precio del libro de pedidos, existe un algoritmo en línea A para vender n acciones que logran VWAP Ratio competitivo RVWAP (a) = O (log (R) log (n)). Ahora hacemos una suposición bastante diferente en las secuencias S. 3.4.0.4 Volumen de pedido limitado y suposición máxima de precios. El conjunto de secuencias σ satisface las siguientes dos propiedades. Primero, suponemos que cada pedido realizado por el mercado es de volumen menor que γ, lo que consideramos una suposición leve, ya que típicamente los pedidos individuales en el mercado no son de alto volumen (debido a problemas de liquidez). Esta suposición permite que nuestro algoritmo coloque al menos una orden de límite a la vez entrelazada con aproximadamente ejecuciones de mercado de γ. En segundo lugar, suponemos que hay un gran volumen en los libros de pedidos de venta por debajo del precio PMAX, lo que significa que ningún pedido realizado por el mercado se ejecutará por encima del precio PMAX. La forma más sencilla de instanciar esta última suposición en el modelo de libro de pedidos es suponer que cada secuencia s ∈ σ comienza colocando una gran cantidad de órdenes de venta (más que Vmax) al precio PMAX. Aunque esta suposición tiene un parámetro de precio máximo, no implica que el índice de precios sea finito, ya que no implica ningún límite inferior en los precios de las acciones de compra o ejecutada (aparte del trivial de 0). Teorema 8. Considere el modelo de libro de pedidos bajo el volumen de pedido limitado y suposición de precio máximo. Existe un algoritmo A en el que se han producido exactamente las ejecuciones de mercado de γn, luego A se ha vendido como máximo n acciones y reva (s, s) n = vwapa (s, s) ≥ (1 -) VWAPM (S, S) -PMAX n donde s es una secuencia de n órdenes de límite de venta generados por A al observar la prueba S. El algoritmo divide el día de negociación en intervalos de volumen cuya duración en tiempo real puede variar. Para cada período I en el que se han ejecutado las acciones γ en el mercado, el algoritmo calcula el mercado VWAP de solo aquellas acciones negociadas en el período I;Denotemos esto por Vwapi. Después de este intervalo de volumen, el algoritmo coloca una orden límite para vender exactamente una acción a un precio cercano a VWAPI. Más precisamente, el algoritmo solo realiza pedidos a los precios discretos (1-) PMAX, (1-) 2 PMAX ,.... Después del intervalo de volumen I, el algoritmo coloca una orden límite para vender una acción al precio discretizado que está más cerca de VWAPI, pero que es estrictamente más pequeño. Para el análisis, comenzamos señalando que si todas las órdenes de límite de algoritmos se ejecutan durante el día, los ingresos totales recibidos por el algoritmo serían al menos (1 -) VWAPM (S, S) n.Para ver esto, es suficiente tener en cuenta que VWAPM (S, S) es una mezcla uniforme del VWAPI (ya que, por definición, cubren la misma cantidad de volumen del mercado);Y si se ejecutaron todas las órdenes de límite de algoritmos, cada una recibió más de (1 -) dólares VWAPI para el intervalo que siguieron. Ahora contamos los posibles ingresos perdidos del algoritmo debido a las órdenes límite no ejecutadas. Suponiendo que las órdenes individuales se colocan con un volumen inferior a γ, entonces nuestro algoritmo puede colocar una orden límite durante cada bloque de acciones γ. Por lo tanto, después de que se han ejecutado órdenes de mercado de γN, A ha realizado n pedidos en el mercado. Tenga en cuenta que puede haber como máximo un orden límite (y por lo tanto, a lo sumo una acción) que no se ejecutan en cada nivel de la escalera de precios discretizada definida anteriormente. Esto se debe a que después del intervalo I, el algoritmo coloca su orden de límite estrictamente debajo de VWAPI, por lo que si VWAPJ ≥ VWAPI para J> I, este orden límite debe haber sido ejecutado. Por lo tanto, las órdenes límite no ejecutadas vinculan los VWAP del resto del día, lo que resulta en una orden no ejecutada por nivel de precio. Un límite en los ingresos perdidos es, por lo tanto, la suma de los precios discretizados: ∞ i = 1 (1 -) I PMAX ≤ PMAX /. Claramente, nuestro algoritmo se ha vendido como máximo n acciones. Tenga en cuenta que a medida que N se vuelve grande, VWAPA se acerca 1, veces el mercado VWAP. Si supiéramos que el volumen total final de las ejecuciones de mercado es V, entonces podemos establecer γ = V/N, suponiendo que γ >> 1. Si solo tenemos un límite superior e inferior en V, deberíamos poder adivinar e incurrir en una pérdida logarítmica. El siguiente supuesto intenta capturar la variabilidad del volumen del mercado.3.4.0.5 Supuesto de variabilidad de volumen de libros de pedidos. Ahora suponemos que el volumen total (que incluye las acciones ejecutadas por nuestro algoritmo y el mercado) es variable dentro de alguna región conocida y que el volumen del mercado será mayor que nuestro volumen de algoritmos. Más formalmente, para todos los s ∈ σ, suponga que el volumen total V de las acciones negociadas en execm (s, s), para cualquier secuencia s de n órdenes de límite de venta, satisface 2n ≤ vmin ≤ v ≤ vmax. Sea q = vmax /vmin. El siguiente corolario se deriva usando una constante = 1/2 y observando que si establecemos γ de modo que v ≤ γn ≤ 2V, entonces nuestro algoritmo se colocará entre las órdenes de límite N y N/2. Corolario 9. En el modelo de Libro de pedidos, si el volumen de pedido limitado y el supuesto de precio máximo, y la suposición de la variabilidad del volumen del libro de pedidos se mantiene, existe un algoritmo en línea A para vender como máximo n acciones, de modo que VWAPA (S, S) ≥ 1 4 log (Q) VWAPM (S, S) - 2pmax n 195 0 2 4 6 8 x 10 7 0 20 40 60 80 100 QQQ: log (q) = 4.71, e = 3.77 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 6 0 20 4060 80 jnpr: log (Q) = 5.66, e = 3.97 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 6 0 10 20 30 40 50 50 60 70 MCHP: log (q) = 5.28, e = 3.86 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 106 0 50 100 100 150 200 250 CHKP: Log (Q) = 6.56, E = 4.50 Figura 3: Aquí presentamos límites de la Sección 4 basados en las distribuciones de volumen empírico para cuatro existencias reales: QQQ, MCHP, JNPR y CHKP. Las gráficas muestran histogramas para los volúmenes diarios totales transaccados en la isla para estas acciones, en el último año y medio, junto con los valores correspondientes de log (Q) y E (PBINS VOL) (denotado por E). Suponemos que los volúmenes diarios mínimos y máximos en los datos corresponden a Vmin y VMAX, respectivamente. Los límites de relación competitivos en el peor de los casos (que son dos veces log (Q)) de nuestro algoritmo para esas acciones son 9.42, 10.56, 11.32 y 13.20, respectivamente. Los límites correspondientes en el rendimiento de la relación competitiva de nuestro algoritmo bajo el modelo de distribución de volumen (que son dos veces E (PBINS vol)) son mejores: 7.54, 7.72, 7.94 y 9.00, respectivamente (una mejora relativa del 20-40%). Usando un binning de volumen más fino junto con un límite ligeramente más refinado en la relación competitiva, podemos construir algoritmos que, utilizando la distribución de volumen empírico dada como correcta, garantizan relaciones competitivas aún mejores de 2.76, 2.73, 2.75 y 3.17, respectivamente para aquellosacciones (detalles omitidos).4. Modelos de distribución macroscópica Concluimos nuestros resultados con un retorno al modelo de precio-volumen, donde introduciremos algunos métodos de análisis refinados para los algoritmos de comercio en línea. Dejamos la generalización de estos métodos al modelo de libro de pedidos para el trabajo futuro. Las proporciones competitivas definidas hasta ahora miden el rendimiento en relación con algún criterio de referencia en el peor de los casos en todas las secuencias de mercado s ∈ σ. Se ha observado en muchos entornos en línea que tales métricas en el peor de los casos pueden producir resultados pesimistas, y se han considerado varias relajaciones, como permitir una distribución de probabilidad sobre la secuencia de entrada. Ahora consideramos modelos de distribución que son considerablemente más débiles que asumir una distribución sobre secuencias de mercado completas s ∈ σ. En el modelo de distribución de volumen, suponemos que solo existe un PVOL de distribución sobre el volumen total V comercializado en el mercado por el día, y luego examinamos la relación competitiva en el peor de los casos sobre las secuencias consistentes con el volumen elegido al azar. Más precisamente, definimos RVWAP (A, PVOL) = EV ∼Pvol Max S∈Seq (V) VWAPM (S) VWAPA (S). Aquí V ∼ Pvol denota que V se elige con respecto a la distribución PVOL, y SEQ (V) ⊂ σ es el conjunto de todas las secuencias de mercado (P1, V1) ,..., (pt, vt) satisfactorio t t = 1 vt = v. Del mismo modo, para OWT, podemos definir ROWT (A, PMAXPRICE) = EP∼PMaxPrice Max S∈Seq (P) P VWAPA (S). Aquí PMAXPRICE es una distribución sobre el precio máximo del día, y luego examinamos las peores secuencias consistentes con este precio (SEQ (P) ⊂ σ es el conjunto de todas las secuencias de mercado que satisfacen max1≤t≤t pt = p). Se pueden dar definiciones análogas al lado de la compra. Hacemos hincapié en que en estos modelos, el algoritmo conoce la distribución del volumen y el precio máximo. También observamos que nuestros supuestos probabilísticos en S son considerablemente más débiles que los modelos de financiación estadística típica, lo que plantearía un modelo estocástico detallado para la evolución paso a paso de (PT, VT). Aquí, en su lugar, permitimos solo una distribución sobre las medidas crudas y macroscópicas de la actividad del mercado de los días enteros, como el volumen total y el alto precio, y analizamos el peor rendimiento de los casos consistentes con estas medidas crudas. Por esta razón, nos referimos a la configuración como el modelo de distribución macroscópica. El trabajo de El-Yaniv et al.[3] examina las suposiciones de distribución similares a las nuestras, pero también enfatizan las opciones de casos peor196 para las distribuciones, y muestran que esto conduce a los resultados no mejores que el análisis original del peor de los casos en todas las secuencias. En contraste, creemos que el análisis de distribuciones específicas PVOL y PMAXPRICE es natural en muchos contextos financieros y nuestros resultados experimentales preliminares muestran mejoras significativas cuando se tiene en cuenta esta información de distribución más bien cruda (ver Figura 3). Nuestros resultados en la configuración de VWAP examinan los casos en que estas distribuciones se conocen exactamente o solo aproximadamente. Se pueden obtener resultados similares para las distribuciones macroscópicas del precio diario máximo para el entorno de negociación unidireccional.4.1 Resulta en el modelo de distribución macroscópica, comenzamos señalando que los algoritmos examinados hasta ahora funcionan agrupando volúmenes totales o precios máximos en contenedores de tamaño exponencialmente aumentando, y luego adivinando el índice del contenedor en el que cae la cantidad real. Por lo tanto, es natural que el rendimiento del modelo de distribución macroscópica de tales algoritmos (que son comunes en el análisis competitivo) puedan depender de la distribución del índice de bin verdadero. En el resto, suponemos que Q es un poder de 2 y la base del logaritmo es 2. Deje que PVOL denote la distribución del volumen total del mercado diario. Definimos la distribución relacionada Pbins Vol sobre los índices de bin I de la siguiente manera: para todos i = 1 ,..., log (Q) - 1, Pbins vol (i) es igual a la probabilidad, bajo PVOL, de que el volumen diario cae en el intervalo [Vmin 2i - 1, Vmin 2i) y PBins Vol (log (Q))para el último intervalo [VMAX /2, VMAX]. Definimos E como E (Pbins vol) ≡ Ei∼p Bins Vol 1/Pbins Vol (I) 2 =    log (Q) I = 1 Pbins Vol (I)   2. Dado que el soporte de PBINS VOL solo tiene elementos log (Q), E (PBINS VOL) puede variar de 1 (para distribuciones PVOL que colocan todo su peso en solo uno de los intervalos log (Q) entre Vmin, Vmin 2, Vmin, Vmin, VMin4, ..., Vmax) para registrar (Q) (para distribuciones PVOL en la que es probable que el volumen diario total caiga en cualquiera de estos intervalos). Tenga en cuenta que las distribuciones PVOL de este último tipo están lejos de ser uniformes en todo el rango [vmin, vmax]. Teorema 10. En el modelo de distribución de volumen bajo la suposición de variabilidad de volumen, existe un algoritmo en línea A para vender n acciones que, utilizando solo el conocimiento del PVOL de distribución de volumen total, logra RVWAP (A, PVOL) ≤ 2e (PBINS VOL). Todas las pruebas en esta sección se proporcionan en el apéndice. Como ejemplo concreto, considere el caso en el que PVOL es la distribución uniforme sobre [Vmin, VMAX]. En ese caso, Pbins Vol está aumentando exponencialmente y alcanza su punto máximo en el último contenedor, lo que, con el ancho más grande, también tiene el mayor peso. En este caso, E (Pbins Vol) es una constante (es decir, independiente de Q), que conduce a una relación competitiva constante. Por otro lado, si PVOL es exponencial, entonces PBINS VOL es uniforme, lo que lleva a una relación competitiva O (log (Q)), al igual que en la configuración de precio más adversario discutida anteriormente. En la Figura 3, proporcionamos límites específicos adicionales obtenidos para las distribuciones empíricas de volumen diario total calculado para algunas existencias reales. Ahora examinamos la configuración en la que se desconoce PVOL, pero hay una aproximación ˜ -VOL disponible. Definamos c (pbins vol, ˜pbins vol) = log (q) j = 1 ˜pbins vol (j) log (q) i = 1 p bins vol (i) √ ˜p bins vol (i). C se minimiza en C (Pbins Vol, Pbins Vol) = E (Pbins vol), y C puede ser infinito si ˜pbins vol (i) es 0 cuando Pbins Vol (i)> 0. Teorema 11. En el modelo de distribución de volumen bajo la suposición de variabilidad de volumen, existe un algoritmo en línea A para vender n acciones que usan solo el conocimiento de una aproximación de PVOL logra RVWAP (A, PVOL) ≤ 2C (PBINS VOL, ˜PBINS VOL). Como ejemplo de este resultado, suponga que nuestra aproximación obedece (1/α) pbins vol (i) ≤ ˜pbins vol (i) ≤ αpbins vol (i) para todos i, para algunos α> 1. Por lo tanto, nuestras probabilidades estimadas del índice de bin están dentro de un factor de α de la verdad. Entonces es fácil demostrar que C (Pbins Vol, ˜Pbins Vol) ≤ αE (PBINS VOL), por lo que según los teoremas 10 y 11 nuestra penalización por usar la distribución aproximada es un factor de α en la relación competitiva.5.

Considere el tiempo T donde el Anexo F fijo se vende menos, luego FT ≤ N/T. Considere las secuencias donde en el tiempo t tenemos pt = pMax, vt = v, y para los tiempos t = t tenemos pt = pmin y vt = 0. El VWAP es PMAX y el promedio de programación fija es (N/T) PMAX + (N - N/T) PMIN. Prueba.(Sketch of Theorem 4) El algoritmo simplemente vende UT = (VT/Vmin) n acciones en el momento t.El número total de acciones vendidas u es claramente más que n y u = t ut = t (vt/vmin) n = (v/vmin) n ≤ qn El precio promedio es v wApa (s) = (t ptut)/u= t pt (vt/v) = v wapm (s), donde utilizamos el hecho de que ut/u = vt/v.197 pruebas.(del teorema 5) Comenzamos con la prueba del límite inferior. Considere el siguiente escenario. Para las primeras unidades de tiempo T tenemos un precio de √ Rpmin y un volumen total de Vmin. Observamos cuántas acciones ha comprado el algoritmo en línea. Si ha comprado más de la mitad de las acciones, los pasos de tiempo restantes tienen precio PMIN y volumen vmax - vmin. De lo contrario, los pasos de tiempo restantes tienen precio PMAX y volumen insignificante. En el primer caso, el en línea ha pagado al menos √ rpmin /2, mientras que el VWAP es como máximo √ rpmin /q + pmin. Por lo tanto, en este caso la relación competitiva es Ω (Q). En el segundo caso, el en línea tiene que comprar al menos la mitad de las acciones en PMAX, por lo que su costo promedio es al menos PMAX /2. El mercado VWAP es √ rpmin = pMax / √ r, por lo tanto, la relación competitiva es Ω (√ r). Para el límite superior, podemos obtener una relación competitiva √ R, comprando todas las acciones una vez que el precio cae por debajo de √ rpmin. El límite superior Q se deriva ejecutando un algoritmo que supone que el volumen es Vmin. El en línea paga un costo de P, mientras que el VWAP será al menos P/Q.6.2 Pruebas de la Sección 4 Prueba.(Boceto del teorema 10) Usamos la idea de adivinar el volumen total del Teorema 1, pero ahora permitimos la posibilidad de una distribución arbitraria (pero conocida) sobre el volumen total. En particular, considere la construcción de una distribución GBins Vol sobre un conjunto de valores de volumen usando PVOL y úselo para adivinar el volumen total v. Deje que el algoritmo adivine ˆv = vmin 2i con probabilidad gbins vol (i). Luego tenga en cuenta que, para cualquier secuencia de precio-volumen, si v ∈ [vmin 2i-1, vmin 2i], vwapa (s) ≥ gbins vol (i) vwapm (s)/2. Esto implica un límite superior en RVWAP (A, PVOL) en términos de Gbins vol. Luego obtenemos que Gbins Vol (I) ∝ Pbins Vol (i) minimiza el límite superior, lo que conduce al límite superior establecido en el teorema. Prueba.(Sketch of Theorem 11) Reemplace PVOL con ˜PVOL en la expresión de GBINS VOL en el boceto de prueba para el último resultado.198",

        "INTRODUCTION While popular images of Wall Street often depict swashbuckling traders boldly making large gambles on just their market intuitions, the vast majority of trading is actually considerably more technical and constrained.",
        "The constraints often derive from a complex combination of business, regulatory and institutional issues, and result in certain kinds of standard trading strategies or criteria that invite algorithmic analysis.",
        "One of the most common activities in modern financial markets is known as Volume Weighted Average Price, or VWAP, trading.",
        "Informally, the VWAP of a stock over a specified market period is simply the average price paid per share during that period, so the price of each transaction in the market is weighted by its volume.",
        "In VWAP trading, one attempts to buy or sell a fixed number of shares at a price that closely tracks the VWAP.",
        "Very large institutional trades constitute one of the main motivations behind VWAP activity.",
        "A typical scenario goes as follows.",
        "Suppose a very large mutual fund holds 3% of the outstanding shares of a large, publicly traded company - a huge fraction of the shares - and that this funds manager decides he would like to reduce this holding to 2% over a 1-month period. (Such a decision might be forced by the funds own regulations or other considerations.)",
        "Typically, such a fund manager would be unqualified to sell such a large number of shares in the open market - it requires a professional broker to intelligently break the trade up over time, and possibly over multiple exchanges, in order to minimize the market impact of such a sizable transaction.",
        "Thus, the fund manager would approach brokerages for help in selling the 1%.",
        "The brokerage will typically alleviate the fund managers problem immediately by simply buying the shares directly from the fund manager, and then selling them off laterbut what price should the brokerage pay the fund manager?",
        "Paying the price on the day of the sale is too risky for the brokerage, as they need to sell the shares themselves over an extended period, and events beyond their control (such as wars) could cause the price to fall dramatically.",
        "The usual answer is that the brokerage offers to buy the shares from the fund manager at a per-share price tied to the VWAP over some future period - in our example, the brokerage might offer to buy the 1% at a per-share price of the coming months VWAP minus 1 cent.",
        "The brokerage now has a very clean challenge: by selling the shares themselves over the next month in a way that exactly matches the VWAP, a penny per share is earned in profits.",
        "If they can beat the VWAP by a penny, they make two cents per share.",
        "Such small-margin, high-volume profits can be extremely lucrative for a large brokerage.",
        "The importance of the VWAP has led to many automated VWAP trading algorithms - indeed, every major brokerage has at least one VWAP box, 189 Price Volume Model Order Book Model Macroscopic Distribution Model OWT Θ(log(R)) (From[3]) O(log(R) log(N)) 2E(Pbins maxprice ) 2(1 + )E(Pbins maxprice ) for -approx of Pbins maxprice Θ(log(Q)) (same as above plus...)

        "The rows represent results for either the OWT or VWAP criterion.",
        "The columns represent which model we are working in.",
        "The entry in the table is the competitive ratio between our algorithm and an optimal algorithm, and the closer the ratio is to 1 the better.",
        "The parameter R represents a bound on the maximum to the minimum price fluctuation and the parameter Q represents a bound on the maximum to minimum volume fluctuation in the respective model. (See Section 4 for a description of the Macroscopic Distribution Model.)",
        "All the results for the OWT trading criterion (which is a stronger criterion) directly translate to the VWAP criterion.",
        "However, in the VWAP setting, considering a restriction on the maximum to the minimum volume fluctuation Q, leads to an additional class of results which depends on Q. and some small companies focus exclusively on proprietary VWAP trading technology.",
        "In this paper, we provide the first study of VWAP trading algorithms in an online, competitive ratio setting.",
        "We first formalize the VWAP trading problem in a basic online model we call the price-volume model, which can be viewed as a generalization of previous theoretical online trading models incorporating market volume information.",
        "In this model, we provide VWAP algorithms and competitive ratios, and compare this setting with the one-way trading (OWT) problem studied in [3].",
        "Our most interesting results, however, examine the VWAP trading problem in a new online trading model capturing the important recent phenomenon of limit order books in financial markets.",
        "Briefly, a limit buy or sell order specifies both the number of shares and the desired price, and will only be executed if there is a matching party on the opposing side, according to a well-defined matching procedure used by all the major exchanges.",
        "While limit order books (the list of limit orders awaiting possible future execution) have existed since the dawn of equity exchanges, only very recently have these books become visible to traders in real time, thus opening the way to trading algorithms of all varieties that attempt to exploit this rich market microstructure data.",
        "Such data and algorithms are a topic of great current interest on Wall Street [4].",
        "We thus introduce a new online trading model incorporating limit order books, and examine both the one-way and VWAP trading problems in it.",
        "Our results are summarized in Figure 1 (see the caption for a summary). 2.",
        "THEPRICE-VOLUMETRADINGMODEL We now present a trading model which includes both price and volume information about the sequence of trades.",
        "While this model is a generalization of previous formalisms for online trading, it makes an infinite liquidity assumption which fails to model the negative market impact that trading a large number of shares typically has.",
        "This will be addressed in the order book model studied in the next section.",
        "A note on terminology: throughout the paper (unless otherwise specified), we shall use the term market to describe all activity or orders other than those of the algorithm under consideration.",
        "The setting we consider can be viewed as a game between our algorithm and the market. 2.1 The Model In the price-volume trading model, we assume that the intraday trading activity in a given stock is summarized by a discrete sequence of price and volume pairs (pt, vt) for t = 1, . . . , T. Here t = 0 corresponds to the days market open, and t = T to the close.",
        "While there is nothing technically special about the time horizon of a single day, it is particularly consistent with limit order book trading on Wall Street.",
        "The pair (pt, vt) represents the fact that a total of vt shares were traded at an (average) price per share pt in the market between time t − 1 and t. Realistically, we should imagine the number of intervals T being reasonably large, so that it is sensible to assign a common approximate price to all shares traded within an interval.",
        "In the price-volume model, we shall make an infinite liquidity assumption for our trading algorithms.",
        "More precisely, in this online model, we see the price-volume sequence one pair at a time.",
        "Following the observation of (pt, vt), we are permitted to sell any (possibly fractional) number of shares nt at the price pt.",
        "Let us assume that our goal is to sell N shares over the course of the day.",
        "Hence, at each time, we must select a (possibly fractional) number of shares nt to sell at price pt, subject to the global constraint T t=1 nt = N. It is thus assumed that if we have left over shares to sell after time T − 1, we are forced to sell them at the closing price of the market - that is, nT = N − T −1 t=1 nt is sold at pT .",
        "In this way we are certain to sell exactly N shares over the course of the day; the only thing an algorithm must do is determine the schedule of selling based on the incoming market price-volume stream.",
        "Any algorithm which sells fractional volumes can be converted to a randomized algorithm which only sells integral volumes with the same expected number of shares sold.",
        "If we keep the hard constraint of selling exactly N shares, we might incur an additional slight loss in the conversion. (Note that we only allow fractional volumes in the price-volume model, where liquidity is not an issue.",
        "In the order book model to follow, we do not allow fractional volumes.)",
        "In VWAP trading, the goal of an online algorithm A which sells exactly N shares is not to maximize profits per se, but to track the market VWAP.",
        "The market VWAP for an intraday trading sequence S = (p1, v1), . . . , (pT , vT ) is simply the average price paid per share over the course of the trading 190 day, ie VWAPM (S) = T t=1 ptvt /V where V is the total daily volume, i.e., V = T t=1 vt.",
        "If on the sequence S, the algorithm A sells its N stocks using the volume sequence n1, . . . nT , then we analogously define the VWAP of A on market sequence S by VWAPA(S) = T t=1 ptnt /N .",
        "Note that the market VWAP does not include the shares that the algorithm sells.",
        "The VWAP competitive ratio of A with respect to a set of sequences Σ is then RVWAP(A) = max S∈Σ {VWAPM (S)/VWAPA(S)} In the case that A is randomized, we generalize the definition above by taking an expectation over VWAPA(S) inside the max.",
        "We note that unlike on Wall Street, our definition of VWAPM does not take our own trading into account.",
        "It is easy to see that this makes it a more challenging criterion to track.",
        "In contrast to the VWAP, another common measure of the performance of an online selling algorithm would be its one-way trading (OWT) competitive ratio [3] with respect to a set of sequences Σ: ROWT(A) = max S∈Σ max 1≤t≤T {pt/VWAPA(S)} where the algorithms performance is compared to the largest individual price appearing in the sequence S. In both VWAP and OWT, we are comparing the average price per share received by a selling algorithm to some measure of market performance.",
        "In the case of OWT, we compare to the rather ambitious benchmark of the high price of the day, ignoring volumes entirely.",
        "In VWAP trading, we have the more modest goal of comparing favorably to the overall market average of the day.",
        "As we shall see, there are some important commonalities and differences to these two approaches.",
        "For now we note one simple fact: on any specific sequence S, VWAPA(S) may be larger that VWAPM (S).",
        "However, RVWAP(A) cannot be smaller than 1, since on any sequence S in which all price pt are identical, it is impossible to get a better average share per price.",
        "Thus, for all algorithms A, both RVWAP(A) and ROWT(A) are larger than 1, and the closer to 1 they are, the better A is tracking its respective performance measure. 2.2 VWAP Results in the Price-Volume Model As in previous work on online trading, it is generally not possible to obtain finite bounds on competitive ratios with absolutely no assumptions on the set of sequences Σbounds on the maximum variation in price or volume are required, depending on the exact setting.",
        "We thus introduce the following two assumptions. 2.2.0.1 Volume Variability Assumption.. Let 0 < Vmin ≤ Vmax be known positive constants, and define Q = Vmax /Vmin .",
        "For all intraday trading sequences S ∈ Σ, the total daily volume V ∈ [Vmin , Vmax ]. 2.2.0.2 Price Variability Assumption.. Let 0 < pmin ≤ pmax be known positive constants, and define R = pmax/pmin.",
        "For all intraday trading sequences S ∈ Σ, the prices satisfy pt ∈ [pmin, pmax], for all t = 1, . . . , T. Competitive ratios are generally taken over all sets Σ consistent with at least one of these assumptions.",
        "To gain some intuition consider the two trivial cases of R = 1 and Q = 1.",
        "In the case of R = 1 (where there is no fluctuation in price), any schedule is optimal.",
        "In the case of Q = 1 (where the total volume V over the trading period is known), we can gain a competitive ratio of 1 by selling vt V N shares after each time period.",
        "For the OWT problem in the price-volume model, volumes are irrelevant for the performance criterion, but for the VWAP criterion they are central.",
        "For the OWT problem under the price variability assumption, the results of [3] established that the optimal competitive ratio was Θ(log(R)).",
        "Our first result establishes that the optimal competitive ratio for VWAP under the volume variability assumption is Θ(log(Q)) and is achieved by an algorithm that ignores the price data.",
        "Theorem 1.",
        "In the price-volume model under the volume variability assumption, there exists an online algorithm A for selling N shares achieving competitive ratio RVWAP(A) ≤ 2 log(Q).",
        "In addition, if only the volume variability (and not the price variability) assumption holds, any online algorithm A for selling N shares has RVWAP(A) = Ω(log(Q)).",
        "Proof. (Sketch) For the upper bound, the idea is similar to the price reservation algorithm of [3] for the OWT problem, and similar in spirit to the general technique of classify and select [1].",
        "Consider algorithms which use a parameter ˆV , which is interpreted as an estimate for the total volume for the day.",
        "Then at each time t, if the market price and volume is (pt, vt), the algorithm sells a fraction vt/ ˆV of its shares.",
        "We consider a family of log(Q) such algorithms, where algorithm Ai uses ˆV = Vmin 2i−1 .",
        "Clearly, one of the Ai has a competitive ratio of 2.",
        "We can derive an O(log(Q)) VWAP competitive ratio by running these algorithms in parallel, and letting each algorithm sell N/ log(Q) shares. (Alternatively, we can randomly select one Ai and guarantee the same expected competitive ratio.)",
        "We now sketch the proof of the lower bound, which relates performance in the VWAP and OWT problems.",
        "Any algorithm that is c-competitive in the VWAP setting (under fixed Q) is 3c-competitive in the OWT setting with R = Q/2.",
        "To show this, we take any sequence S of prices for the OWT problem, and convert it into a price-volume sequence for the VWAP problem.",
        "The prices in the VWAP sequence are the same as in S. To construct the volumes in the VWAP sequence, we segment the prices in S into log(R) intervals [2i−1 pmin , 2i pmin ).",
        "Suppose pt ∈ [2i−1 pmin , 2i pmin ), and this is the first time in S that a price has fallen in this interval.",
        "Then in the VWAP sequence we set the volume vt = 2i−1 .",
        "If this is not the first visit to the interval containing pt, we set vt = 0.",
        "Assume that the maximum price in S is pmax .",
        "The VWAP of our sequence is at least pmax /3.",
        "Since we had a c competitive algorithm, its average sell is at least pmax /3c.",
        "The lower bound now follows using the lower bound in [3].",
        "An alternative approach to VWAP is to ignore the volumes in favor of prices, and apply an algorithm for the OWT problem.",
        "Note that the lower bound in this theorem, unlike in the previous one, only assumes a price variation bound. 191 Theorem 2.",
        "In the price-volume model under the price variability assumption, there exists an online algorithm A for selling N shares achieving competitive ratio RVWAP(A) = O(log(R)).",
        "In addition, if only the price variability (and not the volume variability) assumption holds, any online A for selling N shares has RVWAP(A) = Ω(log(R)).",
        "Proof. (Sketch) Follows immediately from the results of [3] for OWT: the upper bound from the simple fact that for any sequence S, VWAPA(S) is less than max1≤t≤T {pt}, and the lower bound from a reduction to OWT.",
        "Theorems 1 and 2 demonstrate that one can achieve logarithmic VWAP competitive ratios under the assumption of either bounded variability of total volume or bounded variability of maximum price.",
        "If both assumptions hold, it is possible to give an algorithm accomplishing the minimum of log(Q) and log(R).",
        "This flexibility of approach derives from the fact that the VWAP is a quantity in which both prices and volumes matter, as opposed to OWT. 2.3 RelatedResultsinthePrice-VolumeModel All of the VWAP algorithms we have discussed so far make some use of the daily data (pt, vt) as it unfolds, using either the price or volume information.",
        "In contrast, a fixed schedule VWAP algorithm has a predetermined distribution {f1, f2, . . . fT }, and simply sells ftN shares at time t, independent of (pt, vt).",
        "Fixed schedule VWAP algorithms, or slight variants of them, are surprisingly common on Wall Street, and the schedule is usually derived from historical intraday volume data.",
        "Our next result demonstrates that such algorithms can perform considerably worse than dynamically adaptive algorithms in terms of the worst case competitive ratio.",
        "Theorem 3.",
        "In the price-volume model under both the volume and price variability assumptions, any fixed schedule VWAP algorithm A for selling N shares has sell VWAP competitive ratio RVWAP(A) = Ω(min(T, R)).",
        "The proofs of all the results in this subsection are in the Appendix.",
        "So far our emphasis has been on VWAP algorithms that must sell exactly N shares.",
        "In many realistic circumstances, however, there is actually some flexibility in the precise number of shares to be sold.",
        "For instance, this is true at large brokerages, where many separate VWAP trades may be pooled and executed by a common algorithm, and the firm would be quite willing to carry a small position of unsold shares overnight if it resulted in better execution prices.",
        "The following theorem (which interestingly has no analogue for the OWT problem) demonstrates that this trade-off in shares sold and performance can be realized dramatically in our model.",
        "It states that if we are willing to let the number of shares sold vary with Q, we can in fact achieve a VWAP competitive ratio of 1.",
        "Theorem 4.",
        "In the price-volume model under the volume variability assumption, there exists an algorithm A that always sells between N and QN shares and that the average price per sold share is exactly VWAPM (S).",
        "In many online problems, there is a clear distinction between benefit problems and cost problems [2].",
        "In the VWAP setting, selling shares is a benefit problem, and buying shares is a cost problem.",
        "The definitions of the competitive ratios, Rbuy VWAP(A) and Rbuy OWT(A), for algorithms which Figure 2: Sample Island order books for MSFT. buy exactly N shares are maxS∈Σ{VWAPA(S)/VWAPM (S)} and maxS∈Σ maxt{VWAPA(S)/pt} respectively.",

        "Suppose we wish to purchase 1000 shares of Microsoft (MSFT) stock.",
        "In a limit order, we specify not only the desired volume (1000 shares), but also the desired price.",
        "Suppose that MSFT is currently trading at roughly $24.07 a share (see Figure 2, which shows an actual snapshot of a recent MSFT order book on Island (www.island.com), a well-known electronic exchange for NASDAQ stocks), but we are only willing to buy the 1000 shares at $24.04 a share or lower.",
        "We can choose to submit a limit order with this specification, and our order will be placed in a queue called the buy order book, which is ordered by price, with the highest offered unexecuted buy price at the top (often referred to as the bid).",
        "If there are multiple limit orders at the same price, they are ordered by time of arrival (with older orders higher in the book).",
        "In the example provided by Figure 2, our order would be placed immediately after the extant order for 5,503 shares at $24.04; though we offer the same price, this order has arrived before ours.",
        "Similarly, a sell order book for sell limit orders (for instance, we might want to sell 500 shares of MSFT at $24.10 or higher) is maintained, this time with the lowest sell price offered (often referred to as the ask).",
        "Thus, the order books are sorted from the most competitive limit orders at the top (high buy prices and low sell prices) down to less competitive limit orders.",
        "The bid and ask prices (which again, are simply the prices in the limit orders at the top of the buy and sell books, respectively) together are sometimes referred to as the inside market, and the difference between them as the spread.",
        "By definition, the order books always consist exclusively of unexecuted orders - they are queues of orders hopefully waiting for the price to move in their direction.",
        "How then do orders get executed?",
        "There are two methods.",
        "First, any time a market order arrives, it is immediately matched with the most competitive limit orders on the opposing book.",
        "Thus, a market order to buy 2000 shares is matched with enough volume on the sell order book to fill the 2000 shares.",
        "For instance, in the example of Figure 2, such an order would be filled by the two limit sell orders for 500 shares at $24.069, the 500 shares at $24.07, the 200 shares at $24.08, and then 300 of the 1981 shares at $24.09.",
        "The remaining 1681 shares of this last limit order would remain as the new top of the sell limit order book.",
        "Second, if a buy (sell, respectively) limit order comes in above the ask (below the bid, respectively) price, then the order is matched with orders on the opposing books.",
        "It is important to note that the prices of executions are the prices specified in the limit orders already in the books, not the prices of the incoming order that is immediately executed.",
        "Every market or limit order arrives atomically and instantaneously - there is a strict temporal sequence in which orders arrive, and two orders can never arrive simultaneously.",
        "This gives rise to the definition of the last price of the exchange, which is simply the last price at which the exchange executed an order.",
        "It is this quantity that is usually meant when people casually refer to the (ticker) price of a stock.",
        "Note that a limit buy (sell, respectively) order with a price of infinity (0, respectively) is effectively a market order.",
        "We shall thus assume without loss of generality that all orders are placed as limit order.",
        "Although limit orders which are unexecuted may be removed by the party which placed them, for simplicity, we assume that limit orders are never removed from the books.",
        "We refer the reader to [4] for further discussion of modern electronic exchanges and market microstructure. 3.2 The Model The online order book trading model is intended to capture the realistic details of market microstructure just discussed in a competitive ratio setting.",
        "In this refined model, a days market activity is described by a sequence of limit orders (pt, vt, bt).",
        "Here bt is a bit indicating whether the order is a buy or sell order, while pt is the limit order price and vt the number of shares desired.",
        "Following the arrival of each such limit order, an online trading algorithm is permitted to place its own limit order.",
        "These two interleaved sources (market and algorithm) of limit orders are then simply operated on according to the matching process described in Section 3.1.",
        "Any limit order that is not immediately executable according to this process is placed in the appropriate (buy or sell) book for possible future execution; arriving orders that can be partially or fully executed are so executed, with any residual shares remaining on the respective book.",
        "The goal of a VWAP or OWT selling algorithm is essentially the same as in the price-volume model, but the context has changed in the following two fundamental ways.",
        "First, the assumption of infinite liquidity in the price-volume model is eliminated entirely.",
        "The number of shares available at any given price is restricted to the total volume of limit orders offering that price.",
        "Second, all incoming orders, and therefore the complete limit order books, are assumed to be visible to the algorithm.",
        "This is consistent with modern electronic financial exchanges, and indeed is the source of much current interest on Wall Street [4].",
        "In general, the definition of competitive ratios in the order book model is complicated by the fact that now our algorithms activity influences the sequence of executed prices and volumes.",
        "We thus first define the execution sequence determined by a limit order sequence (placed by the market and our algorithm).",
        "Let S = (p1, v1, b1), . . . , (pT , vT , bT ) be a limit order sequence placed by the market, and let S = (p1, v1, b1), . . . , (pT , vT , bT ) be a limit order sequence placed by our algorithm (unless otherwise specified, all bt are of the sell type).",
        "Let merge(S, S ) be the merged sequence (p1, v1, b1), (p1, v1, b1), . . . , (pT , vT , bT ), (pT , vT , bT ), which is the time sequence of orders placed by the market and algorithm.",

        "Proof.",
        "The algorithm A works by guessing a price p in the set {pmin2i : 1 ≤ i ≤ log(R)} and placing a sell limit order for all N shares at the price p at the beginning of the day. (Alternatively, algorithm A can place log(R) sell limit orders, where the i-th one has price 2i pmin and volume N/ log(R).)",
        "By placing an order at the beginning of the day, the algorithm undercuts all sell orders that will be placed during the day for a price of p or higher, meaning the algorithms N shares must be filled first at this price.",
        "Hence, if there were k shares that would have been sold at price p or higher without our activity, then A would sell at least kp shares.",
        "We define {pj} to be the multiset of prices of individual shares that are either executed or are buy limit order shares that remained unexecuted, excluding the activity of our algorithm (that is, assuming our algorithm places no orders).",

        "Consider guessing the kth highest such price, pk.",
        "If an order for N shares is placed at the days start at price pk, then we are guaranteed to obtain a return of kpk.",
        "Let k∗ = argmaxk{kpk}.",
        "We can view our algorithm as attempting to guess pk∗ , and succeeding if the guess p satisfies p ∈ [pk∗ /2, pk∗ ].",
        "Hence, we are 2 log(R) competitive with the quantity max1≤k≤N kpk.",
        "Note that ρ ≡ N i=1 pi = N i=1 1 i ipi ≤ max 1≤k≤N kpk N i=1 1 i ≤ log(N) max 1≤k≤N kpk where ρ is defined as the sum of the top N prices pi without As involvement.",
        "Similarly, let {pj} be the multiset of prices of individual executed shares, or the prices of unexecuted buy order shares, but now including the orders placed by some selling algorithm A .",
        "We now wish to show that for all algorithms A which sell N shares, REVA ≤ N i=1 pi ≤ ρ.",
        "Essentially, this inequality states the intuitive idea that a selling algorithm can only lower executed or unmatched buy order share prices.",
        "To prove this, we use induction to show that the removal of the activity of a selling algorithm causes these prices to increase.",
        "First, remove the last share in the last sell order placed by either A or the market on an arbitrary sequence merge(S, S ) - by this we mean, take the last sell order placed by A or the market and decrease its volume by one share.",
        "After this modification, the top N prices p1 . . . pN will not decrease.",
        "This is because either this sell order share was not executed, in which case the claim is trivially true, or, if it was executed, the removal of this sell order share leaves an additional unexecuted buy order share of equal or higher price.",
        "For induction, assume that if we remove a share from any sell order that was placed, by A or the market, at or after time t then the top N prices do not decrease.",

        "If this sell order share was not executed, then the claim is trivially true.",
        "Else, if the sell order share was executed, then claim is true because by removing this executed share from the sell order either: i) the corresponding buy order share (of equal or higher value) is unmatched on the remainder of the sequence, in which case the claim is true; or ii) this buy 194 order matches some sell order share at an equal or higher price, which has the effect of removing a share from a sell order on the remainder of the sequence, and, by the inductive assumption, this can only increase prices.",

        "The set of sequences Σ satisfies the following two properties.",
        "First, we assume that each order placed by the market is of volume less than γ, which we view as a mild assumption since typically single orders on the market are not of high volume (due to liquidity issues).",
        "This assumption allows our algorithm to place at least one limit order at a time interleaved with approximately γ market executions.",
        "Second, we assume that there is large volume in the sell order books below the price pmax , which means that no orders placed by the market will be executed above the price pmax .",
        "The simplest way to instantiate this latter assumption in the order book model is to assume that each sequence S ∈ Σ starts by placing a huge number of sell orders (more than Vmax ) at price pmax .",
        "Although this assumption has a maximum price parameter, it does not imply that the price ratio R is finite, since it does not imply any lower bound on the prices of buy or executed shares (aside from the trivial one of 0).",

        "Consider the order book model under the bounded order volume and max price assumption.",

        "The algorithm divides the trading day into volume intervals whose real-time duration may vary.",
        "For each period i in which γ shares have been executed in the market, the algorithm computes the market VWAP of only those shares traded in period i; let us denote this by VWAPi.",

        "More precisely, the algorithm only places orders at the discrete prices (1− )pmax , (1− )2 pmax , . . ..",
        "Following volume interval i, the algorithm places a limit order to sell one share at the discretized price that is closest to VWAPi, but which is strictly smaller.",
        "For the analysis, we begin by noting that if all of the algorithms limit orders are executed during the day, the total revenue received by the algorithm would be at least (1 − )VWAPM (S, S )N. To see this, it suffices to note that VWAPM (S, S ) is a uniform mixture of the VWAPi (since by definition they each cover the same amount of market volume); and if all the algorithms limit orders were executed, they each received more than (1 − )VWAPi dollars for the interval i they followed.",
        "We now count the potential lost revenue of the algorithm due to unexecuted limit orders.",
        "By the assumption that individual orders are placed with volume less than γ, then our algorithm is able to place a limit order during every block of γ shares have been traded.",
        "Hence, after γN market orders have been executed, A has placed N orders in the market.",
        "Note that there can be at most one limit order (and thus, at most one share) left unexecuted at each level of the discretized price ladder defined above.",
        "This is because following interval i, the algorithm places its limit order strictly below VWAPi, so if VWAPj ≥ VWAPi for j > i, this limit order must have been executed.",
        "Thus unexecuted limit orders bound the VWAPs of the remainder of the day, resulting in at most one unexecuted order per price level.",

                "Informally, the VWAP of a stock over a specified market period is simply the average price paid per share during that period, so the price of each transaction in the market is weighted by its volume.",

(Such a decision might be forced by the funds own regulations or other considerations.)",
                "Typically, such a fund manager would be unqualified to sell such a large number of shares in the open market - it requires a professional broker to intelligently break the trade up over time, and possibly over multiple exchanges, in order to minimize the market impact of such a sizable transaction.",

                "The usual answer is that the brokerage offers to buy the shares from the fund manager at a per-share price tied to the VWAP over some future period - in our example, the brokerage might offer to buy the 1% at a per-share price of the coming months VWAP minus 1 cent.",
                "The brokerage now has a very clean challenge: by selling the shares themselves over the next month in a way that exactly matches the VWAP, a penny per share is earned in profits.",

Here t = 0 corresponds to the days market open, and t = T to the close.",
                "While there is nothing technically special about the time horizon of a single day, it is particularly consistent with limit order book trading on Wall Street.",
                "The pair (pt, vt) represents the fact that a total of vt shares were traded at an (average) price per share pt in the market between time t − 1 and t. Realistically, we should imagine the number of intervals T being reasonably large, so that it is sensible to assign a common approximate price to all shares traded within an interval.",
                "In the price-volume model, we shall make an infinite liquidity assumption for our trading algorithms.",
                "More precisely, in this <br>online model</br>, we see the price-volume sequence one pair at a time.",
                "Following the observation of (pt, vt), we are permitted to sell any (possibly fractional) number of shares nt at the price pt.",
                "Let us assume that our goal is to sell N shares over the course of the day.",
                "Hence, at each time, we must select a (possibly fractional) number of shares nt to sell at price pt, subject to the global constraint T t=1 nt = N. It is thus assumed that if we have left over shares to sell after time T − 1, we are forced to sell them at the closing price of the market - that is, nT = N − T −1 t=1 nt is sold at pT .",
                "In this way we are certain to sell exactly N shares over the course of the day; the only thing an algorithm must do is determine the schedule of selling based on the incoming market price-volume stream.",
                "Any algorithm which sells fractional volumes can be converted to a randomized algorithm which only sells integral volumes with the same expected number of shares sold.",
                "If we keep the hard constraint of selling exactly N shares, we might incur an additional slight loss in the conversion. (Note that we only allow fractional volumes in the price-volume model, where liquidity is not an issue.",
                "In the order book model to follow, we do not allow fractional volumes.)",
                "In VWAP trading, the goal of an online algorithm A which sells exactly N shares is not to maximize profits per se, but to track the market VWAP.",
                "The market VWAP for an intraday trading sequence S = (p1, v1), . . . , (pT , vT ) is simply the average price paid per share over the course of the trading 190 day, ie VWAPM (S) = T t=1 ptvt /V where V is the total daily volume, i.e., V = T t=1 vt.",
                "If on the sequence S, the algorithm A sells its N stocks using the volume sequence n1, . . . nT , then we analogously define the VWAP of A on market sequence S by VWAPA(S) = T t=1 ptnt /N .",

                "We note that unlike on Wall Street, our definition of VWAPM does not take our own trading into account.",
                "It is easy to see that this makes it a more challenging criterion to track.",
                "In contrast to the VWAP, another common measure of the performance of an online selling algorithm would be its one-way trading (OWT) competitive ratio [3] with respect to a set of sequences Σ: ROWT(A) = max S∈Σ max 1≤t≤T {pt/VWAPA(S)} where the algorithms performance is compared to the largest individual price appearing in the sequence S. In both VWAP and OWT, we are comparing the average price per share received by a selling algorithm to some measure of market performance.",
                "In the case of OWT, we compare to the rather ambitious benchmark of the high price of the day, ignoring volumes entirely.",
                "In VWAP trading, we have the more modest goal of comparing favorably to the overall market average of the day.",
                "As we shall see, there are some important commonalities and differences to these two approaches.",
                "For now we note one simple fact: on any specific sequence S, VWAPA(S) may be larger that VWAPM (S).",
                "However, RVWAP(A) cannot be smaller than 1, since on any sequence S in which all price pt are identical, it is impossible to get a better average share per price.",
                "Thus, for all algorithms A, both RVWAP(A) and ROWT(A) are larger than 1, and the closer to 1 they are, the better A is tracking its respective performance measure. 2.2 VWAP Results in the Price-Volume Model As in previous work on online trading, it is generally not possible to obtain finite bounds on competitive ratios with absolutely no assumptions on the set of sequences Σbounds on the maximum variation in price or volume are required, depending on the exact setting.",
                "We thus introduce the following two assumptions. 2.2.0.1 Volume Variability Assumption.. Let 0 < Vmin ≤ Vmax be known positive constants, and define Q = Vmax /Vmin .",

                "For all intraday trading sequences S ∈ Σ, the prices satisfy pt ∈ [pmin, pmax], for all t = 1, . . . , T. Competitive ratios are generally taken over all sets Σ consistent with at least one of these assumptions.",
                "To gain some intuition consider the two trivial cases of R = 1 and Q = 1.",
                "In the case of R = 1 (where there is no fluctuation in price), any schedule is optimal.",
                "In the case of Q = 1 (where the total volume V over the trading period is known), we can gain a competitive ratio of 1 by selling vt V N shares after each time period.",
                "For the OWT problem in the price-volume model, volumes are irrelevant for the performance criterion, but for the VWAP criterion they are central.",
                "For the OWT problem under the price variability assumption, the results of [3] established that the optimal competitive ratio was Θ(log(R)).",
                "Our first result establishes that the optimal competitive ratio for VWAP under the volume variability assumption is Θ(log(Q)) and is achieved by an algorithm that ignores the price data.",

                "In addition, if only the volume variability (and not the price variability) assumption holds, any online algorithm A for selling N shares has RVWAP(A) = Ω(log(Q)).",
                "Proof. (Sketch) For the upper bound, the idea is similar to the price reservation algorithm of [3] for the OWT problem, and similar in spirit to the general technique of classify and select [1].",

                "Any algorithm that is c-competitive in the VWAP setting (under fixed Q) is 3c-competitive in the OWT setting with R = Q/2.",

                "The prices in the VWAP sequence are the same as in S. To construct the volumes in the VWAP sequence, we segment the prices in S into log(R) intervals [2i−1 pmin , 2i pmin ).",

                "This flexibility of approach derives from the fact that the VWAP is a quantity in which both prices and volumes matter, as opposed to OWT. 2.3 RelatedResultsinthePrice-VolumeModel All of the VWAP algorithms we have discussed so far make some use of the daily data (pt, vt) as it unfolds, using either the price or volume information.",

Here t = 0 corresponds to the days market open, and t = T to the close.",

                "Let us assume that our goal is to sell N shares over the course of the day.",
                "Hence, at each time, we must select a (possibly fractional) number of shares nt to sell at price pt, subject to the global constraint T t=1 nt = N. It is thus assumed that if we have left over shares to sell after time T − 1, we are forced to sell them at the closing price of the market - that is, nT = N − T −1 t=1 nt is sold at pT .",

                "In VWAP trading, the goal of an online algorithm A which sells exactly N shares is not to maximize profits per se, but to track the market VWAP.",

                "We note that unlike on Wall Street, our definition of VWAPM does not take our own trading into account.",
                "It is easy to see that this makes it a more challenging criterion to track.",
                "In contrast to the VWAP, another common measure of the performance of an online selling algorithm would be its one-way trading (OWT) competitive ratio [3] with respect to a set of sequences Σ: ROWT(A) = max S∈Σ max 1≤t≤T {pt/VWAPA(S)} where the algorithms performance is compared to the largest individual price appearing in the sequence S. In both VWAP and OWT, we are comparing the average price per share received by a selling algorithm to some measure of market performance.",

                "However, RVWAP(A) cannot be smaller than 1, since on any sequence S in which all price pt are identical, it is impossible to get a better average share per price.",
                "Thus, for all algorithms A, both RVWAP(A) and ROWT(A) are larger than 1, and the closer to 1 they are, the better A is tracking its respective performance measure. 2.2 VWAP Results in the Price-Volume Model As in previous work on online trading, it is generally not possible to obtain finite bounds on competitive ratios with absolutely no assumptions on the set of sequences Σbounds on the maximum variation in price or volume are required, depending on the exact setting.",
                "We thus introduce the following two assumptions. 2.2.0.1 Volume Variability Assumption.. Let 0 < Vmin ≤ Vmax be known positive constants, and define Q = Vmax /Vmin .",

                "Paying the price on the day of the sale is too risky for the brokerage, as they need to sell the shares themselves over an extended period, and events beyond their control (such as wars) could cause the price to fall dramatically.",
                "The usual answer is that the brokerage offers to buy the shares from the fund manager at a per-share price tied to the VWAP over some future period - in our example, the brokerage might offer to buy the 1% at a per-share price of the coming months VWAP minus 1 cent.",

                "INTRODUCTION While popular images of Wall Street often depict swashbuckling traders boldly making large gambles on just their market intuitions, the vast majority of trading is actually considerably more technical and constrained.",
                "The constraints often derive from a complex combination of business, regulatory and institutional issues, and result in certain kinds of standard trading strategies or criteria that invite algorithmic analysis.",
                "One of the most common activities in modern financial markets is known as Volume Weighted Average Price, or VWAP, trading.",
                "Informally, the VWAP of a stock over a specified market period is simply the average price paid per share during that period, so the price of each transaction in the market is weighted by its volume.",
                "In VWAP trading, one attempts to buy or sell a fixed number of shares at a price that closely tracks the VWAP.",
                "Very large institutional trades constitute one of the main motivations behind VWAP activity.",
                "A typical scenario goes as follows.",
                "Suppose a very large mutual fund holds 3% of the outstanding shares of a large, publicly traded company - a huge fraction of the shares - and that this funds manager decides he would like to reduce this holding to 2% over a 1-month period. (Such a decision might be forced by the funds own regulations or other considerations.)",
                "Typically, such a fund manager would be unqualified to sell such a large number of shares in the open market - it requires a professional broker to intelligently break the trade up over time, and possibly over multiple exchanges, in order to minimize the market impact of such a sizable transaction.",
                "Thus, the fund manager would approach brokerages for help in selling the 1%.",
                "The brokerage will typically alleviate the fund managers problem immediately by simply buying the shares directly from the fund manager, and then selling them off laterbut what price should the brokerage pay the fund manager?",
                "Paying the price on the day of the sale is too risky for the brokerage, as they need to sell the shares themselves over an extended period, and events beyond their control (such as wars) could cause the price to fall dramatically.",
                "The usual answer is that the brokerage offers to buy the shares from the fund manager at a per-share price tied to the VWAP over some future period - in our example, the brokerage might offer to buy the 1% at a per-share price of the coming months VWAP minus 1 cent.",
                "The brokerage now has a very clean challenge: by selling the shares themselves over the next month in a way that exactly matches the VWAP, a penny per share is earned in profits.",
                "If they can beat the VWAP by a penny, they make two cents per share.",
                "Such small-margin, high-volume profits can be extremely lucrative for a large brokerage.",
                "The importance of the VWAP has led to many automated VWAP trading algorithms - indeed, every major brokerage has at least one VWAP box, 189 Price Volume Model Order Book Model Macroscopic Distribution Model OWT Θ(log(R)) (From[3]) O(log(R) log(N)) 2E(Pbins maxprice ) 2(1 + )E(Pbins maxprice ) for -approx of Pbins maxprice Θ(log(Q)) (same as above plus...)

                "The rows represent results for either the OWT or VWAP criterion.",
                "The columns represent which model we are working in.",
                "The entry in the table is the competitive ratio between our algorithm and an optimal algorithm, and the closer the ratio is to 1 the better.",
                "The parameter R represents a bound on the maximum to the minimum price fluctuation and the parameter Q represents a bound on the maximum to minimum volume fluctuation in the respective model. (See Section 4 for a description of the Macroscopic Distribution Model.)",
                "All the results for the OWT trading criterion (which is a stronger criterion) directly translate to the VWAP criterion.",
                "However, in the VWAP setting, considering a restriction on the maximum to the minimum volume fluctuation Q, leads to an additional class of results which depends on Q. and some small companies focus exclusively on proprietary VWAP trading technology.",
                "In this paper, we provide the first study of VWAP trading algorithms in an online, competitive ratio setting.",
                "We first formalize the VWAP trading problem in a basic online model we call the price-volume model, which can be viewed as a generalization of previous theoretical online trading models incorporating market volume information.",
                "In this model, we provide VWAP algorithms and competitive ratios, and compare this setting with the one-way trading (OWT) problem studied in [3].",
                "Our most interesting results, however, examine the VWAP trading problem in a new online trading model capturing the important recent phenomenon of limit order books in financial markets.",
                "Briefly, a limit buy or sell order specifies both the number of shares and the desired price, and will only be executed if there is a matching party on the opposing side, according to a well-defined matching procedure used by all the major exchanges.",
                "While limit order books (the list of limit orders awaiting possible future execution) have existed since the dawn of equity exchanges, only very recently have these books become visible to traders in real time, thus opening the way to trading algorithms of all varieties that attempt to exploit this rich market microstructure data.",
                "Such data and algorithms are a topic of great current interest on Wall Street [4].",
                "We thus introduce a new online trading model incorporating limit order books, and examine both the one-way and VWAP trading problems in it.",
                "Our results are summarized in Figure 1 (see the caption for a summary). 2.",
                "THEPRICE-VOLUMETRADINGMODEL We now present a trading model which includes both price and volume information about the sequence of trades.",
                "While this model is a generalization of previous formalisms for online trading, it makes an infinite liquidity assumption which fails to model the negative market impact that trading a large number of shares typically has.",
                "This will be addressed in the order book model studied in the next section.",
                "A note on terminology: throughout the paper (unless otherwise specified), we shall use the term market to describe all activity or orders other than those of the algorithm under consideration.",
                "The setting we consider can be viewed as a game between our algorithm and the market. 2.1 The Model In the price-volume trading model, we assume that the intraday trading activity in a given stock is summarized by a discrete sequence of price and volume pairs (pt, vt) for t = 1, . . . , T. Here t = 0 corresponds to the days market open, and t = T to the close.",
                "While there is nothing technically special about the time horizon of a single day, it is particularly consistent with limit order book trading on Wall Street.",
                "The pair (pt, vt) represents the fact that a total of vt shares were traded at an (average) price per share pt in the market between time t − 1 and t. Realistically, we should imagine the number of intervals T being reasonably large, so that it is sensible to assign a common approximate price to all shares traded within an interval.",
                "In the price-volume model, we shall make an infinite liquidity assumption for our trading algorithms.",
                "More precisely, in this online model, we see the price-volume sequence one pair at a time.",
                "Following the observation of (pt, vt), we are permitted to sell any (possibly fractional) number of shares nt at the price pt.",
                "Let us assume that our goal is to sell N shares over the course of the day.",
                "Hence, at each time, we must select a (possibly fractional) number of shares nt to sell at price pt, subject to the global constraint T t=1 nt = N. It is thus assumed that if we have left over shares to sell after time T − 1, we are forced to sell them at the closing price of the market - that is, nT = N − T −1 t=1 nt is sold at pT .",
                "In this way we are certain to sell exactly N shares over the course of the day; the only thing an algorithm must do is determine the schedule of selling based on the incoming market price-volume stream.",
                "Any algorithm which sells fractional volumes can be converted to a randomized algorithm which only sells integral volumes with the same expected number of shares sold.",
                "If we keep the hard constraint of selling exactly N shares, we might incur an additional slight loss in the conversion. (Note that we only allow fractional volumes in the price-volume model, where liquidity is not an issue.",
                "In the order book model to follow, we do not allow fractional volumes.)",
                "In VWAP trading, the goal of an online algorithm A which sells exactly N shares is not to maximize profits per se, but to track the market VWAP.",
                "The market VWAP for an intraday trading sequence S = (p1, v1), . . . , (pT , vT ) is simply the average price paid per share over the course of the trading 190 day, ie VWAPM (S) = T t=1 ptvt /V where V is the total daily volume, i.e., V = T t=1 vt.",
                "If on the sequence S, the algorithm A sells its N stocks using the volume sequence n1, . . . nT , then we analogously define the VWAP of A on market sequence S by VWAPA(S) = T t=1 ptnt /N .",
                "Note that the market VWAP does not include the shares that the algorithm sells.",
                "The VWAP competitive ratio of A with respect to a set of sequences Σ is then RVWAP(A) = max S∈Σ {VWAPM (S)/VWAPA(S)} In the case that A is randomized, we generalize the definition above by taking an expectation over VWAPA(S) inside the max.",
                "We note that unlike on Wall Street, our definition of VWAPM does not take our own trading into account.",
                "It is easy to see that this makes it a more challenging criterion to track.",
                "In contrast to the VWAP, another common measure of the performance of an online selling algorithm would be its one-way trading (OWT) competitive ratio [3] with respect to a set of sequences Σ: ROWT(A) = max S∈Σ max 1≤t≤T {pt/VWAPA(S)} where the algorithms performance is compared to the largest individual price appearing in the sequence S. In both VWAP and OWT, we are comparing the average price per share received by a selling algorithm to some measure of market performance.",
                "In the case of OWT, we compare to the rather ambitious benchmark of the high price of the day, ignoring volumes entirely.",
                "In VWAP trading, we have the more modest goal of comparing favorably to the overall market average of the day.",
                "As we shall see, there are some important commonalities and differences to these two approaches.",
                "For now we note one simple fact: on any specific sequence S, VWAPA(S) may be larger that VWAPM (S).",
                "However, RVWAP(A) cannot be smaller than 1, since on any sequence S in which all price pt are identical, it is impossible to get a better average share per price.",
                "Thus, for all algorithms A, both RVWAP(A) and ROWT(A) are larger than 1, and the closer to 1 they are, the better A is tracking its respective performance measure. 2.2 VWAP Results in the Price-Volume Model As in previous work on online trading, it is generally not possible to obtain finite bounds on competitive ratios with absolutely no assumptions on the set of sequences Σbounds on the maximum variation in price or volume are required, depending on the exact setting.",
                "We thus introduce the following two assumptions. 2.2.0.1 Volume Variability Assumption.. Let 0 < Vmin ≤ Vmax be known positive constants, and define Q = Vmax /Vmin .",
                "For all intraday trading sequences S ∈ Σ, the total daily volume V ∈ [Vmin , Vmax ]. 2.2.0.2 Price Variability Assumption.. Let 0 < pmin ≤ pmax be known positive constants, and define R = pmax/pmin.",
                "For all intraday trading sequences S ∈ Σ, the prices satisfy pt ∈ [pmin, pmax], for all t = 1, . . . , T. Competitive ratios are generally taken over all sets Σ consistent with at least one of these assumptions.",
                "To gain some intuition consider the two trivial cases of R = 1 and Q = 1.",
                "In the case of R = 1 (where there is no fluctuation in price), any schedule is optimal.",
                "In the case of Q = 1 (where the total volume V over the trading period is known), we can gain a competitive ratio of 1 by selling vt V N shares after each time period.",
                "For the OWT problem in the price-volume model, volumes are irrelevant for the performance criterion, but for the VWAP criterion they are central.",
                "For the OWT problem under the price variability assumption, the results of [3] established that the optimal competitive ratio was Θ(log(R)).",
                "Our first result establishes that the optimal competitive ratio for VWAP under the volume variability assumption is Θ(log(Q)) and is achieved by an algorithm that ignores the price data.",
                "Theorem 1.",
                "In the price-volume model under the volume variability assumption, there exists an online algorithm A for selling N shares achieving competitive ratio RVWAP(A) ≤ 2 log(Q).",
                "In addition, if only the volume variability (and not the price variability) assumption holds, any online algorithm A for selling N shares has RVWAP(A) = Ω(log(Q)).",
                "Proof. (Sketch) For the upper bound, the idea is similar to the price reservation algorithm of [3] for the OWT problem, and similar in spirit to the general technique of classify and select [1].",
                "Consider algorithms which use a parameter ˆV , which is interpreted as an estimate for the total volume for the day.",
                "Then at each time t, if the market price and volume is (pt, vt), the algorithm sells a fraction vt/ ˆV of its shares.",
                "We consider a family of log(Q) such algorithms, where algorithm Ai uses ˆV = Vmin 2i−1 .",
                "Clearly, one of the Ai has a competitive ratio of 2.",
                "We can derive an O(log(Q)) VWAP competitive ratio by running these algorithms in parallel, and letting each algorithm sell N/ log(Q) shares. (Alternatively, we can randomly select one Ai and guarantee the same expected competitive ratio.)",
                "We now sketch the proof of the lower bound, which relates performance in the VWAP and OWT problems.",
                "Any algorithm that is c-competitive in the VWAP setting (under fixed Q) is 3c-competitive in the OWT setting with R = Q/2.",
                "To show this, we take any sequence S of prices for the OWT problem, and convert it into a price-volume sequence for the VWAP problem.",
                "The prices in the VWAP sequence are the same as in S. To construct the volumes in the VWAP sequence, we segment the prices in S into log(R) intervals [2i−1 pmin , 2i pmin ).",
                "Suppose pt ∈ [2i−1 pmin , 2i pmin ), and this is the first time in S that a price has fallen in this interval.",
                "Then in the VWAP sequence we set the volume vt = 2i−1 .",
                "If this is not the first visit to the interval containing pt, we set vt = 0.",
                "Assume that the maximum price in S is pmax .",
                "The VWAP of our sequence is at least pmax /3.",
                "Since we had a c competitive algorithm, its average sell is at least pmax /3c.",
                "The lower bound now follows using the lower bound in [3].",
                "An alternative approach to VWAP is to ignore the volumes in favor of prices, and apply an algorithm for the OWT problem.",
                "Note that the lower bound in this theorem, unlike in the previous one, only assumes a price variation bound. 191 Theorem 2.",
                "In the price-volume model under the price variability assumption, there exists an online algorithm A for selling N shares achieving competitive ratio RVWAP(A) = O(log(R)).",
                "In addition, if only the price variability (and not the volume variability) assumption holds, any online A for selling N shares has RVWAP(A) = Ω(log(R)).",
                "Proof. (Sketch) Follows immediately from the results of [3] for OWT: the upper bound from the simple fact that for any sequence S, VWAPA(S) is less than max1≤t≤T {pt}, and the lower bound from a reduction to OWT.",
                "Theorems 1 and 2 demonstrate that one can achieve logarithmic VWAP competitive ratios under the assumption of either bounded variability of total volume or bounded variability of maximum price.",
                "If both assumptions hold, it is possible to give an algorithm accomplishing the minimum of log(Q) and log(R).",
                "This flexibility of approach derives from the fact that the VWAP is a quantity in which both prices and volumes matter, as opposed to OWT. 2.3 RelatedResultsinthePrice-VolumeModel All of the VWAP algorithms we have discussed so far make some use of the daily data (pt, vt) as it unfolds, using either the price or volume information.",
                "In contrast, a fixed schedule VWAP algorithm has a predetermined distribution {f1, f2, . . . fT }, and simply sells ftN shares at time t, independent of (pt, vt).",
                "Fixed schedule VWAP algorithms, or slight variants of them, are surprisingly common on Wall Street, and the schedule is usually derived from historical intraday volume data.",
                "Our next result demonstrates that such algorithms can perform considerably worse than dynamically adaptive algorithms in terms of the worst case competitive ratio.",
                "Theorem 3.",
                "In the price-volume model under both the volume and price variability assumptions, any fixed schedule VWAP algorithm A for selling N shares has sell VWAP competitive ratio RVWAP(A) = Ω(min(T, R)).",
                "The proofs of all the results in this subsection are in the Appendix.",
                "So far our emphasis has been on VWAP algorithms that must sell exactly N shares.",
                "In many realistic circumstances, however, there is actually some flexibility in the precise number of shares to be sold.",
                "For instance, this is true at large brokerages, where many separate VWAP trades may be pooled and executed by a common algorithm, and the firm would be quite willing to carry a small position of unsold shares overnight if it resulted in better execution prices.",
                "The following theorem (which interestingly has no analogue for the OWT problem) demonstrates that this trade-off in shares sold and performance can be realized dramatically in our model.",
                "It states that if we are willing to let the number of shares sold vary with Q, we can in fact achieve a VWAP competitive ratio of 1.",
                "Theorem 4.",
                "In the price-volume model under the volume variability assumption, there exists an algorithm A that always sells between N and QN shares and that the average price per sold share is exactly VWAPM (S).",
                "In many online problems, there is a clear distinction between benefit problems and cost problems [2].",
                "In the VWAP setting, selling shares is a benefit problem, and buying shares is a cost problem.",
                "The definitions of the competitive ratios, Rbuy VWAP(A) and Rbuy OWT(A), for algorithms which Figure 2: Sample Island order books for MSFT. buy exactly N shares are maxS∈Σ{VWAPA(S)/VWAPM (S)} and maxS∈Σ maxt{VWAPA(S)/pt} respectively.",
                "Eventhough Theorem 4 also holds for buying, in general, the competitive ratio of the buy (cost) problem is much higher, as stated in the following theorem.",

                "In addition any online algorithm A for buying N shares has buy VWAP competitive ratio Rbuy VWAP(A) = Ω(min{Q, √ R}). 3.",
                "A <br>limit order book trading model</br> Before we can define our online trading model based on limit order books, we give some necessary background on the detailed mechanics of financial markets, which are sometimes referred to as market microstructure.",
                "We then provide results and algorithms for both the OWT and VWAP problems. 192 3.1 Background on Limit Order Books and Market Microstructure A fundamental distinction in stock trading is that between a limit order and a market order.",
                "Suppose we wish to purchase 1000 shares of Microsoft (MSFT) stock.",
                "In a limit order, we specify not only the desired volume (1000 shares), but also the desired price.",
                "Suppose that MSFT is currently trading at roughly $24.07 a share (see Figure 2, which shows an actual snapshot of a recent MSFT order book on Island (www.island.com), a well-known electronic exchange for NASDAQ stocks), but we are only willing to buy the 1000 shares at $24.04 a share or lower.",
                "We can choose to submit a limit order with this specification, and our order will be placed in a queue called the buy order book, which is ordered by price, with the highest offered unexecuted buy price at the top (often referred to as the bid).",
                "If there are multiple limit orders at the same price, they are ordered by time of arrival (with older orders higher in the book).",
                "In the example provided by Figure 2, our order would be placed immediately after the extant order for 5,503 shares at $24.04; though we offer the same price, this order has arrived before ours.",
                "Similarly, a sell order book for sell limit orders (for instance, we might want to sell 500 shares of MSFT at $24.10 or higher) is maintained, this time with the lowest sell price offered (often referred to as the ask).",
                "Thus, the order books are sorted from the most competitive limit orders at the top (high buy prices and low sell prices) down to less competitive limit orders.",
                "The bid and ask prices (which again, are simply the prices in the limit orders at the top of the buy and sell books, respectively) together are sometimes referred to as the inside market, and the difference between them as the spread.",
                "By definition, the order books always consist exclusively of unexecuted orders - they are queues of orders hopefully waiting for the price to move in their direction.",
                "How then do orders get executed?",
                "There are two methods.",
                "First, any time a market order arrives, it is immediately matched with the most competitive limit orders on the opposing book.",
                "Thus, a market order to buy 2000 shares is matched with enough volume on the sell order book to fill the 2000 shares.",
                "For instance, in the example of Figure 2, such an order would be filled by the two limit sell orders for 500 shares at $24.069, the 500 shares at $24.07, the 200 shares at $24.08, and then 300 of the 1981 shares at $24.09.",
                "The remaining 1681 shares of this last limit order would remain as the new top of the sell limit order book.",
                "Second, if a buy (sell, respectively) limit order comes in above the ask (below the bid, respectively) price, then the order is matched with orders on the opposing books.",
                "It is important to note that the prices of executions are the prices specified in the limit orders already in the books, not the prices of the incoming order that is immediately executed.",
                "Every market or limit order arrives atomically and instantaneously - there is a strict temporal sequence in which orders arrive, and two orders can never arrive simultaneously.",
                "This gives rise to the definition of the last price of the exchange, which is simply the last price at which the exchange executed an order.",
                "It is this quantity that is usually meant when people casually refer to the (ticker) price of a stock.",
                "Note that a limit buy (sell, respectively) order with a price of infinity (0, respectively) is effectively a market order.",
                "We shall thus assume without loss of generality that all orders are placed as limit order.",
                "Although limit orders which are unexecuted may be removed by the party which placed them, for simplicity, we assume that limit orders are never removed from the books.",

Here t = 0 corresponds to the days market open, and t = T to the close.",

                "The pair (pt, vt) represents the fact that a total of vt shares were traded at an (average) price per share pt in the market between time t − 1 and t. Realistically, we should imagine the number of intervals T being reasonably large, so that it is sensible to assign a common approximate price to all shares traded within an interval.",
                "In the price-volume model, we shall make an infinite liquidity assumption for our trading algorithms.",

                "Let us assume that our goal is to sell N shares over the course of the day.",
                "Hence, at each time, we must select a (possibly fractional) number of shares nt to sell at price pt, subject to the global constraint T t=1 nt = N. It is thus assumed that if we have left over shares to sell after time T − 1, we are forced to sell them at the closing price of the market - that is, nT = N − T −1 t=1 nt is sold at pT .",
                "In this way we are certain to sell exactly N shares over the course of the day; the only thing an algorithm must do is determine the schedule of selling based on the incoming market price-volume stream.",

                "If we keep the hard constraint of selling exactly N shares, we might incur an additional slight loss in the conversion. (Note that we only allow fractional volumes in the price-volume model, where liquidity is not an issue.",
                "In the order book model to follow, we do not allow fractional volumes.)",
                "In VWAP trading, the goal of an online algorithm A which sells exactly N shares is not to maximize profits per se, but to track the market VWAP.",
                "The market VWAP for an intraday trading sequence S = (p1, v1), . . . , (pT , vT ) is simply the average price paid per share over the course of the trading 190 day, ie VWAPM (S) = T t=1 ptvt /V where V is the total daily volume, i.e., V = T t=1 vt.",
                "If on the sequence S, the algorithm A sells its N stocks using the volume sequence n1, . . . nT , then we analogously define the VWAP of A on market sequence S by VWAPA(S) = T t=1 ptnt /N .",

                "We note that unlike on Wall Street, our definition of VWAPM does not take our own trading into account.",
                "It is easy to see that this makes it a more challenging criterion to track.",
                "In contrast to the VWAP, another common measure of the performance of an online selling algorithm would be its one-way trading (OWT) competitive ratio [3] with respect to a set of sequences Σ: ROWT(A) = max S∈Σ max 1≤t≤T {pt/VWAPA(S)} where the algorithms performance is compared to the largest individual price appearing in the sequence S. In both VWAP and OWT, we are comparing the average price per share received by a selling algorithm to some measure of market performance.",

                "However, RVWAP(A) cannot be smaller than 1, since on any sequence S in which all price pt are identical, it is impossible to get a better average share per price.",
                "Thus, for all algorithms A, both RVWAP(A) and ROWT(A) are larger than 1, and the closer to 1 they are, the better A is tracking its respective performance measure. 2.2 VWAP Results in the Price-Volume Model As in previous work on online trading, it is generally not possible to obtain finite bounds on competitive ratios with absolutely no assumptions on the set of sequences Σbounds on the maximum variation in price or volume are required, depending on the exact setting.",

                "In the case of Q = 1 (where the total volume V over the trading period is known), we can gain a competitive ratio of 1 by selling vt V N shares after each time period.",
                "For the OWT problem in the price-volume model, volumes are irrelevant for the performance criterion, but for the VWAP criterion they are central.",
                "For the OWT problem under the price variability assumption, the results of [3] established that the optimal competitive ratio was Θ(log(R)).",
                "Our first result establishes that the optimal competitive ratio for VWAP under the volume variability assumption is Θ(log(Q)) and is achieved by an algorithm that ignores the price data.",

                "The prices in the VWAP sequence are the same as in S. To construct the volumes in the VWAP sequence, we segment the prices in S into log(R) intervals [2i−1 pmin , 2i pmin ).",

                "Typically, such a fund manager would be unqualified to sell such a large number of shares in the open market - it requires a professional broker to intelligently break the trade up over time, and possibly over multiple exchanges, in order to minimize the market impact of such a sizable transaction.",
                "Thus, the fund manager would approach brokerages for help in selling the 1%.",

                "Hence, at each time, we must select a (possibly fractional) number of shares nt to sell at price pt, subject to the global constraint T t=1 nt = N. It is thus assumed that if we have left over shares to sell after time T − 1, we are forced to sell them at the closing price of the market - that is, nT = N − T −1 t=1 nt is sold at pT .",

                "In contrast to the VWAP, another common measure of the performance of an online selling algorithm would be its one-way trading (OWT) competitive ratio [3] with respect to a set of sequences Σ: ROWT(A) = max S∈Σ max 1≤t≤T {pt/VWAPA(S)} where the algorithms performance is compared to the largest individual price appearing in the sequence S. In both VWAP and OWT, we are comparing the average price per share received by a selling algorithm to some measure of market performance.",

                "Thus, the fund manager would approach brokerages for help in selling the 1%.",
                "The brokerage will typically alleviate the fund managers problem immediately by simply buying the shares directly from the fund manager, and then selling them off laterbut what price should the brokerage pay the fund manager?",

                "The usual answer is that the brokerage offers to buy the shares from the fund manager at a per-share price tied to the VWAP over some future period - in our example, the brokerage might offer to buy the 1% at a per-share price of the coming months VWAP minus 1 cent.",
                "The brokerage now has a very clean challenge: by selling the shares themselves over the next month in a way that exactly matches the VWAP, a penny per share is earned in profits.",

Here t = 0 corresponds to the days market open, and t = T to the close.",

                "The pair (pt, vt) represents the fact that a total of vt shares were traded at an (average) price per share pt in the market between time t − 1 and t. Realistically, we should imagine the number of intervals T being reasonably large, so that it is sensible to assign a common approximate price to all shares traded within an interval.",
                "In the price-volume model, we shall make an infinite liquidity assumption for our trading algorithms.",
                "More precisely, in this online model, we see the price-volume sequence one pair at a time.",

                "Let us assume that our goal is to sell N shares over the course of the day.",
                "Hence, at each time, we must select a (possibly fractional) number of shares nt to sell at price pt, subject to the global constraint T t=1 nt = N. It is thus assumed that if we have left over shares to sell after time T − 1, we are forced to sell them at the closing price of the market - that is, nT = N − T −1 t=1 nt is sold at pT .",
                "In this way we are certain to sell exactly N shares over the course of the day; the only thing an algorithm must do is determine the schedule of selling based on the incoming market price-volume stream.",
                "Any algorithm which sells fractional volumes can be converted to a randomized algorithm which only sells integral volumes with the same expected number of shares sold.",
                "If we keep the hard constraint of selling exactly N shares, we might incur an additional slight loss in the conversion. (Note that we only allow fractional volumes in the price-volume model, where liquidity is not an issue.",
                "In the order book model to follow, we do not allow fractional volumes.)",
                "In VWAP trading, the goal of an online algorithm A which sells exactly N shares is not to maximize profits per se, but to track the market VWAP.",
                "The market VWAP for an intraday trading sequence S = (p1, v1), . . . , (pT , vT ) is simply the average price paid per share over the course of the trading 190 day, ie VWAPM (S) = T t=1 ptvt /V where V is the total daily volume, i.e., V = T t=1 vt.",

                "We note that unlike on Wall Street, our definition of VWAPM does not take our own trading into account.",
                "It is easy to see that this makes it a more challenging criterion to track.",
                "In contrast to the VWAP, another common measure of the performance of an online selling algorithm would be its one-way trading (OWT) competitive ratio [3] with respect to a set of sequences Σ: ROWT(A) = max S∈Σ max 1≤t≤T {pt/VWAPA(S)} where the algorithms performance is compared to the largest individual price appearing in the sequence S. In both VWAP and OWT, we are comparing the average price per share received by a selling algorithm to some measure of market performance.",
                "In the case of OWT, we compare to the rather ambitious benchmark of the high price of the day, ignoring volumes entirely.",
                "In VWAP trading, we have the more modest goal of comparing favorably to the overall market average of the day.",
                "As we shall see, there are some important commonalities and differences to these two approaches.",
                "For now we note one simple fact: on any specific sequence S, VWAPA(S) may be larger that VWAPM (S).",
                "However, RVWAP(A) cannot be smaller than 1, since on any sequence S in which all price pt are identical, it is impossible to get a better average share per price.",
                "Thus, for all algorithms A, both RVWAP(A) and ROWT(A) are larger than 1, and the closer to 1 they are, the better A is tracking its respective performance measure. 2.2 VWAP Results in the Price-Volume Model As in previous work on online trading, it is generally not possible to obtain finite bounds on competitive ratios with absolutely no assumptions on the set of sequences Σbounds on the maximum variation in price or volume are required, depending on the exact setting.",
                "We thus introduce the following two assumptions. 2.2.0.1 Volume Variability Assumption.. Let 0 < Vmin ≤ Vmax be known positive constants, and define Q = Vmax /Vmin .",

                "For all intraday trading sequences S ∈ Σ, the prices satisfy pt ∈ [pmin, pmax], for all t = 1, . . . , T. Competitive ratios are generally taken over all sets Σ consistent with at least one of these assumptions.",
                "To gain some intuition consider the two trivial cases of R = 1 and Q = 1.",
                "In the case of R = 1 (where there is no fluctuation in price), any schedule is optimal.",
                "In the case of Q = 1 (where the total volume V over the trading period is known), we can gain a competitive ratio of 1 by selling vt V N shares after each time period.",
                "For the OWT problem in the price-volume model, volumes are irrelevant for the performance criterion, but for the VWAP criterion they are central.",
                "For the OWT problem under the price variability assumption, the results of [3] established that the optimal competitive ratio was Θ(log(R)).",
                "Our first result establishes that the optimal competitive ratio for VWAP under the volume variability assumption is Θ(log(Q)) and is achieved by an algorithm that ignores the price data.",

                "In addition, if only the volume variability (and not the price variability) assumption holds, any online algorithm A for selling N shares has RVWAP(A) = Ω(log(Q)).",
                "Proof. (Sketch) For the upper bound, the idea is similar to the price reservation algorithm of [3] for the OWT problem, and similar in spirit to the general technique of classify and select [1].",

                "The prices in the VWAP sequence are the same as in S. To construct the volumes in the VWAP sequence, we segment the prices in S into log(R) intervals [2i−1 pmin , 2i pmin ).",

                "This flexibility of approach derives from the fact that the VWAP is a quantity in which both prices and volumes matter, as opposed to OWT. 2.3 RelatedResultsinthePrice-VolumeModel All of the VWAP algorithms we have discussed so far make some use of the daily data (pt, vt) as it unfolds, using either the price or volume information.",

                "Typically, such a fund manager would be unqualified to sell such a large number of shares in the open market - it requires a professional broker to intelligently break the trade up over time, and possibly over multiple exchanges, in order to minimize the market impact of such a sizable transaction.",
                "Thus, the fund manager would approach brokerages for help in selling the 1%.",

Here t = 0 corresponds to the days market open, and t = T to the close.",

                "Let us assume that our goal is to sell N shares over the course of the day.",
                "Hence, at each time, we must select a (possibly fractional) number of shares nt to sell at price pt, subject to the global constraint T t=1 nt = N. It is thus assumed that if we have left over shares to sell after time T − 1, we are forced to sell them at the closing price of the market - that is, nT = N − T −1 t=1 nt is sold at pT .",
                "In this way we are certain to sell exactly N shares over the course of the day; the only thing an algorithm must do is determine the schedule of selling based on the incoming market price-volume stream.",

                "If we keep the hard constraint of selling exactly N shares, we might incur an additional slight loss in the conversion. (Note that we only allow fractional volumes in the price-volume model, where liquidity is not an issue.",
                "In the order book model to follow, we do not allow fractional volumes.)",
                "In VWAP trading, the goal of an online algorithm A which sells exactly N shares is not to maximize profits per se, but to track the market VWAP.",

                "We note that unlike on Wall Street, our definition of VWAPM does not take our own trading into account.",
                "It is easy to see that this makes it a more challenging criterion to track.",
                "In contrast to the VWAP, another common measure of the performance of an online selling algorithm would be its one-way trading (OWT) competitive ratio [3] with respect to a set of sequences Σ: ROWT(A) = max S∈Σ max 1≤t≤T {pt/VWAPA(S)} where the algorithms performance is compared to the largest individual price appearing in the sequence S. In both VWAP and OWT, we are comparing the average price per share received by a selling algorithm to some measure of market performance.",

                "In VWAP trading, we have the more modest goal of comparing favorably to the overall market average of the day.",
                "As we shall see, there are some important commonalities and differences to these two approaches.",

                "However, RVWAP(A) cannot be smaller than 1, since on any sequence S in which all price pt are identical, it is impossible to get a better average share per price.",
                "Thus, for all algorithms A, both RVWAP(A) and ROWT(A) are larger than 1, and the closer to 1 they are, the better A is tracking its respective performance measure. 2.2 VWAP Results in the Price-Volume Model As in previous work on online trading, it is generally not possible to obtain finite bounds on competitive ratios with absolutely no assumptions on the set of sequences Σbounds on the maximum variation in price or volume are required, depending on the exact setting.",
                "We thus introduce the following two assumptions. 2.2.0.1 Volume Variability Assumption.. Let 0 < Vmin ≤ Vmax be known positive constants, and define Q = Vmax /Vmin .",

                "In the case of R = 1 (where there is no fluctuation in price), any schedule is optimal.",
                "In the case of Q = 1 (where the total volume V over the trading period is known), we can gain a competitive ratio of 1 by selling vt V N shares after each time period.",
                "For the OWT problem in the price-volume model, volumes are irrelevant for the performance criterion, but for the VWAP criterion they are central.",
                "For the OWT problem under the price variability assumption, the results of [3] established that the optimal competitive ratio was Θ(log(R)).",
                "Our first result establishes that the optimal competitive ratio for VWAP under the volume variability assumption is Θ(log(Q)) and is achieved by an algorithm that ignores the price data.",

                "INTRODUCTION While popular images of Wall Street often depict swashbuckling traders boldly making large gambles on just their market intuitions, the vast majority of trading is actually considerably more technical and constrained.",
                "The constraints often derive from a complex combination of business, regulatory and institutional issues, and result in certain kinds of standard trading strategies or criteria that invite algorithmic analysis.",
                "One of the most common activities in modern financial markets is known as Volume Weighted Average Price, or VWAP, trading.",
                "Informally, the VWAP of a stock over a specified market period is simply the average price paid per share during that period, so the price of each transaction in the market is weighted by its volume.",
                "In VWAP trading, one attempts to buy or sell a fixed number of shares at a price that closely tracks the VWAP.",
                "Very large institutional trades constitute one of the main motivations behind VWAP activity.",
                "A typical scenario goes as follows.",
                "Suppose a very large mutual fund holds 3% of the outstanding shares of a large, publicly traded company - a huge fraction of the shares - and that this funds manager decides he would like to reduce this holding to 2% over a 1-month period. (Such a decision might be forced by the funds own regulations or other considerations.)",
                "Typically, such a fund manager would be unqualified to sell such a large number of shares in the open market - it requires a professional broker to intelligently break the trade up over time, and possibly over multiple exchanges, in order to minimize the market impact of such a sizable transaction.",
                "Thus, the fund manager would approach brokerages for help in selling the 1%.",
                "The brokerage will typically alleviate the fund managers problem immediately by simply buying the shares directly from the fund manager, and then selling them off laterbut what price should the brokerage pay the fund manager?",
                "Paying the price on the day of the sale is too risky for the brokerage, as they need to sell the shares themselves over an extended period, and events beyond their control (such as wars) could cause the price to fall dramatically.",
                "The usual answer is that the brokerage offers to buy the shares from the fund manager at a per-share price tied to the VWAP over some future period - in our example, the brokerage might offer to buy the 1% at a per-share price of the coming months VWAP minus 1 cent.",
                "The brokerage now has a very clean challenge: by selling the shares themselves over the next month in a way that exactly matches the VWAP, a penny per share is earned in profits.",
                "If they can beat the VWAP by a penny, they make two cents per share.",
                "Such small-margin, high-volume profits can be extremely lucrative for a large brokerage.",
                "The importance of the VWAP has led to many automated VWAP trading algorithms - indeed, every major brokerage has at least one VWAP box, 189 Price Volume Model Order Book Model Macroscopic Distribution Model OWT Θ(log(R)) (From[3]) O(log(R) log(N)) 2E(Pbins maxprice ) 2(1 + )E(Pbins maxprice ) for -approx of Pbins maxprice Θ(log(Q)) (same as above plus...)

                "The parameter R represents a bound on the maximum to the minimum price fluctuation and the parameter Q represents a bound on the maximum to minimum volume fluctuation in the respective model. (See Section 4 for a description of the Macroscopic Distribution Model.)",
                "All the results for the OWT trading criterion (which is a stronger criterion) directly translate to the VWAP criterion.",
                "However, in the VWAP setting, considering a restriction on the maximum to the minimum volume fluctuation Q, leads to an additional class of results which depends on Q. and some small companies focus exclusively on proprietary VWAP trading technology.",
                "In this paper, we provide the first study of VWAP trading algorithms in an online, competitive ratio setting.",
                "We first formalize the VWAP trading problem in a basic online model we call the price-volume model, which can be viewed as a generalization of previous theoretical online trading models incorporating market volume information.",
                "In this model, we provide VWAP algorithms and competitive ratios, and compare this setting with the one-way trading (OWT) problem studied in [3].",
                "Our most interesting results, however, examine the VWAP trading problem in a new online trading model capturing the important recent phenomenon of limit order books in financial markets.",
                "Briefly, a limit buy or sell order specifies both the number of shares and the desired price, and will only be executed if there is a matching party on the opposing side, according to a well-defined matching procedure used by all the major exchanges.",
                "While limit order books (the list of limit orders awaiting possible future execution) have existed since the dawn of equity exchanges, only very recently have these books become visible to traders in real time, thus opening the way to trading algorithms of all varieties that attempt to exploit this rich market microstructure data.",
                "Such data and algorithms are a topic of great current interest on Wall Street [4].",
                "We thus introduce a new online trading model incorporating limit order books, and examine both the one-way and VWAP trading problems in it.",
                "Our results are summarized in Figure 1 (see the caption for a summary). 2.",
                "THEPRICE-VOLUMETRADINGMODEL We now present a trading model which includes both price and volume information about the sequence of trades.",
                "While this model is a generalization of previous formalisms for online trading, it makes an infinite liquidity assumption which fails to model the negative market impact that trading a large number of shares typically has.",
                "This will be addressed in the order book model studied in the next section.",
                "A note on terminology: throughout the paper (unless otherwise specified), we shall use the term market to describe all activity or orders other than those of the algorithm under consideration.",
                "The setting we consider can be viewed as a game between our algorithm and the market. 2.1 The Model In the price-volume trading model, we assume that the intraday trading activity in a given stock is summarized by a discrete sequence of price and volume pairs (pt, vt) for t = 1, . . . , T. Here t = 0 corresponds to the days market open, and t = T to the close.",
                "While there is nothing technically special about the time horizon of a single day, it is particularly consistent with limit order book trading on Wall Street.",
                "The pair (pt, vt) represents the fact that a total of vt shares were traded at an (average) price per share pt in the market between time t − 1 and t. Realistically, we should imagine the number of intervals T being reasonably large, so that it is sensible to assign a common approximate price to all shares traded within an interval.",
                "In the price-volume model, we shall make an infinite liquidity assumption for our trading algorithms.",
                "More precisely, in this online model, we see the price-volume sequence one pair at a time.",
                "Following the observation of (pt, vt), we are permitted to sell any (possibly fractional) number of shares nt at the price pt.",
                "Let us assume that our goal is to sell N shares over the course of the day.",
                "Hence, at each time, we must select a (possibly fractional) number of shares nt to sell at price pt, subject to the global constraint T t=1 nt = N. It is thus assumed that if we have left over shares to sell after time T − 1, we are forced to sell them at the closing price of the market - that is, nT = N − T −1 t=1 nt is sold at pT .",
                "In this way we are certain to sell exactly N shares over the course of the day; the only thing an algorithm must do is determine the schedule of selling based on the incoming market price-volume stream.",
                "Any algorithm which sells fractional volumes can be converted to a randomized algorithm which only sells integral volumes with the same expected number of shares sold.",
                "If we keep the hard constraint of selling exactly N shares, we might incur an additional slight loss in the conversion. (Note that we only allow fractional volumes in the price-volume model, where liquidity is not an issue.",
                "In the order book model to follow, we do not allow fractional volumes.)",
                "In VWAP trading, the goal of an online algorithm A which sells exactly N shares is not to maximize profits per se, but to track the market VWAP.",
                "The market VWAP for an intraday trading sequence S = (p1, v1), . . . , (pT , vT ) is simply the average price paid per share over the course of the trading 190 day, ie VWAPM (S) = T t=1 ptvt /V where V is the total daily volume, i.e., V = T t=1 vt.",
                "If on the sequence S, the algorithm A sells its N stocks using the volume sequence n1, . . . nT , then we analogously define the VWAP of A on market sequence S by VWAPA(S) = T t=1 ptnt /N .",
                "Note that the market VWAP does not include the shares that the algorithm sells.",
                "The VWAP competitive ratio of A with respect to a set of sequences Σ is then RVWAP(A) = max S∈Σ {VWAPM (S)/VWAPA(S)} In the case that A is randomized, we generalize the definition above by taking an expectation over VWAPA(S) inside the max.",
                "We note that unlike on Wall Street, our definition of VWAPM does not take our own trading into account.",
                "It is easy to see that this makes it a more challenging criterion to track.",
                "In contrast to the VWAP, another common measure of the performance of an online selling algorithm would be its one-way trading (OWT) competitive ratio [3] with respect to a set of sequences Σ: ROWT(A) = max S∈Σ max 1≤t≤T {pt/VWAPA(S)} where the algorithms performance is compared to the largest individual price appearing in the sequence S. In both VWAP and OWT, we are comparing the average price per share received by a selling algorithm to some measure of market performance.",
                "In the case of OWT, we compare to the rather ambitious benchmark of the high price of the day, ignoring volumes entirely.",
                "In VWAP trading, we have the more modest goal of comparing favorably to the overall market average of the day.",
                "As we shall see, there are some important commonalities and differences to these two approaches.",
                "For now we note one simple fact: on any specific sequence S, VWAPA(S) may be larger that VWAPM (S).",
                "However, RVWAP(A) cannot be smaller than 1, since on any sequence S in which all price pt are identical, it is impossible to get a better average share per price.",
                "Thus, for all algorithms A, both RVWAP(A) and ROWT(A) are larger than 1, and the closer to 1 they are, the better A is tracking its respective performance measure. 2.2 VWAP Results in the Price-Volume Model As in previous work on online trading, it is generally not possible to obtain finite bounds on competitive ratios with absolutely no assumptions on the set of sequences Σbounds on the maximum variation in price or volume are required, depending on the exact setting.",
                "We thus introduce the following two assumptions. 2.2.0.1 Volume Variability Assumption.. Let 0 < Vmin ≤ Vmax be known positive constants, and define Q = Vmax /Vmin .",
                "For all intraday trading sequences S ∈ Σ, the total daily volume V ∈ [Vmin , Vmax ]. 2.2.0.2 Price Variability Assumption.. Let 0 < pmin ≤ pmax be known positive constants, and define R = pmax/pmin.",
                "For all intraday trading sequences S ∈ Σ, the prices satisfy pt ∈ [pmin, pmax], for all t = 1, . . . , T. Competitive ratios are generally taken over all sets Σ consistent with at least one of these assumptions.",
                "To gain some intuition consider the two trivial cases of R = 1 and Q = 1.",
                "In the case of R = 1 (where there is no fluctuation in price), any schedule is optimal.",
                "In the case of Q = 1 (where the total volume V over the trading period is known), we can gain a competitive ratio of 1 by selling vt V N shares after each time period.",
                "For the OWT problem in the price-volume model, volumes are irrelevant for the performance criterion, but for the VWAP criterion they are central.",
                "For the OWT problem under the price variability assumption, the results of [3] established that the optimal competitive ratio was Θ(log(R)).",
                "Our first result establishes that the optimal competitive ratio for VWAP under the volume variability assumption is Θ(log(Q)) and is achieved by an algorithm that ignores the price data.",
                "Theorem 1.",
                "In the price-volume model under the volume variability assumption, there exists an online algorithm A for selling N shares achieving competitive ratio RVWAP(A) ≤ 2 log(Q).",
                "In addition, if only the volume variability (and not the price variability) assumption holds, any online algorithm A for selling N shares has RVWAP(A) = Ω(log(Q)).",
                "Proof. (Sketch) For the upper bound, the idea is similar to the price reservation algorithm of [3] for the OWT problem, and similar in spirit to the general technique of classify and select [1].",
                "Consider algorithms which use a parameter ˆV , which is interpreted as an estimate for the total volume for the day.",
                "Then at each time t, if the market price and volume is (pt, vt), the algorithm sells a fraction vt/ ˆV of its shares.",
                "We consider a family of log(Q) such algorithms, where algorithm Ai uses ˆV = Vmin 2i−1 .",
                "Clearly, one of the Ai has a competitive ratio of 2.",
                "We can derive an O(log(Q)) VWAP competitive ratio by running these algorithms in parallel, and letting each algorithm sell N/ log(Q) shares. (Alternatively, we can randomly select one Ai and guarantee the same expected competitive ratio.)",
                "We now sketch the proof of the lower bound, which relates performance in the VWAP and OWT problems.",
                "Any algorithm that is c-competitive in the VWAP setting (under fixed Q) is 3c-competitive in the OWT setting with R = Q/2.",
                "To show this, we take any sequence S of prices for the OWT problem, and convert it into a price-volume sequence for the VWAP problem.",
                "The prices in the VWAP sequence are the same as in S. To construct the volumes in the VWAP sequence, we segment the prices in S into log(R) intervals [2i−1 pmin , 2i pmin ).",
                "Suppose pt ∈ [2i−1 pmin , 2i pmin ), and this is the first time in S that a price has fallen in this interval.",
                "Then in the VWAP sequence we set the volume vt = 2i−1 .",
                "If this is not the first visit to the interval containing pt, we set vt = 0.",
                "Assume that the maximum price in S is pmax .",
                "The VWAP of our sequence is at least pmax /3.",
                "Since we had a c competitive algorithm, its average sell is at least pmax /3c.",
                "The lower bound now follows using the lower bound in [3].",
                "An alternative approach to VWAP is to ignore the volumes in favor of prices, and apply an algorithm for the OWT problem.",
                "Note that the lower bound in this theorem, unlike in the previous one, only assumes a price variation bound. 191 Theorem 2.",
                "In the price-volume model under the price variability assumption, there exists an online algorithm A for selling N shares achieving competitive ratio RVWAP(A) = O(log(R)).",
                "In addition, if only the price variability (and not the volume variability) assumption holds, any online A for selling N shares has RVWAP(A) = Ω(log(R)).",
                "Proof. (Sketch) Follows immediately from the results of [3] for OWT: the upper bound from the simple fact that for any sequence S, VWAPA(S) is less than max1≤t≤T {pt}, and the lower bound from a reduction to OWT.",
                "Theorems 1 and 2 demonstrate that one can achieve logarithmic VWAP competitive ratios under the assumption of either bounded variability of total volume or bounded variability of maximum price.",
                "If both assumptions hold, it is possible to give an algorithm accomplishing the minimum of log(Q) and log(R).",
                "This flexibility of approach derives from the fact that the VWAP is a quantity in which both prices and volumes matter, as opposed to OWT. 2.3 RelatedResultsinthePrice-VolumeModel All of the VWAP algorithms we have discussed so far make some use of the daily data (pt, vt) as it unfolds, using either the price or volume information.",
                "In contrast, a fixed schedule VWAP algorithm has a predetermined distribution {f1, f2, . . . fT }, and simply sells ftN shares at time t, independent of (pt, vt).",
                "Fixed schedule VWAP algorithms, or slight variants of them, are surprisingly common on Wall Street, and the schedule is usually derived from historical intraday volume data.",
                "Our next result demonstrates that such algorithms can perform considerably worse than dynamically adaptive algorithms in terms of the worst case competitive ratio.",
                "Theorem 3.",
                "In the price-volume model under both the volume and price variability assumptions, any fixed schedule VWAP algorithm A for selling N shares has sell VWAP competitive ratio RVWAP(A) = Ω(min(T, R)).",
                "The proofs of all the results in this subsection are in the Appendix.",
                "So far our emphasis has been on VWAP algorithms that must sell exactly N shares.",
                "In many realistic circumstances, however, there is actually some flexibility in the precise number of shares to be sold.",
                "For instance, this is true at large brokerages, where many separate VWAP trades may be pooled and executed by a common algorithm, and the firm would be quite willing to carry a small position of unsold shares overnight if it resulted in better execution prices.",
                "The following theorem (which interestingly has no analogue for the OWT problem) demonstrates that this trade-off in shares sold and performance can be realized dramatically in our model.",
                "It states that if we are willing to let the number of shares sold vary with Q, we can in fact achieve a VWAP competitive ratio of 1.",

Here t = 0 corresponds to the days market open, and t = T to the close.",

                "Let us assume that our goal is to sell N shares over the course of the day.",
                "Hence, at each time, we must select a (possibly fractional) number of shares nt to sell at price pt, subject to the global constraint T t=1 nt = N. It is thus assumed that if we have left over shares to sell after time T − 1, we are forced to sell them at the closing price of the market - that is, nT = N − T −1 t=1 nt is sold at pT .",

                "If we keep the hard constraint of selling exactly N shares, we might incur an additional slight loss in the conversion. (Note that we only allow fractional volumes in the price-volume model, where liquidity is not an issue.",
                "In the order book model to follow, we do not allow fractional volumes.)",
                "In VWAP trading, the goal of an online algorithm A which sells exactly N shares is not to maximize profits per se, but to track the market VWAP.",
                "The market VWAP for an intraday trading sequence S = (p1, v1), . . . , (pT , vT ) is simply the average price paid per share over the course of the trading 190 day, ie VWAPM (S) = T t=1 ptvt /V where V is the total daily volume, i.e., V = T t=1 vt.",

                "We note that unlike on Wall Street, our definition of VWAPM does not take our own trading into account.",
                "It is easy to see that this makes it a more challenging criterion to track.",
                "In contrast to the VWAP, another common measure of the performance of an online selling algorithm would be its one-way trading (OWT) competitive ratio [3] with respect to a set of sequences Σ: ROWT(A) = max S∈Σ max 1≤t≤T {pt/VWAPA(S)} where the algorithms performance is compared to the largest individual price appearing in the sequence S. In both VWAP and OWT, we are comparing the average price per share received by a selling algorithm to some measure of market performance.",

                "However, RVWAP(A) cannot be smaller than 1, since on any sequence S in which all price pt are identical, it is impossible to get a better average share per price.",
                "Thus, for all algorithms A, both RVWAP(A) and ROWT(A) are larger than 1, and the closer to 1 they are, the better A is tracking its respective performance measure. 2.2 VWAP Results in the Price-Volume Model As in previous work on online trading, it is generally not possible to obtain finite bounds on competitive ratios with absolutely no assumptions on the set of sequences Σbounds on the maximum variation in price or volume are required, depending on the exact setting.",
                "We thus introduce the following two assumptions. 2.2.0.1 Volume Variability Assumption.. Let 0 < Vmin ≤ Vmax be known positive constants, and define Q = Vmax /Vmin .",

                "In the case of Q = 1 (where the total volume V over the trading period is known), we can gain a competitive ratio of 1 by selling vt V N shares after each time period.",
                "For the OWT problem in the price-volume model, volumes are irrelevant for the performance criterion, but for the VWAP criterion they are central.",
                "For the OWT problem under the price variability assumption, the results of [3] established that the optimal competitive ratio was Θ(log(R)).",
                "Our first result establishes that the optimal competitive ratio for VWAP under the volume variability assumption is Θ(log(Q)) and is achieved by an algorithm that ignores the price data.",

                "The usual answer is that the brokerage offers to buy the shares from the fund manager at a per-share price tied to the <br>vwap</br> over some future period - in our example, the brokerage might offer to buy the 1% at a per-share price of the coming months <br>vwap</br> minus 1 cent.",

                "Una de las actividades más comunes en los mercados financieros modernos se conoce como precio promedio ponderado por volumen, o \"VWAP\", negociación.VWAP",
                "Informalmente, el \"VWAP\" de una acción durante un período de mercado especificado es simplemente el precio promedio pagado por acción durante ese período, por lo que el precio de cada transacción en el mercado está ponderado por su volumen.VWAP",

                "Los oficios institucionales muy grandes constituyen una de las principales motivaciones detrás de la actividad \"VWAP\".VWAP",
                "La respuesta habitual es que la corredora ofrece comprar las acciones del Administrador de fondos a un precio por acción vinculado al \"VWAP\" durante algún período futuro; en nuestro ejemplo, la corredora podría ofrecer comprar el 1% a una per-Precio de las acciones de los próximos meses \"VWAP\" menos 1 centavo.VWAP",
                "La corredora ahora tiene un desafío muy limpio: al vender las acciones en el próximo mes de una manera que coincida exactamente con el \"VWAP\", se obtiene un centavo por acción en las ganancias.VWAP",
                "Si pueden vencer el \"VWAP\" por un centavo, hacen dos centavos por acción.VWAP",
                "La importancia del \"VWAP\" ha llevado a muchos algoritmos de comercio automatizados de \"VWAP\": de hecho, cada corretaje importante tiene al menos una caja de VWAP, 189 Price Volume Modelo de pedido Modelo de distribución macroscópica Modelo de distribución macroscópica OWT θ (LOG (R)) (de[3]) o (log (r) log (n)) 2e (pbins maxprice) 2 (1 +) e (pbins maxprice) para -aprox de pbins maxprice θ (log (q)) (igual que anterior más ...)

                "Sin embargo, en el entorno \"VWAP\", considerando una restricción en el máximo de la fluctuación mínima de volumen Q, conduce a una clase adicional de resultados que depende de Q. y algunas pequeñas empresas se centran exclusivamente en la tecnología de comercio \"VWAP\" patentada.VWAP",
                "En este documento, proporcionamos el primer estudio de los algoritmos comerciales \"VWAP\" en una configuración de relación competitiva en línea.VWAP",
                "Primero formalizamos el problema comercial \"VWAP\" en un modelo básico en línea que llamamos el modelo de precio-volumen, que puede verse como una generalización de modelos de comercio en línea teóricos anteriores que incorporan información de volumen del mercado.VWAP",
                "En este modelo, proporcionamos algoritmos \"VWAP\" y proporciones competitivas, y comparamos esta configuración con el problema de comercio unidireccional (OWT) estudiado en [3].VWAP",
                "Sin embargo, nuestros resultados más interesantes examinan el problema comercial \"VWAP\" en un nuevo modelo de negociación en línea que captura el importante fenómeno reciente de los libros de pedidos límite en los mercados financieros.VWAP",
                "Por lo tanto, presentamos un nuevo modelo de negociación en línea que incorpora libros de pedidos de límites y examinamos los problemas comerciales unidireccionales y de \"VWAP\".VWAP",
                "En el comercio de \"VWAP\", el objetivo de un algoritmo en línea A que vende exactamente n acciones no es maximizar las ganancias per se, sino rastrear el mercado \"VWAP\".VWAP",
                "El mercado \"VWAP\" para una secuencia de negociación intradía S = (P1, V1) ,..., (PT, VT) es simplemente el precio promedio pagado por acción en el transcurso de la negociación de 190 días, es decir, VWAPM (S) = T T = 1 PTVT /V donde V es el volumen diario total, es decir, V = T T T= 1 Vt.VWAP",

                "En contraste con el \"VWAP\", otra medida común del rendimiento de un algoritmo de venta en línea sería su relación competitiva de comercio unidireccional (OWT) [3] con respecto a un conjunto de secuencias σ: Rowt (a) = max S∈σ max 1≤t≤t {PT/VWAPA (S)} Cuando el rendimiento de los algoritmos se compara con el precio individual más grande que aparece en la secuencia S. tanto en \"VWAP\" como en OWT, estamos comparando el precio promedio por acción recibidopor un algoritmo de venta a cierta medida del desempeño del mercado.VWAP",
                "En el comercio \"VWAP\", tenemos el objetivo más modesto de comparar favorablemente con el promedio general del mercado del día.VWAP",
                "Por lo tanto, para todos los algoritmos A, tanto RVWAP (a) como Rowt (a) son mayores que 1, y cuanto más cerca de 1 están, mejor A está rastreando su medida de rendimiento respectiva.2.2 \"VWAP\" da como resultado el modelo de precio-volumen como en el trabajo anterior en el comercio en línea, generalmente no es posible obtener límites finitos en relaciones competitivas con absolutamente ninguna suposición en el conjunto de secuencias σbounds en la variación máxima en el precio o el volumen sonrequerido, dependiendo de la configuración exacta.VWAP",
                "Para el problema de OWT en el modelo de precio-volumen, los volúmenes son irrelevantes para el criterio de rendimiento, pero para el criterio \"VWAP\" son centrales.VWAP",
                "Nuestro primer resultado establece que la relación competitiva óptima para \"VWAP\" bajo la suposición de variabilidad de volumen es θ (log (q)) y se logra mediante un algoritmo que ignora los datos de precios.VWAP",
                "Podemos derivar una relación competitiva O (log (Q)) \"VWAP\" ejecutando estos algoritmos en paralelo y permitiendo que cada algoritmo se venda N/ Log (Q) acciones.(Alternativamente, podemos seleccionar aleatoriamente una IA y garantizar la misma relación competitiva esperada). VWAP",
                "Ahora dibujamos la prueba del límite inferior, que relaciona el rendimiento en los problemas \"VWAP\" y OWT.VWAP",
                "Cualquier algoritmo que sea competitivo en C en la configuración \"VWAP\" (en Q fijo) es competitivo 3C en la configuración OWT con R = Q/2.VWAP",
                "Para mostrar esto, tomamos cualquier secuencia de precios para el problema de OWT y lo convertimos en una secuencia de precio-volumen para el problema \"VWAP\".VWAP",
                "Los precios en la secuencia \"VWAP\" son los mismos que en S. para construir los volúmenes en la secuencia \"VWAP\", segmentamos los precios en S en intervalos log (R) [2i - 1 PMIN, 2i PMIN).VWAP",
                "Luego, en la secuencia \"VWAP\", establecemos el volumen VT = 2i - 1.VWAP",
                "El \"VWAP\" de nuestra secuencia es al menos PMAX /3.VWAP",
                "Un enfoque alternativo para \"VWAP\" es ignorar los volúmenes a favor de los precios y aplicar un algoritmo para el problema de OWT.VWAP",
                "Los teoremas 1 y 2 demuestran que uno puede lograr relaciones competitivas logarítmicas \"VWAP\" bajo el supuesto de variabilidad limitada del volumen total o la variabilidad limitada del precio máximo.VWAP",
                "Esta flexibilidad de enfoque se deriva del hecho de que el \"VWAP\" es una cantidad en la que tanto los precios como los volúmenes son importantes, en oposición a OWT.2.3 RELACIONADOS Los algoritmos de \"VWAP\" que hemos discutido hasta ahora hemos discutido hasta ahora utilizan algún uso de los datos diarios (PT, VT) a medida que se desarrolla, utilizando la información de precio o volumen.VWAP",
                "Por el contrario, un algoritmo fijo de programación \"VWAP\" tiene una distribución predeterminada {F1, F2 ,...ft}, y simplemente vende acciones FTN en el tiempo T, independientemente de (PT, VT).VWAP",
                "Los algoritmos de \"VWAP\" fijo, o ligeras variantes de ellos, son sorprendentemente comunes en Wall Street, y el horario generalmente se deriva de datos históricos de volumen intradía.VWAP",

                "Hasta ahora, nuestro énfasis ha estado en los algoritmos \"VWAP\" que deben vender exactamente n acciones.VWAP",
                "Por ejemplo, esto es cierto en grandes casas de bolsa, donde muchas operaciones separadas de \"VWAP\" pueden ser agrupadas y ejecutadas por un algoritmo común, y la empresa estaría dispuesta a llevar una pequeña posición de acciones no vendidas durante la noche si resultó en mejores precios de ejecución.VWAP",
                "Establece que si estamos dispuestos a dejar que el número de acciones vendidas varíe con Q, de hecho podemos lograr una relación competitiva \"VWAP\" de 1. VWAP",
                "En el entorno \"VWAP\", la venta de acciones es un problema de beneficios, y comprar acciones es un problema de costo.VWAP",
