INTRODUCTION When agents interact with one another, the value of their contribution is determined by what they can do with their skills and resources, rather than simply their identities. Consider the problem of forming a soccer team. For a team to be successful, a team needs some forwards, midfielders, defenders, and a goalkeeper. The relevant attributes of the players are their skills at playing each of the four positions. The value of a team depends on how well its players can play these positions. At a finer level, we can extend the model to consider a wider range of skills, such as passing, shooting, and tackling, but the value of a team remains solely a function of the attributes of its players. Consider an example from the business world. Companies in the metals industry are usually vertically-integrated and diversified. They have mines for various types of ores, and also mills capable of processing and producing different kinds of metal. They optimize their production profile according to the market prices for their products. For example, when the price of aluminum goes up, they will allocate more resources to producing aluminum. However, each company is limited by the amount of ores it has, and its capacities in processing given kinds of ores. Two or more companies may benefit from trading ores and processing capacities with one another. To model the metal industry, the relevant attributes are the amount of ores and the processing capacities of the companies. Given the exogenous input of market prices, the value of a group of companies will be determined by these attributes. Many real-world problems can be likewise modeled by picking the right attributes. As attributes apply to both individual agents and groups of agents, we propose the use of coalitional game theory to understand what groups may form and what payoffs the agents may expect in such models. Coalitional game theory focuses on what groups of agents can achieve, and thus connects strongly with e-commerce, as the Internet economies have significantly enhanced the abilities of business to identify and capitalize on profitable opportunities of cooperation. Our goal is to understand the computational aspects of computing the solution concepts (stable and/or fair distribution of payoffs, formally defined in Section 3) for coalitional games described using attributes. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: • We define a formal representation for coalitional games based on attributes, and relate this representation to others proposed in the literature. We show that when compared to other representations, there exists games for which a multi-attribute description can be exponentially more succinct, and for no game it is worse. • Given the generality of the model, positive results carry over to other representations. We discuss two positive results in the paper, one for the Shapley value and one for the core, and show how these imply related results in the literature. 170 • We study an approximation heuristic for the Shapley value when its exact values cannot be found efficiently. We provide an explicit bound on the maximum error of the estimate, and show that the bound is asymptotically tight. We also carry out experiments to evaluate how the heuristic performs on random instances.1 2. RELATED WORK Coalitional game theory has been well studied in economics [9, 10, 14]. A vast amount of literature have focused on defining and comparing solution concepts, and determining their existence and properties. The first algorithmic study of coalitional games, as far as we know, is performed by Deng and Papadimitriou in [5]. They consider coalitional games defined on graphs, where the players are the vertices and the value of coalition is determined by the sum of the weights of the edges spanned by these players. This can be efficiently modeled and generalized using attributes. As a formal representation, multi-attribute coalitional games is closely related to the multi-issue representation of Conitzer and Sandholm [3] and our work on marginal contribution networks [7]. Both of these representations are based on dividing a coalitional game into subgames (termed issues in [3] and rules in [7]), and aggregating the subgames via linear combination. The key difference in our work is the unrestricted aggregation of subgames: the aggregation could be via a polynomial function of the attributes, or even by treating the subgames as input to another computational problem such as a min-cost flow problem. The relationship of these models will be made clear after we define the multiattribute representation in Section 4. Another representation proposed in the literature is one specialized for superadditive games by Conitzer and Sandholm [2]. This representation is succinct, but to find the values of some coalitions may require solving an NP-hard problem. While it is possible for multi-attribute coalitional games to efficiently represent these games, it necessarily requires the solution to an NP-hard problem in order to find out the values of some coalitions. In this paper, we stay within the boundary of games that admits efficient algorithm for determining the value of coalitions. We will therefore not make further comparisons with [2]. The model of coalitional games with attributes has been considered in the works of Shehory and Kraus. They model the agents as possessing capabilities that indicates their proficiencies in different areas, and consider how to efficiently allocate tasks [12] and the dynamics of coalition formation [13]. Our work differs significantly as our focus is on reasoning about solution concepts. Our model also covers a wider scope as attributes generalize the notion of capabilities. Yokoo et al. have also considered a model of coalitional games where agents are modeled by sets of skills, and these skills in turn determine the value of coalitions [15]. There are two major differences between their work and ours. Firstly, Yokoo et al. assume that each skill is fundamentally different from another, hence no two agents may possess the same skill. Also, they focus on developing new solution concepts that are robust with respect to manipulation by agents. Our focus is on reasoning about traditional solution concepts. 1 We acknowledge that random instances may not be typical of what happens in practice, but given the generality of our model, it provides the most unbiased view. Our work is also related to the study of cooperative games with committee control [4]. In these games, there is usually an underlying set of resources each controlled by a (possibly overlapping) set of players known as the committee, engaged in a simple game (defined in Section 3). multiattribute coalitional games generalize these by considering relationship between the committee and the resources beyond simple games. We note that when restricted to simple games, we derive similar results to that in [4]. 3. PRELIMINARIES In this section, we will review the relevant concepts of coalitional game theory and its two most important solution concepts - the Shapley value and the core. We will then define the computational questions that will be studied in the second half of the paper. 3.1 Coalitional Games Throughout this paper, we assume that payoffs to groups of agents can be freely distributed among its members. This transferable utility assumption is commonly made in coalitional game theory. The canonical representation of a coalitional game with transferable utility is its characteristic form. Definition 1. A coalition game with transferable utility in characteristic form is denoted by the pair N, v , where • N is the set of agents; and • v : 2N → R is a function that maps each group of agents S ⊆ N to a real-valued payoff. A group of agents in a game is known as a coalition, and the entire set of agents is known as the grand coalition. An important class of coalitional games is the class of monotonic games. Definition 2. A coalitional game is monotonic if for all S ⊂ T ⊆ N, v(S) ≤ v(T). Another important class of coalitional games is the class of simple games. In a simple game, a coalition either wins, in which case it has a value of 1, or loses, in which case it has a value of 0. It is often used to model voting situations. Simple games are often assumed to be monotonic, i.e., if S wins, then for all T ⊇ S, T also wins. This coincides with the notion of using simple games as a model for voting. If a simple game is monotonic, then it is fully described by the set of minimal winning coalitions, i.e., coalitions S for which v(S) = 1 but for all coalitions T ⊂ S, v(T) = 0. An outcome in a coalitional game specifies the utilities the agents receive. A solution concept assigns to each coalitional game a set of reasonable outcomes. Different solution concepts attempt to capture in some way outcomes that are stable and/or fair. Two of the best known solution concepts are the Shapley value and the core. The Shapley value is a normative solution concept that prescribes a fair way to divide the gains from cooperation when the grand coalition is formed. The division of payoff to agent i is the average marginal contribution of agent i over all possible permutations of the agents. Formally, Definition 3. The Shapley value of agent i, φi(v), in game N, v is given by the following formula φi(v) = S⊆N\\{i} |S|!(|N| − |S| − 1)! |N|! (v(S ∪ {i}) − v(S)) 171 The core is a descriptive solution concept that focuses on outcomes that are stable. Stability under core means that no set of players can jointly deviate to improve their payoffs. Definition 4. An outcome x ∈ R|N| is in the core of the game N, v if for all S ⊆ N, i∈S xi ≥ v(S) Note that the core of a game may be empty, i.e., there may not exist any payoff vector that satisfies the stability requirement for the given game. 3.2 Computational Problems We will study the following three problems related to solution concepts in coalitional games. Problem 1. (Shapley Value) Given a description of the coalitional game and an agent i, compute the Shapley value of agent i. Problem 2. (Core Membership) Given a description of the coalitional game and a payoff vector x such that È i∈N xi = v(N), determine if È i∈S xi ≥ v(S) for all S ⊆ N. Problem 3. (Core Non-emptiness) Given a description of the coalitional game, determine if there exists any payoff vector x such that È i∈S xi ≥ V (S) for all S ⊆ N, andÈ i∈N xi = v(N). Note that the complexity of the above problems depends on the how the game is described. All these problems will be easy if the game is described by its characteristic form, but only so because the description takes space exponential in the number of agents, and hence simple brute-force approach takes time polynomial to the input description. To properly understand the computational complexity questions, we have to look at compact representation. 4. FORMAL MODEL In this section, we will give a formal definition of multiattribute coalitional games, and show how it is related to some of the representations discussed in the literature. We will also discuss some limitations to our proposed approach. 4.1 Multi-Attribute Coalitional Games A multi-attribute coalitional game (MACG) consists of two parts: a description of the attributes of the agents, which we termed an attribute model, and a function that assigns values to combination of attributes. Together, they induce a coalitional game over the agents. We first define the attribute model. Definition 5. An attribute model is a tuple N, M, A , where • N denotes the set of agents, of size n; • M denotes the set of attributes, of size m; • A ∈ Rm×n , the attribute matrix, describes the values of the attributes of the agents, with Aij denoting the value of attribute i for agent j. We can directly define a function that maps combinations of attributes to real values. However, for many problems, we can describe the function more compactly by computing it in two steps: we first compute an aggregate value for each attribute, then compute the values of combination of attributes using only the aggregated information. Formally, Definition 6. An aggregating function (or aggregator) takes as input a row of the attribute matrix and a coalition S, and summarizes the attributes of the agents in S with a single number. We can treat it as a mapping from Rn × 2N → R. Aggregators often perform basic arithmetic or logical operations. For example, it may compute the sum of the attributes, or evaluate a Boolean expression by treating the agents i ∈ S as true and j /∈ S as false. Analogous to the notion of simple games, we call an aggregator simple if its range is {0, 1}. For any aggregator, there is a set of relevant agents, and a set of irrelevant agents. An agent i is irrelevant to aggregator aj if aj (S ∪ {i}) = aj (S) for all S ⊆ N. A relevant agent is one not irrelevant. Given the attribute matrix, an aggregator assigns a value to each coalition S ⊆ N. Thus, each aggregator defines a game over N. For aggregator aj , we refer to this induced game as the game of attribute j, and denote it with aj (A). When the attribute matrix is clear from the context, we may drop A and simply denote the game as aj . We may refer to the game as the aggregator when no ambiguities arise. We now define the second step of the computation with the help of aggregators. Definition 7. An aggregate value function takes as input the values of the aggregators and maps these to a real value. In this paper, we will focus on having one aggregator per attribute. Therefore, in what follows, we will refer to the aggregate value function as a function over the attributes. Note that when all aggregators are simple, the aggregate value function implicitly defines a game over the attributes, as it assigns a value to each set of attributes T ⊆ M. We refer to this as the game among attributes. We now define multi-attribute coalitional game. Definition 8. A multi-attribute coalitional game is defined by the tuple N, M, A, a, w , where • N, M, A is an attribute model; • a is a set of aggregators, one for each attribute; we can treat the set together as a vector function, mapping Rm×n × 2N → Rm • w : Rm → R is an aggregate value function. This induces a coalitional game with transferable payoffs N, v with players N and the value function defined by v(S) = w(a(A, S)) Note that MACG as defined is fully capable of representing any coalitional game N, v . We can simply take the set of attributes as equal to the set of agents, i.e., M = N, an identity matrix for A, aggregators of sums, and the aggregate value function w to be v. 172 4.2 An Example Let us illustrate how MACG can be used to represent a game with a simple example. Suppose there are four types of resources in the world: gold, silver, copper, and iron, that each agent is endowed with some amount of these resources, and there is a fixed price for each of the resources in the market. This game can be described using MACG with an attribute matrix A, where Aij denote the amount of resource i that agent j is endowed. For each resource, the aggregator sums together the amount of resources the agents have. Finally, the aggregate value function takes the dot product between the market price vector and the aggregate vector. Note the inherent flexibility in the model: only limited work would be required to update the game as the market price changes, or when a new agent arrives. 4.3 Relationship with Other Representations As briefly discussed in Section 2, MACG is closely related to two other representations in the literature, the multiissue representation of Conitzer and Sandholm [3], and our work on marginal contribution nets [7]. To make their relationships clear, we first review these two representations. We have changed the notations from the original papers to highlight their similarities. Definition 9. A multi-issue representation is given as a vector of coalitional games, (v1, v2, . . . vm), each possibly with a varying set of agents, say N1, . . . , Nm. The coalitional game N, v induced by multi-issue representation has player set N = Ëm i=1 Ni, and for each coalition S ⊆ N, v(S) = Èm i=1 v(S ∩ Ni). The games vi are assumed to be represented in characteristic form. Definition 10. A marginal contribution net is given as a set of rules (r1, r2, . . . , rm), where rule ri has a weight wi, and a pattern pi that is a conjunction over literals (positive or negative). The agents are represented as literals. A coalition S is said to satisfy the pattern pi, if we treat the agents i ∈ S as true, an agent j /∈ S as false, pi(S) evaluates to true. Denote the set of literals involved in rule i by Ni. The coalitional game N, v induced by a marginal contribution net has player set N = Ëm i=1 Ni, and for each coalition S ⊆ N, v(S) = È i:pi(S)=true wi. From these definitions, we can see the relationships among these three representations clearly. An issue of a multi-issue representation corresponds to an attribute in MACG. Similarly, a rule of a marginal contribution net corresponds to an attribute in MACG. The aggregate value functions are simple sums and weighted sums for the respective representations. Therefore, it is clear that MACG will be no less succinct than either representation. However, MACG differs in two important way. Firstly, there is no restriction on the operations performed by the aggregate value function over the attributes. This is an important generalization over the linear combination of issues or rules in the other two approaches. In particular, there are games for which MACG can be exponentially more compact. The proof of the following proposition can be found in the Appendix. Proposition 1. Consider the parity game N, v where coalition S ⊆ N has value v(S) = 1 if |S| is odd, and v(S) = 0 otherwise. MACG can represent the game in O(n) space. Both multi-issue representation and marginal contribution nets requires O(2n ) space. A second important difference of MACG is that the attribute model and the value function is cleanly separated. As suggested in the example in Section 4.2, this often allows us more efficient update of the values of the game as it changes. Also, the same attribute model can be evaluated using different value functions, and the same value function can be used to evaluate different attribute model. Therefore, MACG is very suitable for representing multiple games. We believe the problems of updating games and representing multiple games are interesting future directions to explore. 4.4 Limitation of One Aggregator per Attribute Before focusing on one aggregator per attribute for the rest of the paper, it is natural to wonder if any is lost per such restriction. The unfortunate answer is yes, best illustrated by the following. Consider again the problem of forming a soccer team discussed in the introduction, where we model the attributes of the agents as their ability to take the four positions of the field, and the value of a team depends on the positions covered. If we first aggregate each of the attribute individually, we will lose the distributional information of the attributes. In other words, we will not be able to distinguish between two teams, one of which has a player for each position, the other has one player who can play all positions, but the rest can only play the same one position. This loss of distributional information can be recovered by using aggregators that take as input multiple rows of the attribute matrix rather than just a single row. Alternatively, if we leave such attributes untouched, we can leave the burden of correctly evaluating these attributes to the aggregate value function. However, for many problems that we found in the literature, such as the transportation domain of [12] and the flow game setting of [4], the distribution of attributes does not affect the value of the coalitions. In addition, the problem may become unmanageably complex as we introduce more complicated aggregators. Therefore, we will focus on the representation as defined in Definition 8. 5. SHAPLEY VALUE In this section, we focus on computational issues of finding the Shapley value of a player in MACG. We first set up the problem with the use of oracles to avoid complexities arising from the aggregators. We then show that when attributes are linearly separable, the Shapley value can be efficiently computed. This generalizes the proofs of related results in the literature. For the non-linearly separable case, we consider a natural heuristic for estimating the Shapley value, and study the heuristic theoretically and empirically. 5.1 Problem Setup We start by noting that computing the Shapley value for simple aggregators can be hard in general. In particular, we can define aggregators to compute weighted majority over its input set of agents. As noted in [6], finding the Shapley value of a weighted majority game is #P-hard. Therefore, discussion of complexity of Shapley value for MACG with unrestricted aggregators is moot. Instead of placing explicit restriction on the aggregator, we assume that the Shapley value of the aggregator can be 173 answered by an oracle. For notation, let φi(u) denote the Shapley value for some game u. We make the following assumption: Assumption 1. For each aggregator aj in a MACG, there is an associated oracle that answers the Shapley value of the game of attribute j. In other words, φi(aj ) is known. For many aggregators that perform basic operations over its input, polynomial time oracle for Shapley value exists. This include operations such as sum, and symmetric functions when the attributes are restricted to {0, 1}. Also, when only few agents have an effect on the aggregator, brute-force computation for Shapley value is feasible. Therefore, the above assumption is reasonable for many settings. In any case, such abstraction allows us to focus on the aggregate value function. 5.2 Linearly Separable Attributes When the aggregate value function can be written as a linear function of the attributes, the Shapley value of the game can be efficiently computed. Theorem 1. Given a game N, v represented as a MACG N, M, A, a, w , if the aggregate value function can be written as a linear function of its attributes, i.e., w(a(A, S)) = m j=1 cj aj (A, S) The Shapley value of agent i in N, v is given by φi(v) = m j=1 cj φi(aj ) (1) Proof. First, we note that Shapley value satisfies an additivity axiom [11]. The Shapley value satisfies additivity, namely, φi(a + b) = φi(a) + φi(b), where N, a + b is a game defined to be (a + b)(S) = a(S) + b(S) for all S ⊆ N. It is also clear that Shapley value satisfies scaling, namely φi(αv) = αφi(v) where (αv)(S) = αv(S) for all S ⊆ N. Since the aggregate value function can be expressed as a weighted sum of games of attributes, φi(v) = φi(w(a)) = φi( m j=1 cjaj ) = m j=1 cjφi(aj ) Many positive results regarding efficient computation of Shapley value in the literature depends on some form of linearity. Examples include the edge-spanning game on graphs by Deng and Papadimitriou [5], the multi-issue representation of [3], and the marginal contribution nets of [7]. The key to determine if the Shapley value can be efficiently computed depends on the linear separability of attributes. Once this is satisfied, as long as the Shapley value of the game of attributes can be efficiently determined, the Shapley value of the entire game can be efficiently computed. Corollary 1. The Shapley value for the edge-spanning game of [5], games in multi-issue representation [3], and games in marginal contribution nets [7], can be computed in polynomial time. 5.3 Polynomial Combination of Attributes When the aggregate value function cannot be expressed as a linear function of its attributes, computing the Shapley value exactly is difficult. Here, we will focus on aggregate value function that can be expressed as some polynomial of its attributes. If we do not place a limit on the degree of the polynomial, and the game N, v is not necessarily monotonic, the problem is #P-hard. Theorem 2. Computing the Shapley value of a MACG N, M, A, a, w , when w can be an arbitrary polynomial of the aggregates a, is #P-hard, even when the Shapley value of each aggregator can be efficiently computed. The proof is via reduction from three-dimensional matching, and details can be found in the Appendix. Even if we restrict ourselves to monotonic games, and non-negative coefficients for the polynomial aggregate value function, computing the exact Shapley value can still be hard. For example, suppose there are two attributes. All agents in some set B ⊆ N possess the first attribute, and all agents in some set C ⊆ N possess the second, and B and C are disjoint. For a coalition S ⊆ N, the aggregator for the first evaluates to 1 if and only if |S ∩ B| ≥ b , and similarly, the aggregator for the second evaluates to 1 if and only if |S ∩ C| ≥ c . Let the cardinality of the sets B and C be b and c. We can verify that the Shapley value of an agent i in B equals φi = 1 b b −1 i=0  b i ¡  c c −1 ¡   b+c c +i−1 ¡ c − c + 1 b + c − c − i + 1 The equation corresponds to a weighted sum of probability values of hypergeometric random variables. The correspondence with hypergeometric distribution is due to sampling without replacement nature of Shapley value. As far as we know, there is no close-form formula to evaluate the sum above. In addition, as the number of attributes involved increases, we move to multi-variate hypergeometric random variables, and the number of summands grow exponentially in the number of attributes. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the exact Shapley value can be determined efficiently. Therefore, we look for approximation. 5.3.1 Approximation First, we need a criteria for evaluating how well an estimate, ˆφ, approximates the true Shapley value, φ. We consider the following three natural criteria: • Maximum underestimate: maxi φi/ˆφi • Maximum overestimate: maxi ˆφi/φi • Total variation: 1 2 È i |φi − ˆφi|, or alternatively maxS | È i∈S φi − È i∈S ˆφi| The total variation criterion is more meaningful when we normalize the game to having a value of 1 for the grand coalition, i.e., v(N) = 1. We can also define additive analogues of the under- and overestimates, especially when the games are normalized. 174 We will assume for now that the aggregate value function is a polynomial over the attributes with non-negative coefficients. We will also assume that the aggregators are simple. We will evaluate a specific heuristic that is analogous to Equation (1). Suppose the aggregate function can be written as a polynomial with p terms w(a(A, S)) = p j=1 cj aj(1) (A, S)aj(2) (A, S) · · · aj(kj ) (A, S) (2) For term j, the coefficient of the term is cj , its degree kj , and the attributes involved in the term are j(1), . . . , j(kj ). We compute an estimate ˆφ to the Shapley value as ˆφi = p j=1 kj l=1 cj kj φi(aj(l) ) (3) The idea behind the estimate is that for each term, we divide the value of the term equally among all its attributes. This is represented by the factor cj kj . Then for for each attribute of an agent, we assign the player a share of value from the attribute. This share is determined by the Shapley value of the simple game of that attribute. Without considering the details of the simple games, this constitutes a fair (but blind) rule of sharing. 5.3.2 Theoretical analysis of heuristic We can derive a simple and tight bound for the maximum (multiplicative) underestimate of the heuristic estimate. Theorem 3. Given a game N, v represented as a MACG N, M, A, a, w , suppose w can be expressed as a polynomial function of its attributes (cf Equation (2)). Let K = maxjkj, i.e., the maximum degree of the polynomial. Let ˆφ denote the estimated Shapley value using Equation (3), and φ denote the true Shapley value. For all i ∈ N, φi ≥ K ˆφi. Proof. We bound the maximum underestimate term-byterm. Let tj be the j-th term of the polynomial. We note that the term can be treated as a game among attributes, as it assigns a value to each coalition S ⊆ N. Without loss of generality, renumber attributes j(1) through j(kj ) as 1 through kj. tj (S) = cj kj l=1 al (A, S) To make the equations less cluttered, let B(N, S) = |S|!(|N| − |S| − 1)! |N|! and for a game a, contribution of agent i to group S : i /∈ S, ∆i(a, S) = a(S ∪ {i}) − a(S) The true Shapley value of the game tj is φi(tj) = cj S⊆N\\{i} B(N, S)∆i(tj, S) For each coalition S, i /∈ S, ∆i(tj , S) = 1 if and only if for at least one attribute, say l∗ , ∆i(al∗ , S) = 1. Therefore, if we sum over all the attributes, we would have included l∗ for sure. φi(tj) ≤ cj kj j=1 S⊆N\\{i} B(N, S)∆i(aj , S) = kj kj j=1 cj kj φi(aj ) = kj ˆφi(T) Summing over the terms, we see that the worst case underestimate is by the maximum degree. Without loss of generality, since the bound is multiplicative, we can normalize the game to having v(N) = 1. As a corollary, because we cannot overestimate any set by more than K times, we obtain a bound on the total variation: Corollary 2. The total variation between the estimated Shapley value and the true Shapley value, for K-degree bounded polynomial aggregate value function, is K−1 K . We can show that this bound is tight. Example 1. Consider a game with n players and K attributes. Let the first (n−1) agents be a member of the first (K − 1) attributes, and that the corresponding aggregator returns 1 if any one of the first (K − 1) agents is present. Let the n-th agent be the sole member of the K-th attribute. The estimated Shapley will assign a value of K−1 K 1 n−1 to the first (n − 1) agents and 1 K to the n-th agent. However, the true Shapley value of the n-th agent tends to 1 as n → ∞, and the total variation approaches K−1 K . In general, we cannot bound how much ˆφ may overestimate the true Shapley value. The problem is that ˆφi may be non-zero for agent i even though may have no influence over the outcome of a game when attributes are multiplied together, as illustrated by the following example. Example 2. Consider a game with 2 players and 2 attributes, and let the first agent be a member of both attributes, and the other agent a member of the second attribute. For a coalition S, the first aggregator evaluates to 1 if agent 1 ∈ S, and the second aggregator evaluates to 1 if both agents are in S. While agent 2 is not a dummy with respect to the second attribute, it is a dummy with respect to the product of the attributes. Agent 2 will be assigned a value of 1 4 by the estimate. As mentioned, for simple monotonic games, a game is fully described by its set of minimal winning coalitions. When the simple aggregators are represented as such, it is possible to check, in polynomial time, for agents turning dummies after attributes are multiplied together. Therefore, we can improve the heuristic estimate in this special case. 5.3.3 Empirical evaluation Due to a lack of benchmark problems for coalitional games, we have tested the heuristic on random instances. We believe more meaningful results can be obtained when we have real instances to test this heuristic on. Our experiment is set up as follows. We control three parameters of the experiment: the number of players (6 − 10), 175 0 0.025 0.05 0.075 0.1 0.125 0.15 0.175 0.2 6 7 8 9 10 No. of Players TotalVariationDistance 2 3 4 5 (a) Effect of Max Degree 0 0.025 0.05 0.075 0.1 0.125 0.15 0.175 0.2 6 7 8 9 10 No. of Players TotalVariationDistance 4 5 6 (b) Effect of Number of Attributes Figure 1: Experimental results the number of attributes (3 − 8), and the maximum degree of the polynomial (2 − 5). For each attribute, we randomly sample one to three minimal winning coalitions. We then randomly generate a polynomial of the desired maximum degree with a random number (3 − 12) of terms, each with a random positive weight. We normalize each game to have v(N) = 1. The results of the experiments are shown in Figure 1. The y-axis of the graphs shows the total variation, and the x-axis the number of players. Each datapoint is an average of approximately 700 random samples. Figure 1(a) explores the effect of the maximum degree and the number of players when the number of attributes is fixed (at six). As expected, the total variation increases as the maximum degree increases. On the other hand, there is only a very small increase in error as the number of players increases. The error is nowhere near the theoretical worstcase bound of 1 2 to 4 5 for polynomials of degrees 2 to 5. Figure 1(b) explores the effect of the number of attributes and the number of players when the maximum degree of the polynomial is fixed (at three). We first note that these three lines are quite tightly clustered together, suggesting that the number of attributes has relatively little effect on the error of the estimate. As the number of attributes increases, the total variation decreases. We think this is an interesting phenomenon. This is probably due to the precise construct required for the worst-case bound, and so as more attributes are available, we have more diverse terms in the polynomial, and the diversity pushes away from the worst-case bound. 6. CORE-RELATED QUESTIONS In this section, we look at the complexity of the two computational problems related to the core: Core Nonemptiness and Core Membership. We show that the nonemptiness of core of the game among attributes and the cores of the aggregators imply non-emptiness of the core of the game induced by the MACG. We also show that there appears to be no such general relationship that relates the core memberships of the game among attributes, games of attributes, and game induced by MACG. 6.1 Problem Setup There are many problems in the literature for which the questions of Core Non-emptiness and Core Membership are known to be hard [1]. For example, for the edgespanning game that Deng and Papadimitriou studied [5], both of these questions are coNP-complete. As MACG can model the edge-spanning game in the same amount of space, these hardness results hold for MACG as well. As in the case for computing Shapley value, we attempt to find a way around the hardness barrier by assuming the existence of oracles, and try to build algorithms with these oracles. First, we consider the aggregate value function. Assumption 2. For a MACG N, M, A, a, w , we assume there are oracles that answers the questions of Core Nonemptiness, and Core Membership for the aggregate value function w. When the aggregate value function is a non-negative linear function of its attributes, the core is always non-empty, and core membership can be determined efficiently. The concept of core for the game among attributes makes the most sense when the aggregators are simple games. We will further assume that these simple games are monotonic. Assumption 3. For a MACG N, M, A, a, w , we assume all aggregators are monotonic and simple. We also assume there are oracles that answers the questions of Core Nonemptiness, and Core Membership for the aggregators. We consider this a mild assumption. Recall that monotonic simple games are fully described by their set of minimal winning coalitions (cf Section 3). If the aggregators are represented as such, Core Non-emptiness and Core Membership can be checked in polynomial time. This is due to the following well-known result regarding simple games: Lemma 1. A simple game N, v has a non-empty core if and only if it has a set of veto players, say V , such that v(S) = 0 for all S ⊇ V . Further, A payoff vector x is in the core if and only if xi = 0 for all i /∈ V . 6.2 Core Non-emptiness There is a strong connection between the non-emptiness of the cores of the games among attributes, games of the attributes, and the game induced by a MACG. Theorem 4. Given a game N, v represented as a MACG N, M, A, a, w , if the core of the game among attributes, 176 M, w , is non-empty, and the cores of the games of attributes are non-empty, then the core of N, v is non-empty. Proof. Let u be an arbitrary payoff vector in the core of the game among attributes, M, w . For each attribute j, let θj be an arbitrary payoff vector in the core of the game of attribute j. By Lemma 1, each attribute j must have a set of veto players; let this set be denoted by Pj . For each agent i ∈ N, let yi = È j ujθj i . We claim that this vector y is in the core of N, v . Consider any coalition S ⊆ N, v(S) = w(a(A, S)) ≤ j:S⊇P j uj (4) This is true because an aggregator cannot evaluate to 1 without all members of the veto set. For any attribute j, by Lemma 1, È i∈P j θj i = 1. Therefore, j:S⊇P j uj = j:S⊇P j uj i∈P j θj i = i∈S j:S⊇P j ujθj i ≤ i∈S yi Note that the proof is constructive, and hence if we are given an element in the core of the game among attributes, we can construct an element of the core of the coalitional game. From Theorem 4, we can obtain the following corollaries that have been previously shown in the literature. Corollary 3. The core of the edge-spanning game of [5] is non-empty when the edge weights are non-negative. Proof. Let the players be the vertices, and their attributes the edges incident on them. For each attribute, there is a veto set - namely, both endpoints of the edges. As previously observed, an aggregate value function that is a non-negative linear function of its aggregates has non-empty core. Therefore, the precondition of Theorem 4 is satisfied, and the edge-spanning game with non-negative edge weights has a non-empty core. Corollary 4 (Theorem 1 of [4]). The core of a flow game with committee control, where each edge is controlled by a simple game with a veto set of players, is non-empty. Proof. We treat each edge of the flow game as an attribute, and so each attribute has a veto set of players. The core of a flow game (without committee) has been shown to be non-empty in [8]. We can again invoke Theorem 4 to show the non-emptiness of core for flow games with committee control. However, the core of the game induced by a MACG may be non-empty even when the core of the game among attributes is empty, as illustrated by the following example. Example 3. Suppose the minimal winning coalition of all aggregators in a MACG N, M, A, a, w is N, then v(S) = 0 for all coalitions S ⊂ N. As long as v(N) ≥ 0, any nonnegative vector x that satisfies È i∈N xi = v(N) is in the core of N, v . Complementary to the example above, when all the aggregators have empty cores, the core of N, v is also empty. Theorem 5. Given a game N, v represented as a MACG N, M, A, a, w , if the cores of all aggregators are empty, v(N) > 0, and for each i ∈ N, v({i}) ≥ 0, then the core of N, v is empty. Proof. Suppose the core of N, v is non-empty. Let x be a member of the core, and pick an agent i such that xi > 0. However, for each attribute, since the core is empty, by Lemma 1, there are at least two disjoint winning coalitions. Pick the winning coalition Sj that does not include i for each attribute j. Let S∗ = Ë j Sj . Because S∗ is winning for all coalitions, v(S∗ ) = v(N). However, v(N) = j∈N xj = xi + j /∈N xj ≥ xi + j∈S∗ xj > j∈S∗ xj Therefore, v(S∗ ) > È j∈S∗ xj, contradicting the fact that x is in the core of N, v . We do not have general results regarding the problem of Core Non-emptiness when some of the aggregators have non-empty cores while others have empty cores. We suspect knowledge about the status of the cores of the aggregators alone is insufficient to decide this problem. 6.3 Core Membership Since it is possible for the game induced by the MACG to have a non-empty core when the core of the aggregate value function is empty (Example 3), we try to explore the problem of Core Membership assuming that the core of both the game among attributes, M, w , and the underlying game, N, v , is known to be non-empty, and see if there is any relationship between their members. One reasonable requirement is whether a payoff vector x in the core of N, v can be decomposed and re-aggregated to a payoff vector y in the core of M, w . Formally, Definition 11. We say that a vector x ∈ Rn ≥0 can be decomposed and re-aggregated into a vector y ∈ Rm ≥0 if there exists Z ∈ Rm×n ≥0 , such that yi = n j=1 Zij for all i xj = m i=1 Zij for all j We may refer Z as shares. When there is no restriction on the entries of Z, it is always possible to decompose a payoff vector x in the core of N, v to a payoff vector y in the core of M, w . However, it seems reasonable to restrict that if an agent j is irrelevant to the aggregator i, i.e., i never changes the outcome of aggregator j, then Zij should be restricted to be 0. Unfortunately, this restriction is already too strong. Example 4. Consider a MACG N, M, A, a, w with two players and three attributes. Suppose agent 1 is irrelevant to attribute 1, and agent 2 is irrelevant to attributes 2 and 3. For any set of attributes T ⊆ M, let w be defined as w(T) = 0 if |T| = 0 or 1 6 if |T| = 2 10 if |T| = 3 177 Since the core of a game with a finite number of players forms a polytope, we can verify that the set of vectors (4, 4, 2), (4, 2, 4), and (2, 4, 4), fully characterize the core C of M, w . On the other hand, the vector (10, 0) is in the core of N, v . This vector cannot be decomposed and re-aggregated to a vector in C under the stated restriction. Because of the apparent lack of relationship among members of the core of N, v and that of M, w , we believe an algorithm for testing Core Membership will require more input than just the veto sets of the aggregators and the oracle of Core Membership for the aggregate value function. 7. CONCLUDING REMARKS Multi-attribute coalitional games constitute a very natural way of modeling problems of interest. Its space requirement compares favorably with other representations discussed in the literature, and hence it serves well as a prototype to study computational complexity of coalitional game theory for a variety of problems. Positive results obtained under this representation can easily be translated to results about other representations. Some of these corollary results have been discussed in Sections 5 and 6. An important direction to explore in the future is the question of efficiency in updating a game, and how to evaluate the solution concepts without starting from scratch. As pointed out at the end of Section 4.3, MACG is very naturally suited for updates. Representation results regarding efficiency of updates, and algorithmic results regarding how to compute the different solution concepts from updates, will both be very interesting. Our work on approximating the Shapley value when the aggregate value function is a non-linear function of the attributes suggests more work to be done there as well. Given the natural probabilistic interpretation of the Shapley value, we believe that a random sampling approach may have significantly better theoretical guarantees. 8. REFERENCES [1] J. M.

To prove Proposition 1, we need the following lemma. Lemma 2. Marginal contribution nets when all coalitions are restricted to have values 0 or 1 have the same representation power as an AND/OR circuit with negation at the literal level (i.e., AC0 circuit) of depth two. Proof. If a rule assigns a negative value in the marginal contribution nets, we can write the rule by a corresponding set of at most n rules, where n is the number of agents, such that each of which has positive values through application of De Morgans Law. With all values of the rules non-negative, we can treat the weighted summation step of marginal contribution nets can be viewed as an OR, and each rule as a conjunction over literals, possibly negated. This exactly match up with an AND/OR circuit of depth two. Proof (Proposition 1). The parity game can be represented with a MACG using a single attribute, aggregator of sum, and an aggregate value function that evaluates that sum modulus two. As a Boolean function, parity is known to require an exponential number of prime implicants. By Lemma 2, a prime implicant is the exact analogue of a pattern in a rule of marginal contribution nets. Therefore, to represent the parity function, a marginal contribution nets must be an exponential number of rules. Finally, as shown in [7], a marginal contribution net is at worst a factor of O(n) less compact than multi-issue representation. Therefore, multi-issue representation will also 178 take exponential space to represent the parity game. This is assuming that each issue in the game is represented in characteristic form. Proof (Theorem 2). An instance of three-dimensional matching is as follows [6]: Given set P ⊆ W × X × Y , where W , X, Y are disjoint sets having the same number q of elements, does there exist a matching P ⊆ P such that |P | = q and no two elements of P agree in any coordinate. For notation, let P = {p1, p2, . . . , pK}. We construct a MACG N, M, A, a, w as follows: • M: Let attributes 1 to q correspond to elements in W , (q+1) to 2q correspond to elements in X, (2q+1) to 3q corresponds to element in Y , and let there be a special attribute (3q + 1). • N: Let player i corresponds to pi, and let there be a special player . • A: Let Aji = 1 if the element corresponding to attribute j is in pi. Thus, for the first K columns, there are exactly three non-zero entries. We also set A(3q+1) = 1. • a: for each aggregator j, aj (A(S)) = 1 if and only if sum of row j of A(S) equals 1. • w: product over all aj . In the game N, v that corresponds to this construction, v(S) = 1 if and only if all attributes are covered exactly once. Therefore, for /∈ T ⊆ N, v(T ∪ { }) − v(T) = 1 if and only if T covers attributes 1 to 3q exactly once. Since all such T, if exists, must be of size q, the number of threedimensional matchings is given by φ (v) (K + 1)! q!(K − q)! 179",

Introducción Cuando los agentes interactúan entre sí, el valor de su contribución está determinado por lo que pueden hacer con sus habilidades y recursos, en lugar de simplemente sus identidades. Considere el problema de formar un equipo de fútbol. Para que un equipo tenga éxito, un equipo necesita algunos delanteros, centrocampistas, defensores y un portero. Los atributos relevantes de los jugadores son sus habilidades para jugar cada una de las cuatro posiciones. El valor de un equipo depende de qué tan bien sus jugadores puedan jugar estas posiciones. En un nivel más fino, podemos extender el modelo para considerar una gama más amplia de habilidades, como pasar, disparar y abordar, pero el valor de un equipo sigue siendo únicamente una función de los atributos de sus jugadores. Considere un ejemplo del mundo de los negocios. Las empresas en la industria de los metales suelen estar integradas y diversificadas verticalmente. Tienen minas para varios tipos de minerales, y también fábricas capaces de procesar y producir diferentes tipos de metal. Optimizan su perfil de producción de acuerdo con los precios del mercado de sus productos. Por ejemplo, cuando el precio del aluminio sube, asignarán más recursos para producir aluminio. Sin embargo, cada compañía está limitada por la cantidad de minerales que tiene y sus capacidades en el procesamiento dados de minerales. Dos o más empresas pueden beneficiarse del comercio de minerales y capacidades de procesamiento entre sí. Para modelar la industria del metal, los atributos relevantes son la cantidad de minerales y las capacidades de procesamiento de las empresas. Dado el aporte exógeno de los precios del mercado, estos atributos determinarán el valor de un grupo de empresas. Muchos problemas del mundo real también pueden modelarse eligiendo los atributos correctos. A medida que los atributos se aplican tanto a los agentes individuales como a los grupos de agentes, proponemos el uso de la teoría de juegos coalición para comprender qué grupos pueden formar y qué pagos pueden esperar en tales modelos. La teoría del juego coalición se centra en lo que pueden lograr los grupos de agentes y, por lo tanto, se conecta fuertemente con el comercio electrónico, ya que las economías de Internet han mejorado significativamente las habilidades de los negocios para identificar y capitalizar las oportunidades rentables de cooperación. Nuestro objetivo es comprender los aspectos computacionales de calcular los conceptos de solución (distribución estable y/o justa de los pagos, definidos formalmente en la Sección 3) para los juegos de coalición descritos utilizando atributos. Nuestras contribuciones se pueden resumir de la siguiente manera: • Definimos una representación formal para los juegos de coalición basado en atributos, y relacionamos esta representación con otros propuestos en la literatura. Mostramos que, en comparación con otras representaciones, existen juegos para los cuales una descripción de atributo múltiple puede ser exponencialmente más sucinto, y para ningún juego es peor.• Dada la generalidad del modelo, los resultados positivos se trasladan a otras representaciones. Discutimos dos resultados positivos en el documento, uno para el valor de Shapley y otro para el núcleo, y mostramos cómo estos implican resultados relacionados en la literatura.170 • Estudiamos una heurística de aproximación para el valor de Shapley cuando sus valores exactos no se pueden encontrar de manera eficiente. Proporcionamos un límite explícito en el error máximo de la estimación, y mostramos que el límite es asintóticamente apretado. También realizamos experimentos para evaluar cómo se desempeña la heurística en instancias aleatorias. 1 2. La teoría de juegos coalicionales de trabajo relacionado ha sido bien estudiada en economía [9, 10, 14]. Una gran cantidad de literatura se ha centrado en definir y comparar conceptos de solución, y determinar su existencia y propiedades. Deng y Papadimitriou realizan el primer estudio algorítmico de juegos coalicionales, hasta donde sabemos, en [5]. Consideran los juegos de coalición definidos en gráficos, donde los jugadores son los vértices y el valor de la coalición está determinado por la suma de los pesos de los bordes abarcados por estos jugadores. Esto puede modelarse y generalizarse de manera eficiente utilizando atributos. Como una representación formal, los juegos de coalición de múltiples atributos están estrechamente relacionados con la representación de múltiples problemas de Conitzer y Sandholm [3] y nuestro trabajo en redes de contribuciones marginales [7]. Ambas representaciones se basan en dividir un juego de coalición en subgamas (denominados problemas en [3] y reglas en [7]), y agregar los subgamas a través de la combinación lineal. La diferencia clave en nuestro trabajo es la agregación sin restricciones de los subgamas: la agregación podría ser a través de una función polinómica de los atributos, o incluso tratando los subgámetros como entrada a otro problema computacional, como un problema de flujo de costo mínimo. La relación de estos modelos se dejará clara después de definir la representación de títulos múltiples en la Sección 4. Otra representación propuesta en la literatura es una especializada para juegos superaditivos de Conitzer y Sandholm [2]. Esta representación es sucinta, pero encontrar los valores de algunas coaliciones puede requerir resolver un problema con np. Si bien es posible que los juegos de coalición de múltiples atributos representen de manera eficiente estos juegos, necesariamente requiere la solución a un problema difícil para descubrir los valores de algunas coaliciones. En este artículo, nos mantenemos dentro del límite de los juegos que admite un algoritmo eficiente para determinar el valor de las coaliciones. Por lo tanto, no haremos más comparaciones con [2]. El modelo de juegos de coalición con atributos se ha considerado en las obras de Shehory y Kraus. Modelan a los agentes como capacidades que poseen sus propiedades en diferentes áreas y consideran cómo asignar tareas de manera eficiente [12] y la dinámica de la formación de coaliciones [13]. Nuestro trabajo difiere significativamente ya que nuestro enfoque es razonar sobre los conceptos de solución. Nuestro modelo también cubre un alcance más amplio a medida que los atributos generalizan la noción de capacidades. Yokoo et al.También han considerado un modelo de juegos de coalición donde los agentes son modelados por conjuntos de habilidades, y estas habilidades a su vez determinan el valor de las coaliciones [15]. Hay dos diferencias principales entre su trabajo y el nuestro. En primer lugar, Yokoo et al.Suponga que cada habilidad es fundamentalmente diferente de otra, por lo tanto, no dos agentes pueden poseer la misma habilidad. Además, se centran en desarrollar nuevos conceptos de solución que son robustos con respecto a la manipulación por parte de los agentes. Nuestro enfoque está en el razonamiento sobre los conceptos de solución tradicionales.1 Reconocemos que las instancias aleatorias pueden no ser típicas de lo que sucede en la práctica, pero dada la generalidad de nuestro modelo, proporciona la visión más imparcial. Nuestro trabajo también está relacionado con el estudio de los juegos cooperativos con el control del comité [4]. En estos juegos, generalmente hay un conjunto subyacente de recursos, cada uno controlado por un conjunto de jugadores (posiblemente superpuestos) conocidos como Comité, involucrado en un juego simple (definido en la Sección 3).Los juegos de coalición múltiples generalizan estos al considerar la relación entre el comité y los recursos más allá de los juegos simples. Observamos que cuando se restringe a juegos simples, obtenemos resultados similares a los en [4].3. Preliminares En esta sección, revisaremos los conceptos relevantes de la teoría del juego de coalición y sus dos conceptos de solución más importantes: el valor de Shapley y el núcleo. Luego definiremos las preguntas computacionales que se estudiarán en la segunda mitad del documento.3.1 Juegos de coalición A lo largo de este documento, suponemos que los pagos a grupos de agentes se pueden distribuir libremente entre sus miembros. Esta suposición de utilidad transferible se realiza comúnmente en la teoría de juegos de coalición. La representación canónica de un juego de coalición con utilidad transferible es su forma característica. Definición 1. El par n, v denota un juego de coalición con utilidad transferible en forma característica, donde • n es el conjunto de agentes;y • V: 2n → R es una función que mapea a cada grupo de agentes s ⊆ n a una recompensa de valor real. Un grupo de agentes en un juego se conoce como coalición, y todo el conjunto de agentes se conoce como la Gran Coalición. Una clase importante de juegos de coalición es la clase de juegos monotónicos. Definición 2. Un juego de coalición es monotónico si para todos los s ⊂ t ⊆ n, v (s) ≤ v (t). Otra clase importante de juegos de coalición es la clase de juegos simples. En un juego simple, una coalición gana, en cuyo caso tiene un valor de 1, o pierde, en cuyo caso tiene un valor de 0. A menudo se usa para modelar situaciones de votación. A menudo se supone que los juegos simples son monotónicos, es decir, si S gana, entonces para todos los t ⊇ s, t también gana. Esto coincide con la noción de usar juegos simples como modelo para votar. Si un juego simple es monotónico, entonces se describe completamente por el conjunto de coaliciones ganadoras mínimas, es decir, coaliciones para las cuales v (s) = 1 pero para todas las coaliciones t ⊂ s, v (t) = 0. Un resultado en un juego de coalición especifica los servicios públicos que reciben los agentes. Un concepto de solución asigna a cada juego de coalición un conjunto de resultados razonables. Diferentes conceptos de solución intentan capturar de alguna manera resultados estables y/o justos. Dos de los conceptos de solución más conocidos son el valor de Shapley y el núcleo. El valor de Shapley es un concepto de solución normativa que prescribe una forma justa de dividir las ganancias de la cooperación cuando se forma la Gran Coalición. La División de Recompensa al Agente I es la contribución marginal promedio del agente I sobre todas las permutaciones posibles de los agentes. Formalmente, definición 3. El valor de Shapley del agente I, φi (v), en el juego n, V viene dado por la siguiente fórmula φi (v) = s⊆n \\ {i} | s |!(| N | - | s | - 1)!| N |!(V (S ∪ {i}) - V (s)) 171 El núcleo es un concepto de solución descriptivo que se centra en los resultados que son estables. La estabilidad bajo núcleo significa que ningún conjunto de jugadores puede desviarse conjuntamente para mejorar sus pagos. Definición 4. Un resultado x ∈ R | n |está en el núcleo del juego n, v si para todos s ⊆ n, i∈S xi ≥ v (s) tenga en cuenta que el núcleo de un juego puede estar vacío, es decir, puede que no haya ningún vector de pago que satisfaga la estabilidadrequisito para el juego dado.3.2 Problemas computacionales Estudiaremos los siguientes tres problemas relacionados con los conceptos de solución en los juegos de coalición. Problema 1. (Valor de Shapley) Dada una descripción del juego de coalición y un agente I, calcule el valor de Shapley del agente i. Problema 2. (Membresía central) Dada una descripción del juego de coalición y un vector de pago x tal que è i∈N xi = v (n), determine si è i∈S xi ≥ v (s) para todos s ⊆ N.Problema 3. (no vacío central) Dada una descripción del juego de coalición, determine si existe algún vector de pago x tal que è i∈S xi ≥ v (s) para todos s ⊆ n, yè i∈N xi = v (v)(NORTE). Tenga en cuenta que la complejidad de los problemas anteriores depende de cómo se describe el juego. Todos estos problemas serán fáciles si el juego se describe por su forma característica, pero solo así porque la descripción toma el espacio exponencial en el número de agentes y, por lo tanto, un enfoque simple de fuerza bruta lleva el tiempo polinomio a la descripción de la entrada. Para comprender adecuadamente las preguntas de complejidad computacional, tenemos que analizar la representación compacta.4. Modelo formal En esta sección, daremos una definición formal de juegos de coalición múltiple y mostraremos cómo está relacionado con algunas de las representaciones discutidas en la literatura. También discutiremos algunas limitaciones a nuestro enfoque propuesto.4.1 Juegos de coalición de múltiples atributos Un juego de coalición de atribución múltiple (MACG) consta de dos partes: una descripción de los atributos de los agentes, que llamamos un modelo de atributo, y una función que asigna valores a la combinación de atributos. Juntos, inducen un juego de coalición sobre los agentes. Primero definimos el modelo de atributo. Definición 5. Un modelo de atributo es una tupla n, m, a, donde • n denota el conjunto de agentes, de tamaño n;• M denota el conjunto de atributos, del tamaño M;• A ∈ Rm × N, la matriz de atributos, describe los valores de los atributos de los agentes, con AIJ que denota el valor del atributo I para el agente j. Podemos definir directamente una función que mapea combinaciones de atributos a valores reales. Sin embargo, para muchos problemas, podemos describir la función de manera más compacta calculándola en dos pasos: primero calculamos un valor agregado para cada atributo, luego calculamos los valores de combinación de atributos utilizando solo la información agregada. Formalmente, definición 6. Una función de agregación (o agregador) toma como entrada una fila de la matriz de atributos y una coalición S, y resume los atributos de los agentes en S con un solo número. Podemos tratarlo como un mapeo de RN × 2n → R. Los agregadores a menudo realizan operaciones aritméticas o lógicas básicas. Por ejemplo, puede calcular la suma de los atributos, o evaluar una expresión booleana tratando a los agentes i ∈ S como verdadero y j /∈ S como falso. Análogo a la noción de juegos simples, llamamos a un agregador simple si su rango es {0, 1}. Para cualquier agregador, hay un conjunto de agentes relevantes y un conjunto de agentes irrelevantes. Un agente I es irrelevante para el agregador AJ si AJ (S ∪ {i}) = aj (s) para todos S ⊆ N. Un agente relevante no es irrelevante. Dada la matriz de atributos, un agregador asigna un valor a cada coalición S ⊆ N. Por lo tanto, cada agregador define un juego sobre N. Para el agregador AJ, nos referimos a este juego inducido como el juego del atributo J, y lo denotamos con AJ ((A). Cuando la matriz de atributos está clara en el contexto, podemos soltar A y simplemente denotar el juego como AJ. Podemos referirnos al juego como el agregador cuando no surgen ambigüedades. Ahora definimos el segundo paso del cálculo con la ayuda de los agregadores. Definición 7. Una función de valor agregado toma como entrada los valores de los agregadores y los asigna a un valor real. En este artículo, nos centraremos en tener un agregador por atributo. Por lo tanto, en lo que sigue, nos referiremos a la función del valor agregado como una función sobre los atributos. Tenga en cuenta que cuando todos los agregadores son simples, la función de valor agregado define implícitamente un juego sobre los atributos, ya que asigna un valor a cada conjunto de atributos t ⊆ M. Nos referimos a esto como el juego entre los atributos. Ahora definimos un juego de coalición múltiple de atributo. Definición 8. Un juego de coalición de múltiples atributos está definido por la tupla n, m, a, a, w, donde • n, m, a es un modelo de atributo;• A es un conjunto de agregadores, uno para cada atributo;Podemos tratar el conjunto juntos como una función vectorial, mapeando RM × N × 2n → RM • W: RM → R es una función de valor agregado. Esto induce un juego de coalición con pagos transferibles n, v con jugadores n y la función de valor definida por v (s) = w (a (a, s)) Tenga en cuenta que macg tal como definido es totalmente capaz de representar cualquier juego de coalición n, v. Simplemente podemos tomar el conjunto de atributos como igual al conjunto de agentes, es decir, m = n, una matriz de identidad para a, agregadores de sumas y la función de valor agregado w como v. 172 4.2 Un ejemplo, ilustramos cómoMACG se puede usar para representar un juego con un ejemplo simple. Supongamos que hay cuatro tipos de recursos en el mundo: oro, plata, cobre y hierro, que cada agente está dotado de cierta cantidad de estos recursos, y hay un precio fijo para cada uno de los recursos en el mercado. Este juego se puede describir usando MACG con una matriz de atributo A, donde AIJ denota la cantidad de recurso I de que el Agente J está dotado. Para cada recurso, el agregador suma la cantidad de recursos que tienen los agentes. Finalmente, la función de valor agregado toma el producto DOT entre el vector de precios de mercado y el vector agregado. Tenga en cuenta la flexibilidad inherente en el modelo: solo se requeriría un trabajo limitado para actualizar el juego a medida que cambia el precio del mercado, o cuando llega un nuevo agente.4.3 Relación con otras representaciones Como se discutió brevemente en la Sección 2, MACG está estrechamente relacionada con otras dos representaciones en la literatura, la representación múltiple de Conitzer y Sandholm [3], y nuestro trabajo sobre redes de contribución marginal [7]. Para aclarar sus relaciones, primero revisamos estas dos representaciones. Hemos cambiado las anotaciones de los documentos originales para resaltar sus similitudes. Definición 9. Una representación de múltiples problemas se da como un vector de juegos de coalición (V1, V2, ... vm), cada uno posiblemente con un conjunto variable de agentes, digamos N1 ,..., Nm. El juego de coalición n, V inducido por representación de múltiples problemas tiene el jugador establecido n = ëm i = 1 ni, y para cada coalición S ⊆ n, V (s) = èm I = 1 V (S ∩ Ni). Se supone que los Juegos VI están representados en forma característica. Definición 10. Una red de contribución marginal se da como un conjunto de reglas (R1, R2, ..., RM), donde la regla RI tiene un peso WI y un patrón Pi que es una conjunción sobre literales (positivo o negativo). Los agentes están representados como literales. Se dice que una coalición s satisface el patrón Pi, si tratamos a los agentes i ∈ S como verdadero, un agente J /∈ S como falso, PI (s) evalúa como verdadero. Denota el conjunto de literales involucrados en la Regla I por NI. El juego de coalición n, v inducido por una red de contribución marginal tiene el jugador establecido n = ëm i = 1 ni, y para cada coalición s ⊆ n, v (s) = è i: pi (s) = verdadero wi. De estas definiciones, podemos ver claramente las relaciones entre estas tres representaciones. Un problema de una representación de múltiples problemas corresponde a un atributo en MACG. Del mismo modo, una regla de una red de contribución marginal corresponde a un atributo en MACG. Las funciones de valor agregado son sumas simples y sumas ponderadas para las representaciones respectivas. Por lo tanto, está claro que MACG no será menos sucinto que cualquiera de las representaciones. Sin embargo, MACG difiere de una manera importante. En primer lugar, no hay restricción en las operaciones realizadas por la función de valor agregado sobre los atributos. Esta es una generalización importante sobre la combinación lineal de problemas o reglas en los otros dos enfoques. En particular, hay juegos para los cuales MACG puede ser exponencialmente más compacto. La prueba de la siguiente proposición se puede encontrar en el apéndice. Proposición 1. Considere el juego de paridad n, v donde la coalición s ⊆ n tiene valor v (s) = 1 si | s |es impar, y v (s) = 0 de lo contrario. MACG puede representar el juego en el espacio O (N). Tanto la representación de múltiples problemas como las redes de contribución marginal requieren el espacio O (2n). Una segunda diferencia importante de MACG es que el modelo de atributo y la función de valor se separan limpiamente. Como se sugiere en el ejemplo en la Sección 4.2, esto a menudo nos permite una actualización más eficiente de los valores del juego a medida que cambia. Además, el mismo modelo de atributo se puede evaluar utilizando diferentes funciones de valor, y la misma función de valor se puede utilizar para evaluar el modelo de atributo diferente. Por lo tanto, MacG es muy adecuado para representar múltiples juegos. Creemos que los problemas de actualizar juegos y representar múltiples juegos son instrucciones futuras interesantes para explorar.4.4 Limitación de un agregador por atributo Antes de centrarse en un agregador por atributo para el resto del documento, es natural preguntarse si se pierde por dicha restricción. La desafortunada respuesta es sí, mejor ilustrada por lo siguiente. Considere nuevamente el problema de formar un equipo de fútbol discutido en la introducción, donde modelamos los atributos de los agentes como su capacidad para tomar las cuatro posiciones del campo, y el valor de un equipo depende de las posiciones cubiertas. Si primero agregamos cada uno de los atributos individualmente, perderemos la información de distribución de los atributos. En otras palabras, no podremos distinguir entre dos equipos, uno de los cuales tiene un jugador para cada posición, el otro tiene un jugador que puede jugar todas las posiciones, pero el resto solo puede jugar la misma posición. Esta pérdida de información de distribución se puede recuperar utilizando agregadores que toman como entrada múltiples filas de la matriz de atributos en lugar de una sola fila. Alternativamente, si dejamos tales atributos intactos, podemos dejar la carga de evaluar correctamente estos atributos a la función de valor agregado. Sin embargo, para muchos problemas que encontramos en la literatura, como el dominio de transporte de [12] y la configuración del juego de flujo de [4], la distribución de atributos no afecta el valor de las coaliciones. Además, el problema puede volverse poco complejo a medida que introducimos agregadores más complicados. Por lo tanto, nos centraremos en la representación como se define en la definición 8. 5. Valor de Shapley En esta sección, nos centramos en los problemas computacionales de encontrar el valor de Shapley de un jugador en MACG. Primero establecemos el problema con el uso de oráculos para evitar complejidades derivadas de los agregadores. Luego mostramos que cuando los atributos son linealmente separables, el valor de Shapley se puede calcular de manera eficiente. Esto generaliza las pruebas de resultados relacionados en la literatura. Para el caso separable no lineal, consideramos una heurística natural para estimar el valor de Shapley y estudiamos la heurística teórica y empíricamente.5.1 Configuración de problemas Comenzamos señalando que calcular el valor de Shapley para agregadores simples puede ser difícil en general. En particular, podemos definir agregadores para calcular la mayoría ponderada sobre su conjunto de entradas de agentes. Como se señaló en [6], encontrar el valor de Shapley de un juego mayoritario ponderado es #P-Hard. Por lo tanto, la discusión sobre la complejidad del valor de Shapley para MACG con agregadores sin restricciones es discutible. En lugar de colocar una restricción explícita en el agregador, suponemos que el valor de Shapley del agregador puede ser respondido por un oráculo. Para la notación, deje que φi (U) denote el valor de Shapley para algún juego u. Hacemos la siguiente suposición: Asunción 1. Para cada agregador AJ en un MACG, hay un oráculo asociado que responde al valor de Shapley del juego de atributo j. En otras palabras, se conoce φi (AJ). Para muchos agregadores que realizan operaciones básicas sobre su entrada, existe el oráculo de tiempo polinomial para el valor de Shapley. Esto incluye operaciones como suma y funciones simétricas cuando los atributos están restringidos a {0, 1}. Además, cuando solo unos pocos agentes tienen un efecto en el agregador, el cálculo de fuerza bruta para el valor de Shapley es factible. Por lo tanto, la suposición anterior es razonable para muchos entornos. En cualquier caso, dicha abstracción nos permite centrarnos en la función de valor agregado.5.2 Atributos linealmente separables Cuando la función de valor agregado se puede escribir como una función lineal de los atributos, el valor de Shapley del juego se puede calcular de manera eficiente. Teorema 1. Dado un juego n, v representado como un Macg n, M, A, A, W, si la función de valor agregado puede escribirse como una función lineal de sus atributos, es decir, w (a (a, s)) = m j =1 CJ AJ (A, S) El valor de Shapley del agente I en n, V viene dado por φi (v) = m j = 1 cj φi (aj) (1) prueba. Primero, observamos que el valor de Shapley satisface un axioma de aditividad [11]. El valor de Shapley satisface la aditividad, a saber, φi (a + b) = φi (a) + φi (b), donde n, a + b es un juego definido para ser (a + b) (s) = a (s)+ b (s) para todos s ⊆ N. También está claro que el valor de Shapley satisface el escala, a saber φi (αV) = αφi (v) donde (αV) (s) = αV (s) para todos S ⊆ N.La función de valor agregado se puede expresar como una suma ponderada de juegos de atributos, φi (v) = φi (w (a)) = φi (m j = 1 cjaj) = m j = 1 cjφi (AJ) muchos resultados positivos con respecto a la computación eficientedel valor de Shapley en la literatura depende de alguna forma de linealidad. Los ejemplos incluyen el juego de bordes en gráficos de Deng y Papadimitriou [5], la representación de múltiples problemas de [3] y las redes de contribución marginal de [7]. La clave para determinar si el valor de Shapley se puede calcular de manera eficiente depende de la separabilidad lineal de los atributos. Una vez que esto esté satisfecho, siempre que el valor de Shapley del juego de atributos pueda determinarse de manera eficiente, el valor de Shapley de todo el juego puede calcularse de manera eficiente. Corolario 1. El valor de Shapley para el juego que abarca el borde de [5], los juegos en la representación de múltiples problemas [3] y los juegos en redes de contribución marginal [7], se pueden calcular en tiempo polinomial.5.3 Combinación polinómica de atributos Cuando la función de valor agregado no se puede expresar como una función lineal de sus atributos, calcular el valor de Shapley exactamente es difícil. Aquí, nos centraremos en la función de valor agregado que puede expresarse como un polinomio de sus atributos. Si no colocamos un límite en el grado del polinomio, y el juego N, V no es necesariamente monotónico, el problema es #P-Hard. Teorema 2. Calcular el valor de Shapley de un MacG n, M, A, A, W, cuando W puede ser un polinomio arbitrario de los agregados A, es #P-Hard, incluso cuando el valor de Shapley de cada agregador puede calcularse de manera eficiente. La prueba es a través de la reducción de la coincidencia tridimensional, y los detalles se pueden encontrar en el apéndice. Incluso si nos restringimos a los juegos monotónicos, y los coeficientes no negativos para la función de valor agregado polinomial, calcular el valor exacto de Shapley aún puede ser difícil. Por ejemplo, suponga que hay dos atributos. Todos los agentes en algún conjunto B ⊆ n poseen el primer atributo, y todos los agentes en algún conjunto C ⊆ n poseen el segundo, y B y C son disjuntos. Para una coalición s ⊆ n, el agregador para el primero evalúa a 1 si y solo si | s ∩ b |≥ b, y de manera similar, el agregador para el segundo evalúa a 1 si y solo si | s ∩ c |≥ c. Deje que la cardinalidad de los conjuntos B y C sea B y C.Podemos verificar que el valor de Shapley de un agente I en B es igual a φi = 1 b b −1 i = 0 b i ¡c c c −1 ¡b + c c + i - 1 ¡c - c + 1 b + c - c - i +1 La ecuación corresponde a una suma ponderada de valores de probabilidad de variables aleatorias hipergeométricas. La correspondencia con la distribución hipergeométrica se debe al muestreo sin la naturaleza de reemplazo del valor de Shapley. Hasta donde sabemos, no hay una fórmula de forma cercana para evaluar la suma anterior. Además, a medida que aumenta el número de atributos involucrados, nos movemos a variables aleatorias hipergeométricas multvariables, y el número de sumandos crece exponencialmente en el número de atributos. Por lo tanto, es muy poco probable que el valor exacto de Shapley se pueda determinar de manera eficiente. Por lo tanto, buscamos aproximación.5.3.1 Aproximación Primero, necesitamos un criterio para evaluar qué tan bien una estimación, ˆφ, se aproxima al verdadero valor de Shapley, φ. Consideramos los siguientes tres criterios naturales: • Subestimación máxima: maxi φi/ˆφi • máximo sobreestimado: maxi ˆφi/φi • Variación total: 1 2 è I | φi - ˆφi |, o alternativamente maxs |È i∈S φi - è i∈S ˆφi |El criterio de variación total es más significativo cuando normalizamos el juego a tener un valor de 1 para la Gran Coalición, es decir, V (N) = 1. También podemos definir análogos aditivos de los subestimados y sobreestimados, especialmente cuando los juegos están normalizados.174 Asumiremos por ahora que la función de valor agregado es un polinomio sobre los atributos con coeficientes no negativos. También asumiremos que los agregadores son simples. Evaluaremos una heurística específica que es análoga a la ecuación (1). Supongamos que la función agregada se puede escribir como un polinomio con los términos p w (a (a, s)) = p j = 1 cj aj (1) (a, s) aj (2) (a, s) · · · aj ((kj) (a, s) (2) Para el término j, el coeficiente del término es cj, su grado kj y los atributos involucrados en el término son j (1) ,..., J (KJ). Calculamos una estimación ˆφ al valor de Shapley como ˆφi = P j = 1 kJ l = 1 cj kJ φi (aj (l)) (3) La idea detrás de la estimación es que para cada término, dividimos el valor del término igualmenteEntre todos sus atributos. Esto está representado por el factor CJ KJ. Luego, para cada atributo de un agente, le asignamos al jugador una parte del valor del atributo. Esta parte está determinada por el valor de Shapley del juego simple de ese atributo. Sin considerar los detalles de los juegos simples, esto constituye una regla justa (pero ciega) de compartir.5.3.2 Análisis teórico de la heurística Podemos derivar un límite simple y apretado para la subestimación máxima (multiplicativa) de la estimación heurística. Teorema 3. Dado un juego N, V representado como un Macg n, M, A, A, W, suponga que W puede expresarse como una función polinomial de sus atributos (ecuación CF (2)). Sea k = maxjkj, es decir, el grado máximo del polinomio. Deje que ˆφ denote el valor de Shapley estimado usando la ecuación (3), y φ denota el verdadero valor de Shapley. Para todos los i ∈ N, φi ≥ k ˆφi. Prueba. Limitamos el término por subestimación máximo. Deje que TJ sea el término J-th del polinomio. Observamos que el término puede tratarse como un juego entre los atributos, ya que asigna un valor a cada coalición S ⊆ N. Sin pérdida de generalidad, los atributos de Renumber J (1) a J (KJ) como 1 a KJ.tj (s) = cj kj l = 1 al (a, s) para hacer que las ecuaciones estén menos abarrotadas, deje b (n, s) = | s |!(| N | - | s | - 1)!| N |!y para un juego A, contribución del agente I al grupo s: i /∈ S, ∆i (a, s) = a (s ∪ {i}) - a (s) El verdadero valor de Shapley del juego tj es φi(tj) = cj s⊆n \\ {i} b (n, s) ∆i (tj, s) para cada coalición s, i /∈ S, ∆i (tj, s) = 1 si y solo si para AT ATal menos un atributo, digamos l ∗, ∆i (Al ∗, S) = 1. Por lo tanto, si resumimos todos los atributos, habríamos incluido L ∗ con seguridad.φi (tj) ≤ cj kj j = 1 s⊆n \\ {i} b (n, s) ∆i (aj, s) = kj kj j = 1 cj kj φi (aj) = kj ˆφi (t) suma deLos términos, vemos que el peor de los casos subestima es por el máximo grado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, dado que el límite es multiplicativo, podemos normalizar el juego a tener V (n) = 1. Como corolario, debido a que no podemos sobreestimar ningún conjunto en más de K veces, obtenemos un límite en la variación total: Corolario 2. La variación total entre el valor de Shapley estimado y el valor de Shapley verdadero, para la función del valor agregado polinomial limitado de K-gredes, es K-1 K. Podemos demostrar que este límite es apretado. Ejemplo 1. Considere un juego con N jugadores y atributos K. Deje que los primeros agentes (n - 1) sean un miembro de los primeros atributos (k - 1), y que el agregador correspondiente devuelva 1 si alguno de los primeros agentes (k - 1) está presente. Deje que el agente N-Thing sea el único miembro del atributo K-Th. El Shapley estimado asignará un valor de k-1 k 1 n-1 a los primeros agentes (n-1) y 1 k al agente n. Sin embargo, el verdadero valor de Shapley del agente N-Th tiende a 1 como n → ∞, y la variación total se acerca a K-1 k. En general, no podemos limitar cuánto ˆφ puede sobreestimar el verdadero valor de Shapley. El problema es que ˆφi puede ser distinto de cero para el agente I a pesar de que no puede tener influencia sobre el resultado de un juego cuando los atributos se multiplican juntos, como se ilustra en el siguiente ejemplo. Ejemplo 2. Considere un juego con 2 jugadores y 2 atributos, y deje que el primer agente sea miembro de ambos atributos, y el otro agente un miembro del segundo atributo. Para una coalición s, el primer agregador se evalúa a 1 si el agente 1 ∈ S, y el segundo agregador evalúa a 1 si ambos agentes están en S. mientras que el agente 2 no es un muñeco con respecto al segundo atributo, es un muñeco conrespeto al producto de los atributos. El agente 2 se le asignará un valor de 1 4 por la estimación. Como se mencionó, para juegos monotónicos simples, un juego se describe completamente por su conjunto de coaliciones mínimas ganadoras. Cuando los agregadores simples se representan como tales, es posible verificar, en el tiempo polinomial, para los agentes que giran a los muñecos después de que los atributos se multipliquen. Por lo tanto, podemos mejorar la estimación heurística en este caso especial.5.3.3 Evaluación empírica Debido a la falta de problemas de referencia para los juegos de coalición, hemos probado la heurística en instancias aleatorias. Creemos que se pueden obtener resultados más significativos cuando tenemos instancias reales para probar esta heurística. Nuestro experimento se configura de la siguiente manera. Controlamos tres parámetros del experimento: el número de jugadores (6 - 10), 175 0 0.025 0.05 0.075 0.1 0.125 0.15 0.175 0.2 6 7 8 9 10 No. de los jugadores Total VariationDistance 2 3 4 5 (a) Efecto de Max 0x 0x 0x 0x 0.0.025 0.05 0.075 0.1 0.125 0.15 0.175 0.2 6 7 8 9 10 No. de los jugadores Variación total Distancia 4 5 6 (b) Efecto del número de atributos Figura 1: Resultados experimentales El número de atributos (3 - 8), y el grado máximo del grado máximo del grado máximo delpolinomio (2 - 5). Para cada atributo, mostramos aleatoriamente una o tres coaliciones ganadoras mínimas. Luego generamos aleatoriamente un polinomio del grado máximo deseado con un número aleatorio (3 - 12) de términos, cada uno con un peso positivo aleatorio. Normalizamos cada juego para tener V (N) = 1. Los resultados de los experimentos se muestran en la Figura 1. El eje y de los gráficos muestra la variación total y el eje x el número de jugadores. Cada punto de datos es un promedio de aproximadamente 700 muestras aleatorias. La Figura 1 (a) explora el efecto del grado máximo y el número de jugadores cuando se fija el número de atributos (a las seis). Como se esperaba, la variación total aumenta a medida que aumenta el grado máximo. Por otro lado, solo hay un aumento muy pequeño en el error a medida que aumenta el número de jugadores. El error no está cerca del peor peor teórico de 1 2 a 4 5 para polinomios de grados 2 a 5. La Figura 1 (b) explora el efecto del número de atributos y el número de jugadores cuando se fija el grado máximo del polinomio (a las tres). Primero observamos que estas tres líneas están bastante bien agrupadas, lo que sugiere que el número de atributos tiene relativamente poco efecto en el error de la estimación. A medida que aumenta el número de atributos, la variación total disminuye. Creemos que este es un fenómeno interesante. Esto probablemente se deba a la construcción precisa requerida para el peor límite, por lo que a medida que hay más atributos disponibles, tenemos términos más diversos en el polinomio, y la diversidad aleja del peor límite.6. Preguntas relacionadas con el núcleo En esta sección, observamos la complejidad de los dos problemas computacionales relacionados con el núcleo: no vacilación central y membresía central. Mostramos que la no vacía del núcleo del juego entre los atributos y los núcleos de los agregadores implican la no vacía del núcleo del juego inducido por el MACG. También mostramos que no parece haber una relación general que relacione las membresías centrales del juego entre atributos, juegos de atributos y juego inducido por MACG.6.1 Configuración del problema Hay muchos problemas en la literatura para los cuales se sabe que las cuestiones de no vacunta básica y la membresía central son difíciles [1]. Por ejemplo, para el juego de Edgespanning que Deng y Papadimitriou estudiaron [5], ambas preguntas son completas. Como MACG puede modelar el juego de bordes en la misma cantidad de espacio, estos resultados de dureza también se mantienen para MACG. Como en el caso de calcular el valor de Shapley, intentamos encontrar una manera de alrededor de la barrera de dureza asumiendo la existencia de oráculos e intentamos construir algoritmos con estos oráculos. Primero, consideramos la función de valor agregado. Asunción 2. Para un MacG n, M, A, A, W, suponemos que hay oráculos que responden las preguntas de no vacía central y la membresía central para la función de valor agregado w.Cuando la función de valor agregado es una función lineal no negativa de sus atributos, el núcleo siempre no está vacío, y la membresía central se puede determinar de manera eficiente. El concepto de núcleo para el juego entre los atributos tiene más sentido cuando los agregadores son juegos simples. Además asumiremos que estos juegos simples son monotónicos. Asunción 3. Para un MacG n, M, A, A, W, suponemos que todos los agregadores son monotónicos y simples. También asumimos que hay oráculos que responden a las preguntas de no exposición central y la membresía central para los agregadores. Consideramos que esto es una suposición leve. Recuerde que los juegos simples monotónicos se describen completamente por su conjunto de coaliciones ganadoras mínimas (CF Sección 3). Si los agregadores se representan como tales, la no exposición central y la membresía central se pueden verificar en el tiempo polinomial. Esto se debe al siguiente resultado bien conocido con respecto a los juegos simples: Lemma 1. Un juego simple N, V tiene un núcleo no vacío si y solo si tiene un conjunto de jugadores de veto, digamos V, de modo que V (S) = 0 para todos S ⊇ V. Además, un vector de pago X está en el núcleo si y solo si xi = 0 para todos i /∈ V.6.2 No vacía central Existe una fuerte conexión entre la falta de vacío de los núcleos de los juegos entre atributos, juegos de los atributos y el juego inducido por un MACG. Teorema 4. Dado un juego n, v representado como un macg n, m, a, a, w, si el núcleo del juego entre atributos, 176 m, w, no es vacío, y los núcleos de los juegos de atributos no son noVacío, entonces el núcleo de N, V no está vacío. Prueba. Deje que seas un vector de pago arbitrario en el núcleo del juego entre atributos, M, w. Para cada atributo j, sea θj un vector de pago arbitrario en el núcleo del juego de atributo j. Por Lemma 1, cada atributo J debe tener un conjunto de jugadores de veto;Deje que este conjunto sea denotado por PJ. Para cada agente i ∈ N, deje yi = è j Ujθj i. Afirmamos que este vector Y está en el núcleo de N, V. Considere cualquier coalición S ⊆ N, V (S) = W (A (A, S)) ≤ J: S⊇P J UJ (4) Esto es cierto porque un agregador no puede evaluar en 1 sin todos los miembros del conjunto de veto. Para cualquier atributo J, por Lemma 1, è i∈P J θj i = 1. Por lo tanto, j: s⊇p j uj = j: s⊇p j uj i∈P j θj i = i∈S j: s⊇p j ujθj i ≤ i∈S yi tenga en cuenta que la prueba es constructiva y, por lo tanto, siSe nos da un elemento en el núcleo del juego entre los atributos, podemos construir un elemento del núcleo del juego de coalición. Del Teorema 4, podemos obtener los siguientes corolarios que se han mostrado previamente en la literatura. Corolario 3. El núcleo del juego que abarca el borde de [5] no es vacío cuando los pesos de borde no son negativos. Prueba. Deje que los jugadores sean los vértices, y sus atribuyen el incidente de los bordes sobre ellos. Para cada atributo, hay un conjunto de veto, a saber, ambos puntos finales de los bordes. Como se observó anteriormente, una función de valor agregado que es una función lineal no negativa de sus agregados tiene un núcleo no vacío. Por lo tanto, se satisface la condición previa del Teorema 4, y el juego que abarca el borde con pesos de borde no negativos tiene un núcleo no vacío. Corolario 4 (Teorema 1 de [4]). El núcleo de un juego de flujo con control del comité, donde cada borde está controlado por un juego simple con un conjunto de jugadores de veto, no es vacía. Prueba. Tratamos cada borde del juego de flujo como un atributo, por lo que cada atributo tiene un conjunto de jugadores de veto. Se ha demostrado que el núcleo de un juego de flujo (sin comité) no está vacío en [8]. Podemos nuevamente invocar el Teorema 4 para mostrar la falta de vacío del núcleo por los juegos de flujo con el control del comité. Sin embargo, el núcleo del juego inducido por un MACG puede no ser vacío incluso cuando el núcleo del juego entre los atributos está vacío, como lo ilustra el siguiente ejemplo. Ejemplo 3. Supongamos que la coalición ganadora mínima de todos los agregadores en un Macg n, M, A, A, W es N, entonces V (S) = 0 para todas las coaliciones S ⊂ N. Mientras v (N) ≥ 0, cualquier vector no negativox que satisface è i∈N xi = v (n) está en el núcleo de n, v. Complementario al ejemplo anterior, cuando todos los agregadores tienen núcleos vacíos, el núcleo de N, V también está vacío. Teorema 5. Dado un juego n, v representado como un macg n, m, a, a, w, si los núcleos de todos los agregadores están vacíos, v (n)> 0, y para cada i ∈ N, v ({i}) ≥0, entonces el núcleo de N, V está vacío. Prueba. Supongamos que el núcleo de N, V no es vacío. Sea X miembro del núcleo y elija un agente i tal que xi> 0. Sin embargo, para cada atributo, dado que el núcleo está vacío, por el Lemma 1, hay al menos dos coaliciones ganadoras de desargadores. Elija el SJ de Coalición ganadora que no incluye I para cada atributo j. Sea s ∗ = ë J SJ. Porque S ∗ está ganando para todas las coaliciones, V (S ∗) = V (N). Sin embargo, v (n) = j∈N xj = xi + j /∈N xj ≥ xi + j∈S ∗ xj> j∈S ∗ xj por lo tanto, v (s ∗)> è j∈S ∗ xj, contradiciendo elhecho de que X está en el núcleo de N, v. No tenemos resultados generales con respecto al problema de la falta de vacío central cuando algunos de los agregadores tienen núcleos no vacíos, mientras que otros tienen núcleos vacíos. Sospechamos que el conocimiento sobre el estado de los núcleos de los agregadores solo es insuficiente para decidir este problema.6.3 Membresía central Dado que es posible que el juego inducido por el MACG tenga un núcleo no vacío cuando el núcleo de la función de valor agregado está vacío (ejemplo 3), tratamos de explorar el problema de la membresía central suponiendo que el núcleo deSe sabe que tanto el juego entre los atributos, M, W como el juego subyacente, N, V, no son vacíos, y ven si hay alguna relación entre sus miembros. Un requisito razonable es si un vector de pago X en el núcleo de N, V puede descomponerse y volver a secuirse a un vector de pago en el núcleo de M, w. Formalmente, definición 11. Decimos que un vector x ∈ Rn ≥0 puede descomponerse y volver a agregarse en un vector y ∈ Rm ≥0 si existe z ∈ Rm × n ≥0, de modo que yi = n j = 1 zij para todos i xj = m i i= 1 zij para todos j podemos referir z como acciones. Cuando no hay restricción en las entradas de Z, siempre es posible descomponer un vector de pago X en el núcleo de N, V a un vector de pago y en el núcleo de M, w. Sin embargo, parece razonable restringir que si un agente J es irrelevante para el agregador I, es decir, nunca cambia el resultado del agregador J, entonces Zij debe restringirse a 0. Desafortunadamente, esta restricción ya es demasiado fuerte. Ejemplo 4. Considere un MacG N, M, A, A, W con dos jugadores y tres atributos. Supongamos que el Agente 1 es irrelevante para el atributo 1, y el agente 2 es irrelevante para los atributos 2 y 3. Para cualquier conjunto de atributos t ⊆ m, deje que W se define como w (t) = 0 si | t |= 0 o 1 6 si | t |= 2 10 si | t |= 3 177 Dado que el núcleo de un juego con un número finito de jugadores forma un polítope, podemos verificar que el conjunto de vectores (4, 4, 2), (4, 2, 4) y (2, 4, 4), caracterizar completamente el núcleo c de m, w. Por otro lado, el vector (10, 0) está en el núcleo de N, V. Este vector no puede descomponerse y volver a agregarse a un vector en C bajo la restricción establecida. Debido a la aparente falta de relación entre los miembros del núcleo de N, V y la de M, W, creemos que un algoritmo para probar la membresía central requerirá más información que los conjuntos de veto de los agregadores y el Oráculo de la membresía central parala función de valor agregado.7. Observaciones finales Juegos de coalición de múltiples atributos constituyen una forma muy natural de modelar problemas de interés. Su requisito de espacio se compara favorablemente con otras representaciones discutidas en la literatura y, por lo tanto, sirve bien como un prototipo para estudiar la complejidad computacional de la teoría de juegos coalicionales para una variedad de problemas. Los resultados positivos obtenidos bajo esta representación pueden traducirse fácilmente a resultados sobre otras representaciones. Algunos de estos resultados corolarios se han discutido en las Secciones 5 y 6. Una dirección importante para explorar en el futuro es la cuestión de la eficiencia en la actualización de un juego y cómo evaluar los conceptos de solución sin comenzar desde cero. Como se señaló al final de la Sección 4.3, MACG es muy natural para las actualizaciones. Los resultados de representación con respecto a la eficiencia de las actualizaciones y los resultados algorítmicos sobre cómo calcular los diferentes conceptos de solución de las actualizaciones serán muy interesantes. Nuestro trabajo para aproximar el valor de Shapley cuando la función de valor agregado es una función no lineal de los atributos sugiere que también se realizará más trabajo allí. Dada la interpretación probabilística natural del valor de Shapley, creemos que un enfoque de muestreo aleatorio puede tener garantías teóricas significativamente mejores.8. Referencias [1] J. M.

Apéndice Completamos las pruebas faltantes del texto principal aquí. Para probar la Proposición 1, necesitamos el siguiente lema. Lema 2. Nets de contribución marginal Cuando todas las coaliciones están restringidas para tener valores 0 o 1 tienen la misma potencia de representación que un y/o circuito con negación a nivel literal (es decir, circuito AC0) de profundidad dos. Prueba. Si una regla asigna un valor negativo en las redes de contribución marginal, podemos escribir la regla mediante un conjunto correspondiente de reglas en la mayoría de N, donde n es el número de agentes, de modo que cada uno de los cuales tiene valores positivos a través de la aplicación de la ley de Morgans. Con todos los valores de las reglas no negativas, podemos tratar el paso de suma ponderado de las redes de contribución marginal se pueden ver como una OR, y cada regla como una conjunción sobre literales, posiblemente negadas. Esto coincide exactamente con un y/o circuito de profundidad dos. Prueba (Proposición 1). El juego de paridad se puede representar con un MACG utilizando un solo atributo, agregador de suma y una función de valor agregado que evalúa ese módulo de suma dos. Como función booleana, se sabe que la paridad requiere un número exponencial de implicantes principales. Por Lemma 2, un principal implante es el análogo exacto de un patrón en una regla de redes de contribución marginal. Por lo tanto, para representar la función de paridad, las redes de contribución marginal deben ser un número exponencial de reglas. Finalmente, como se muestra en [7], una red de contribución marginal es, en el peor de los casos, un factor de O (n) menos compacto que la representación de múltiples problemas. Por lo tanto, la representación de múltiples problemas también tomará espacio exponencial para representar el juego de paridad. Esto supone que cada problema en el juego está representado en forma característica. Prueba (Teorema 2). Una instancia de coincidencia tridimensional es la siguiente [6]: dada el conjunto p ⊆ w × x × y, donde w, x, y son conjuntos disjuntos que tienen el mismo número q de elementos, ¿existe una coincidencia p ⊆ p tal?que | P |= q y no hay dos elementos de P de acuerdo en cualquier coordenada. Para la notación, deje p = {p1, p2 ,..., paquete}. Construimos un macg n, m, a, a, w lo siguiente: • M: Dejamos que los atributos 1 a Q correspondan a elementos en w, (q+1) a 2Q corresponden a elementos en x, (2q+1) a 3Qcorresponde al elemento en y, y deje que haya un atributo especial (3q + 1).• N: Deje que el jugador corresponde a Pi y que haya un jugador especial.• A: Deje que AJI = 1 si el elemento correspondiente al atributo J está en PI. Por lo tanto, para las primeras k columnas, hay exactamente tres entradas distintas de cero. También establecemos A (3q+1) = 1. • A: para cada agregador J, AJ (A (S)) = 1 si y solo si la suma de la fila J de A (S) es igual a 1. • W: Producto sobreTodos AJ. En el juego n, v que corresponde a esta construcción, v (s) = 1 si y solo si todos los atributos se cubren exactamente una vez. Por lo tanto, para /∈ T ⊆ n, V (t ∪ {}) - V (t) = 1 si y solo si t cubre los atributos 1 a 3q exactamente una vez. ¡Dado que todas esas t, si existe, deben ser de tamaño Q, el número de coincidencia tridimensional viene dada por φ (v) (k + 1)!¡P!(K - q)!179",

        "Two or more companies may benefit from trading ores and processing capacities with one another.",
        "To model the metal industry, the relevant attributes are the amount of ores and the processing capacities of the companies.",
        "Given the exogenous input of market prices, the value of a group of companies will be determined by these attributes.",
        "Many real-world problems can be likewise modeled by picking the right attributes.",
        "As attributes apply to both individual agents and groups of agents, we propose the use of coalitional game theory to understand what groups may form and what payoffs the agents may expect in such models.",
        "Coalitional game theory focuses on what groups of agents can achieve, and thus connects strongly with e-commerce, as the Internet economies have significantly enhanced the abilities of business to identify and capitalize on profitable opportunities of cooperation.",
        "Our goal is to understand the computational aspects of computing the solution concepts (stable and/or fair distribution of payoffs, formally defined in Section 3) for coalitional games described using attributes.",
        "Our contributions can be summarized as follows: • We define a formal representation for coalitional games based on attributes, and relate this representation to others proposed in the literature.",
        "We show that when compared to other representations, there exists games for which a multi-attribute description can be exponentially more succinct, and for no game it is worse. • Given the generality of the model, positive results carry over to other representations.",

        "We also carry out experiments to evaluate how the heuristic performs on random instances.1 2.",
        "RELATED WORK Coalitional game theory has been well studied in economics [9, 10, 14].",

        "They consider coalitional games defined on graphs, where the players are the vertices and the value of coalition is determined by the sum of the weights of the edges spanned by these players.",
        "This can be efficiently modeled and generalized using attributes.",
        "As a formal representation, multi-attribute coalitional games is closely related to the multi-issue representation of Conitzer and Sandholm [3] and our work on marginal contribution networks [7].",
        "Both of these representations are based on dividing a coalitional game into subgames (termed issues in [3] and rules in [7]), and aggregating the subgames via linear combination.",
        "The key difference in our work is the unrestricted aggregation of subgames: the aggregation could be via a polynomial function of the attributes, or even by treating the subgames as input to another computational problem such as a min-cost flow problem.",
        "The relationship of these models will be made clear after we define the multiattribute representation in Section 4.",
        "Another representation proposed in the literature is one specialized for superadditive games by Conitzer and Sandholm [2].",
        "This representation is succinct, but to find the values of some coalitions may require solving an NP-hard problem.",
        "While it is possible for multi-attribute coalitional games to efficiently represent these games, it necessarily requires the solution to an NP-hard problem in order to find out the values of some coalitions.",
        "In this paper, we stay within the boundary of games that admits efficient algorithm for determining the value of coalitions.",
        "We will therefore not make further comparisons with [2].",
        "The model of coalitional games with attributes has been considered in the works of Shehory and Kraus.",
        "They model the agents as possessing capabilities that indicates their proficiencies in different areas, and consider how to efficiently allocate tasks [12] and the dynamics of coalition formation [13].",
        "Our work differs significantly as our focus is on reasoning about solution concepts.",
        "Our model also covers a wider scope as attributes generalize the notion of capabilities.",
        "Yokoo et al. have also considered a model of coalitional games where agents are modeled by sets of skills, and these skills in turn determine the value of coalitions [15].",
        "There are two major differences between their work and ours.",
        "Firstly, Yokoo et al. assume that each skill is fundamentally different from another, hence no two agents may possess the same skill.",
        "Also, they focus on developing new solution concepts that are robust with respect to manipulation by agents.",
        "Our focus is on reasoning about traditional solution concepts. 1 We acknowledge that random instances may not be typical of what happens in practice, but given the generality of our model, it provides the most unbiased view.",
        "Our work is also related to the study of cooperative games with committee control [4].",
        "In these games, there is usually an underlying set of resources each controlled by a (possibly overlapping) set of players known as the committee, engaged in a simple game (defined in Section 3). multiattribute coalitional games generalize these by considering relationship between the committee and the resources beyond simple games.",
        "We note that when restricted to simple games, we derive similar results to that in [4]. 3.",
        "PRELIMINARIES In this section, we will review the relevant concepts of coalitional game theory and its two most important solution concepts - the Shapley value and the core.",
        "We will then define the computational questions that will be studied in the second half of the paper. 3.1 Coalitional Games Throughout this paper, we assume that payoffs to groups of agents can be freely distributed among its members.",
        "This transferable utility assumption is commonly made in coalitional game theory.",
        "The canonical representation of a coalitional game with transferable utility is its characteristic form.",

        "A coalition game with transferable utility in characteristic form is denoted by the pair N, v , where • N is the set of agents; and • v : 2N → R is a function that maps each group of agents S ⊆ N to a real-valued payoff.",
        "A group of agents in a game is known as a coalition, and the entire set of agents is known as the grand coalition.",
        "An important class of coalitional games is the class of monotonic games.",
        "Definition 2.",
        "A coalitional game is monotonic if for all S ⊂ T ⊆ N, v(S) ≤ v(T).",
        "Another important class of coalitional games is the class of simple games.",
        "In a simple game, a coalition either wins, in which case it has a value of 1, or loses, in which case it has a value of 0.",
        "It is often used to model voting situations.",
        "Simple games are often assumed to be monotonic, i.e., if S wins, then for all T ⊇ S, T also wins.",
        "This coincides with the notion of using simple games as a model for voting.",
        "If a simple game is monotonic, then it is fully described by the set of minimal winning coalitions, i.e., coalitions S for which v(S) = 1 but for all coalitions T ⊂ S, v(T) = 0.",
        "An outcome in a coalitional game specifies the utilities the agents receive.",
        "A solution concept assigns to each coalitional game a set of reasonable outcomes.",
        "Different solution concepts attempt to capture in some way outcomes that are stable and/or fair.",
        "Two of the best known solution concepts are the Shapley value and the core.",
        "The Shapley value is a normative solution concept that prescribes a fair way to divide the gains from cooperation when the grand coalition is formed.",
        "The division of payoff to agent i is the average marginal contribution of agent i over all possible permutations of the agents.",
        "Formally, Definition 3.",
        "The Shapley value of agent i, φi(v), in game N, v is given by the following formula φi(v) = S⊆N\\{i} |S|! (|N| − |S| − 1)! |N|! (v(S ∪ {i}) − v(S)) 171 The core is a descriptive solution concept that focuses on outcomes that are stable.",
        "Stability under core means that no set of players can jointly deviate to improve their payoffs.",
        "Definition 4.",
        "An outcome x ∈ R|N| is in the core of the game N, v if for all S ⊆ N, i∈S xi ≥ v(S) Note that the core of a game may be empty, i.e., there may not exist any payoff vector that satisfies the stability requirement for the given game. 3.2 Computational Problems We will study the following three problems related to solution concepts in coalitional games.",
        "Problem 1. (Shapley Value) Given a description of the coalitional game and an agent i, compute the Shapley value of agent i.",
        "Problem 2. (Core Membership) Given a description of the coalitional game and a payoff vector x such that È i∈N xi = v(N), determine if È i∈S xi ≥ v(S) for all S ⊆ N. Problem 3. (Core Non-emptiness) Given a description of the coalitional game, determine if there exists any payoff vector x such that È i∈S xi ≥ V (S) for all S ⊆ N, andÈ i∈N xi = v(N).",
        "Note that the complexity of the above problems depends on the how the game is described.",
        "All these problems will be easy if the game is described by its characteristic form, but only so because the description takes space exponential in the number of agents, and hence simple brute-force approach takes time polynomial to the input description.",
        "To properly understand the computational complexity questions, we have to look at compact representation. 4.",
        "FORMAL MODEL In this section, we will give a formal definition of multiattribute coalitional games, and show how it is related to some of the representations discussed in the literature.",
        "We will also discuss some limitations to our proposed approach. 4.1 Multi-Attribute Coalitional Games A multi-attribute coalitional game (MACG) consists of two parts: a description of the attributes of the agents, which we termed an attribute model, and a function that assigns values to combination of attributes.",
        "Together, they induce a coalitional game over the agents.",
        "We first define the attribute model.",
        "Definition 5.",
        "An attribute model is a tuple N, M, A , where • N denotes the set of agents, of size n; • M denotes the set of attributes, of size m; • A ∈ Rm×n , the attribute matrix, describes the values of the attributes of the agents, with Aij denoting the value of attribute i for agent j.",
        "We can directly define a function that maps combinations of attributes to real values.",
        "However, for many problems, we can describe the function more compactly by computing it in two steps: we first compute an aggregate value for each attribute, then compute the values of combination of attributes using only the aggregated information.",
        "Formally, Definition 6.",
        "An aggregating function (or aggregator) takes as input a row of the attribute matrix and a coalition S, and summarizes the attributes of the agents in S with a single number.",
        "We can treat it as a mapping from Rn × 2N → R. Aggregators often perform basic arithmetic or logical operations.",
        "For example, it may compute the sum of the attributes, or evaluate a Boolean expression by treating the agents i ∈ S as true and j /∈ S as false.",
        "Analogous to the notion of simple games, we call an aggregator simple if its range is {0, 1}.",
        "For any aggregator, there is a set of relevant agents, and a set of irrelevant agents.",
        "An agent i is irrelevant to aggregator aj if aj (S ∪ {i}) = aj (S) for all S ⊆ N. A relevant agent is one not irrelevant.",
        "Given the attribute matrix, an aggregator assigns a value to each coalition S ⊆ N. Thus, each aggregator defines a game over N. For aggregator aj , we refer to this induced game as the game of attribute j, and denote it with aj (A).",
        "When the attribute matrix is clear from the context, we may drop A and simply denote the game as aj .",
        "We may refer to the game as the aggregator when no ambiguities arise.",
        "We now define the second step of the computation with the help of aggregators.",
        "Definition 7.",
        "An aggregate value function takes as input the values of the aggregators and maps these to a real value.",
        "In this paper, we will focus on having one aggregator per attribute.",
        "Therefore, in what follows, we will refer to the aggregate value function as a function over the attributes.",
        "Note that when all aggregators are simple, the aggregate value function implicitly defines a game over the attributes, as it assigns a value to each set of attributes T ⊆ M. We refer to this as the game among attributes.",
        "We now define multi-attribute coalitional game.",
        "Definition 8.",
        "A multi-attribute coalitional game is defined by the tuple N, M, A, a, w , where • N, M, A is an attribute model; • a is a set of aggregators, one for each attribute; we can treat the set together as a vector function, mapping Rm×n × 2N → Rm • w : Rm → R is an aggregate value function.",
        "This induces a coalitional game with transferable payoffs N, v with players N and the value function defined by v(S) = w(a(A, S)) Note that MACG as defined is fully capable of representing any coalitional game N, v .",
        "We can simply take the set of attributes as equal to the set of agents, i.e., M = N, an identity matrix for A, aggregators of sums, and the aggregate value function w to be v. 172 4.2 An Example Let us illustrate how MACG can be used to represent a game with a simple example.",
        "Suppose there are four types of resources in the world: gold, silver, copper, and iron, that each agent is endowed with some amount of these resources, and there is a fixed price for each of the resources in the market.",
        "This game can be described using MACG with an attribute matrix A, where Aij denote the amount of resource i that agent j is endowed.",
        "For each resource, the aggregator sums together the amount of resources the agents have.",
        "Finally, the aggregate value function takes the dot product between the market price vector and the aggregate vector.",
        "Note the inherent flexibility in the model: only limited work would be required to update the game as the market price changes, or when a new agent arrives. 4.3 Relationship with Other Representations As briefly discussed in Section 2, MACG is closely related to two other representations in the literature, the multiissue representation of Conitzer and Sandholm [3], and our work on marginal contribution nets [7].",
        "To make their relationships clear, we first review these two representations.",
        "We have changed the notations from the original papers to highlight their similarities.",
        "Definition 9.",
        "A multi-issue representation is given as a vector of coalitional games, (v1, v2, . . . vm), each possibly with a varying set of agents, say N1, . . . , Nm.",
        "The coalitional game N, v induced by multi-issue representation has player set N = Ëm i=1 Ni, and for each coalition S ⊆ N, v(S) = Èm i=1 v(S ∩ Ni).",
        "The games vi are assumed to be represented in characteristic form.",
        "Definition 10.",
        "A marginal contribution net is given as a set of rules (r1, r2, . . . , rm), where rule ri has a weight wi, and a pattern pi that is a conjunction over literals (positive or negative).",
        "The agents are represented as literals.",
        "A coalition S is said to satisfy the pattern pi, if we treat the agents i ∈ S as true, an agent j /∈ S as false, pi(S) evaluates to true.",
        "Denote the set of literals involved in rule i by Ni.",
        "The coalitional game N, v induced by a marginal contribution net has player set N = Ëm i=1 Ni, and for each coalition S ⊆ N, v(S) = È i:pi(S)=true wi.",
        "From these definitions, we can see the relationships among these three representations clearly.",
        "An issue of a multi-issue representation corresponds to an attribute in MACG.",
        "Similarly, a rule of a marginal contribution net corresponds to an attribute in MACG.",
        "The aggregate value functions are simple sums and weighted sums for the respective representations.",
        "Therefore, it is clear that MACG will be no less succinct than either representation.",
        "However, MACG differs in two important way.",
        "Firstly, there is no restriction on the operations performed by the aggregate value function over the attributes.",
        "This is an important generalization over the linear combination of issues or rules in the other two approaches.",
        "In particular, there are games for which MACG can be exponentially more compact.",
        "The proof of the following proposition can be found in the Appendix.",
        "Proposition 1.",
        "Consider the parity game N, v where coalition S ⊆ N has value v(S) = 1 if |S| is odd, and v(S) = 0 otherwise.",
        "MACG can represent the game in O(n) space.",
        "Both multi-issue representation and marginal contribution nets requires O(2n ) space.",
        "A second important difference of MACG is that the attribute model and the value function is cleanly separated.",
        "As suggested in the example in Section 4.2, this often allows us more efficient update of the values of the game as it changes.",
        "Also, the same attribute model can be evaluated using different value functions, and the same value function can be used to evaluate different attribute model.",
        "Therefore, MACG is very suitable for representing multiple games.",
        "We believe the problems of updating games and representing multiple games are interesting future directions to explore. 4.4 Limitation of One Aggregator per Attribute Before focusing on one aggregator per attribute for the rest of the paper, it is natural to wonder if any is lost per such restriction.",
        "The unfortunate answer is yes, best illustrated by the following.",
        "Consider again the problem of forming a soccer team discussed in the introduction, where we model the attributes of the agents as their ability to take the four positions of the field, and the value of a team depends on the positions covered.",
        "If we first aggregate each of the attribute individually, we will lose the distributional information of the attributes.",
        "In other words, we will not be able to distinguish between two teams, one of which has a player for each position, the other has one player who can play all positions, but the rest can only play the same one position.",
        "This loss of distributional information can be recovered by using aggregators that take as input multiple rows of the attribute matrix rather than just a single row.",
        "Alternatively, if we leave such attributes untouched, we can leave the burden of correctly evaluating these attributes to the aggregate value function.",
        "However, for many problems that we found in the literature, such as the transportation domain of [12] and the flow game setting of [4], the distribution of attributes does not affect the value of the coalitions.",
        "In addition, the problem may become unmanageably complex as we introduce more complicated aggregators.",
        "Therefore, we will focus on the representation as defined in Definition 8. 5.",
        "SHAPLEY VALUE In this section, we focus on computational issues of finding the Shapley value of a player in MACG.",
        "We first set up the problem with the use of oracles to avoid complexities arising from the aggregators.",
        "We then show that when attributes are linearly separable, the Shapley value can be efficiently computed.",
        "This generalizes the proofs of related results in the literature.",
        "For the non-linearly separable case, we consider a natural heuristic for estimating the Shapley value, and study the heuristic theoretically and empirically. 5.1 Problem Setup We start by noting that computing the Shapley value for simple aggregators can be hard in general.",
        "In particular, we can define aggregators to compute weighted majority over its input set of agents.",
        "As noted in [6], finding the Shapley value of a weighted majority game is #P-hard.",
        "Therefore, discussion of complexity of Shapley value for MACG with unrestricted aggregators is moot.",
        "Instead of placing explicit restriction on the aggregator, we assume that the Shapley value of the aggregator can be 173 answered by an oracle.",
        "For notation, let φi(u) denote the Shapley value for some game u.",
        "We make the following assumption: Assumption 1.",
        "For each aggregator aj in a MACG, there is an associated oracle that answers the Shapley value of the game of attribute j.",
        "In other words, φi(aj ) is known.",
        "For many aggregators that perform basic operations over its input, polynomial time oracle for Shapley value exists.",
        "This include operations such as sum, and symmetric functions when the attributes are restricted to {0, 1}.",
        "Also, when only few agents have an effect on the aggregator, brute-force computation for Shapley value is feasible.",
        "Therefore, the above assumption is reasonable for many settings.",
        "In any case, such abstraction allows us to focus on the aggregate value function. 5.2 Linearly Separable Attributes When the aggregate value function can be written as a linear function of the attributes, the Shapley value of the game can be efficiently computed.",
        "Theorem 1.",
        "Given a game N, v represented as a MACG N, M, A, a, w , if the aggregate value function can be written as a linear function of its attributes, i.e., w(a(A, S)) = m j=1 cj aj (A, S) The Shapley value of agent i in N, v is given by φi(v) = m j=1 cj φi(aj ) (1) Proof.",
        "First, we note that Shapley value satisfies an additivity axiom [11].",
        "The Shapley value satisfies additivity, namely, φi(a + b) = φi(a) + φi(b), where N, a + b is a game defined to be (a + b)(S) = a(S) + b(S) for all S ⊆ N. It is also clear that Shapley value satisfies scaling, namely φi(αv) = αφi(v) where (αv)(S) = αv(S) for all S ⊆ N. Since the aggregate value function can be expressed as a weighted sum of games of attributes, φi(v) = φi(w(a)) = φi( m j=1 cjaj ) = m j=1 cjφi(aj ) Many positive results regarding efficient computation of Shapley value in the literature depends on some form of linearity.",
        "Examples include the edge-spanning game on graphs by Deng and Papadimitriou [5], the multi-issue representation of [3], and the marginal contribution nets of [7].",
        "The key to determine if the Shapley value can be efficiently computed depends on the linear separability of attributes.",
        "Once this is satisfied, as long as the Shapley value of the game of attributes can be efficiently determined, the Shapley value of the entire game can be efficiently computed.",
        "Corollary 1.",
        "The Shapley value for the edge-spanning game of [5], games in multi-issue representation [3], and games in marginal contribution nets [7], can be computed in polynomial time. 5.3 Polynomial Combination of Attributes When the aggregate value function cannot be expressed as a linear function of its attributes, computing the Shapley value exactly is difficult.",
        "Here, we will focus on aggregate value function that can be expressed as some polynomial of its attributes.",
        "If we do not place a limit on the degree of the polynomial, and the game N, v is not necessarily monotonic, the problem is #P-hard.",
        "Theorem 2.",
        "Computing the Shapley value of a MACG N, M, A, a, w , when w can be an arbitrary polynomial of the aggregates a, is #P-hard, even when the Shapley value of each aggregator can be efficiently computed.",
        "The proof is via reduction from three-dimensional matching, and details can be found in the Appendix.",
        "Even if we restrict ourselves to monotonic games, and non-negative coefficients for the polynomial aggregate value function, computing the exact Shapley value can still be hard.",
        "For example, suppose there are two attributes.",
        "All agents in some set B ⊆ N possess the first attribute, and all agents in some set C ⊆ N possess the second, and B and C are disjoint.",
        "For a coalition S ⊆ N, the aggregator for the first evaluates to 1 if and only if |S ∩ B| ≥ b , and similarly, the aggregator for the second evaluates to 1 if and only if |S ∩ C| ≥ c .",
        "Let the cardinality of the sets B and C be b and c. We can verify that the Shapley value of an agent i in B equals φi = 1 b b −1 i=0  b i ¡  c c −1 ¡   b+c c +i−1 ¡ c − c + 1 b + c − c − i + 1 The equation corresponds to a weighted sum of probability values of hypergeometric random variables.",
        "The correspondence with hypergeometric distribution is due to sampling without replacement nature of Shapley value.",
        "As far as we know, there is no close-form formula to evaluate the sum above.",
        "In addition, as the number of attributes involved increases, we move to multi-variate hypergeometric random variables, and the number of summands grow exponentially in the number of attributes.",
        "Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the exact Shapley value can be determined efficiently.",
        "Therefore, we look for approximation. 5.3.1 Approximation First, we need a criteria for evaluating how well an estimate, ˆφ, approximates the true Shapley value, φ.",
        "We consider the following three natural criteria: • Maximum underestimate: maxi φi/ˆφi • Maximum overestimate: maxi ˆφi/φi • Total variation: 1 2 È i |φi − ˆφi|, or alternatively maxS | È i∈S φi − È i∈S ˆφi| The total variation criterion is more meaningful when we normalize the game to having a value of 1 for the grand coalition, i.e., v(N) = 1.",
        "We can also define additive analogues of the under- and overestimates, especially when the games are normalized. 174 We will assume for now that the aggregate value function is a polynomial over the attributes with non-negative coefficients.",
        "We will also assume that the aggregators are simple.",
        "We will evaluate a specific heuristic that is analogous to Equation (1).",
        "Suppose the aggregate function can be written as a polynomial with p terms w(a(A, S)) = p j=1 cj aj(1) (A, S)aj(2) (A, S) · · · aj(kj ) (A, S) (2) For term j, the coefficient of the term is cj , its degree kj , and the attributes involved in the term are j(1), . . . , j(kj ).",
        "We compute an estimate ˆφ to the Shapley value as ˆφi = p j=1 kj l=1 cj kj φi(aj(l) ) (3) The idea behind the estimate is that for each term, we divide the value of the term equally among all its attributes.",
        "This is represented by the factor cj kj .",
        "Then for for each attribute of an agent, we assign the player a share of value from the attribute.",
        "This share is determined by the Shapley value of the simple game of that attribute.",
        "Without considering the details of the simple games, this constitutes a fair (but blind) rule of sharing. 5.3.2 Theoretical analysis of heuristic We can derive a simple and tight bound for the maximum (multiplicative) underestimate of the heuristic estimate.",
        "Theorem 3.",
        "Given a game N, v represented as a MACG N, M, A, a, w , suppose w can be expressed as a polynomial function of its attributes (cf Equation (2)).",
        "Let K = maxjkj, i.e., the maximum degree of the polynomial.",
        "Let ˆφ denote the estimated Shapley value using Equation (3), and φ denote the true Shapley value.",
        "For all i ∈ N, φi ≥ K ˆφi.",
        "Proof.",
        "We bound the maximum underestimate term-byterm.",
        "Let tj be the j-th term of the polynomial.",
        "We note that the term can be treated as a game among attributes, as it assigns a value to each coalition S ⊆ N. Without loss of generality, renumber attributes j(1) through j(kj ) as 1 through kj. tj (S) = cj kj l=1 al (A, S) To make the equations less cluttered, let B(N, S) = |S|! (|N| − |S| − 1)! |N|! and for a game a, contribution of agent i to group S : i /∈ S, ∆i(a, S) = a(S ∪ {i}) − a(S) The true Shapley value of the game tj is φi(tj) = cj S⊆N\\{i} B(N, S)∆i(tj, S) For each coalition S, i /∈ S, ∆i(tj , S) = 1 if and only if for at least one attribute, say l∗ , ∆i(al∗ , S) = 1.",
        "Therefore, if we sum over all the attributes, we would have included l∗ for sure. φi(tj) ≤ cj kj j=1 S⊆N\\{i} B(N, S)∆i(aj , S) = kj kj j=1 cj kj φi(aj ) = kj ˆφi(T) Summing over the terms, we see that the worst case underestimate is by the maximum degree.",
        "Without loss of generality, since the bound is multiplicative, we can normalize the game to having v(N) = 1.",
        "As a corollary, because we cannot overestimate any set by more than K times, we obtain a bound on the total variation: Corollary 2.",
        "The total variation between the estimated Shapley value and the true Shapley value, for K-degree bounded polynomial aggregate value function, is K−1 K .",
        "We can show that this bound is tight.",
        "Example 1.",
        "Consider a game with n players and K attributes.",
        "Let the first (n−1) agents be a member of the first (K − 1) attributes, and that the corresponding aggregator returns 1 if any one of the first (K − 1) agents is present.",
        "Let the n-th agent be the sole member of the K-th attribute.",
        "The estimated Shapley will assign a value of K−1 K 1 n−1 to the first (n − 1) agents and 1 K to the n-th agent.",
        "However, the true Shapley value of the n-th agent tends to 1 as n → ∞, and the total variation approaches K−1 K .",
        "In general, we cannot bound how much ˆφ may overestimate the true Shapley value.",
        "The problem is that ˆφi may be non-zero for agent i even though may have no influence over the outcome of a game when attributes are multiplied together, as illustrated by the following example.",
        "Example 2.",
        "Consider a game with 2 players and 2 attributes, and let the first agent be a member of both attributes, and the other agent a member of the second attribute.",
        "For a coalition S, the first aggregator evaluates to 1 if agent 1 ∈ S, and the second aggregator evaluates to 1 if both agents are in S. While agent 2 is not a dummy with respect to the second attribute, it is a dummy with respect to the product of the attributes.",
        "Agent 2 will be assigned a value of 1 4 by the estimate.",
        "As mentioned, for simple monotonic games, a game is fully described by its set of minimal winning coalitions.",
        "When the simple aggregators are represented as such, it is possible to check, in polynomial time, for agents turning dummies after attributes are multiplied together.",
        "Therefore, we can improve the heuristic estimate in this special case. 5.3.3 Empirical evaluation Due to a lack of benchmark problems for coalitional games, we have tested the heuristic on random instances.",
        "We believe more meaningful results can be obtained when we have real instances to test this heuristic on.",
        "Our experiment is set up as follows.",
        "We control three parameters of the experiment: the number of players (6 − 10), 175 0 0.025 0.05 0.075 0.1 0.125 0.15 0.175 0.2 6 7 8 9 10 No. of Players TotalVariationDistance 2 3 4 5 (a) Effect of Max Degree 0 0.025 0.05 0.075 0.1 0.125 0.15 0.175 0.2 6 7 8 9 10 No. of Players TotalVariationDistance 4 5 6 (b) Effect of Number of Attributes Figure 1: Experimental results the number of attributes (3 − 8), and the maximum degree of the polynomial (2 − 5).",
        "For each attribute, we randomly sample one to three minimal winning coalitions.",
        "We then randomly generate a polynomial of the desired maximum degree with a random number (3 − 12) of terms, each with a random positive weight.",
        "We normalize each game to have v(N) = 1.",
        "The results of the experiments are shown in Figure 1.",
        "The y-axis of the graphs shows the total variation, and the x-axis the number of players.",
        "Each datapoint is an average of approximately 700 random samples.",
        "Figure 1(a) explores the effect of the maximum degree and the number of players when the number of attributes is fixed (at six).",
        "As expected, the total variation increases as the maximum degree increases.",
        "On the other hand, there is only a very small increase in error as the number of players increases.",
        "The error is nowhere near the theoretical worstcase bound of 1 2 to 4 5 for polynomials of degrees 2 to 5.",
        "Figure 1(b) explores the effect of the number of attributes and the number of players when the maximum degree of the polynomial is fixed (at three).",
        "We first note that these three lines are quite tightly clustered together, suggesting that the number of attributes has relatively little effect on the error of the estimate.",
        "As the number of attributes increases, the total variation decreases.",
        "We think this is an interesting phenomenon.",
        "This is probably due to the precise construct required for the worst-case bound, and so as more attributes are available, we have more diverse terms in the polynomial, and the diversity pushes away from the worst-case bound. 6.",
        "CORE-RELATED QUESTIONS In this section, we look at the complexity of the two computational problems related to the core: Core Nonemptiness and Core Membership.",
        "We show that the nonemptiness of core of the game among attributes and the cores of the aggregators imply non-emptiness of the core of the game induced by the MACG.",
        "We also show that there appears to be no such general relationship that relates the core memberships of the game among attributes, games of attributes, and game induced by MACG. 6.1 Problem Setup There are many problems in the literature for which the questions of Core Non-emptiness and Core Membership are known to be hard [1].",
        "For example, for the edgespanning game that Deng and Papadimitriou studied [5], both of these questions are coNP-complete.",

        "First, we consider the aggregate value function.",
        "Assumption 2.",
        "For a MACG N, M, A, a, w , we assume there are oracles that answers the questions of Core Nonemptiness, and Core Membership for the aggregate value function w. When the aggregate value function is a non-negative linear function of its attributes, the core is always non-empty, and core membership can be determined efficiently.",
        "The concept of core for the game among attributes makes the most sense when the aggregators are simple games.",

        "We consider this a mild assumption.",
        "Recall that monotonic simple games are fully described by their set of minimal winning coalitions (cf Section 3).",
        "If the aggregators are represented as such, Core Non-emptiness and Core Membership can be checked in polynomial time.",

        "Proof.",
        "If a rule assigns a negative value in the marginal contribution nets, we can write the rule by a corresponding set of at most n rules, where n is the number of agents, such that each of which has positive values through application of De Morgans Law.",

        "This exactly match up with an AND/OR circuit of depth two.",
        "Proof (Proposition 1).",
        "The parity game can be represented with a MACG using a single attribute, aggregator of sum, and an aggregate value function that evaluates that sum modulus two.",
        "As a Boolean function, parity is known to require an exponential number of prime implicants.",
        "By Lemma 2, a prime implicant is the exact analogue of a pattern in a rule of marginal contribution nets.",
        "Therefore, to represent the parity function, a marginal contribution nets must be an exponential number of rules.",
        "Finally, as shown in [7], a marginal contribution net is at worst a factor of O(n) less compact than multi-issue representation.",
        "Therefore, multi-issue representation will also 178 take exponential space to represent the parity game.",
        "This is assuming that each issue in the game is represented in characteristic form.",
        "Proof (Theorem 2).",
        "An instance of three-dimensional matching is as follows [6]: Given set P ⊆ W × X × Y , where W , X, Y are disjoint sets having the same number q of elements, does there exist a matching P ⊆ P such that |P | = q and no two elements of P agree in any coordinate.",
        "For notation, let P = {p1, p2, . . . , pK}.",
        "We construct a MACG N, M, A, a, w as follows: • M: Let attributes 1 to q correspond to elements in W , (q+1) to 2q correspond to elements in X, (2q+1) to 3q corresponds to element in Y , and let there be a special attribute (3q + 1). • N: Let player i corresponds to pi, and let there be a special player . • A: Let Aji = 1 if the element corresponding to attribute j is in pi.",
        "Thus, for the first K columns, there are exactly three non-zero entries.",
        "We also set A(3q+1) = 1. • a: for each aggregator j, aj (A(S)) = 1 if and only if sum of row j of A(S) equals 1. • w: product over all aj .",
        "In the game N, v that corresponds to this construction, v(S) = 1 if and only if all attributes are covered exactly once.",
        "Therefore, for /∈ T ⊆ N, v(T ∪ { }) − v(T) = 1 if and only if T covers attributes 1 to 3q exactly once.",

                "Also, the same attribute model can be evaluated using different value functions, and the same value function can be used to evaluate different attribute model.",

It is also clear that Shapley value satisfies scaling, namely φi(αv) = αφi(v) where (αv)(S) = αv(S) for all S ⊆ N. Since the aggregate value function can be expressed as a weighted sum of games of attributes, φi(v) = φi(w(a)) = φi( m j=1 cjaj ) = m j=1 cjφi(aj ) Many positive results regarding efficient computation of Shapley value in the literature depends on some form of linearity.",

It is also clear that Shapley value satisfies scaling, namely φi(αv) = αφi(v) where (αv)(S) = αv(S) for all S ⊆ N. Since the aggregate value function can be expressed as a weighted sum of games of attributes, φi(v) = φi(w(a)) = φi( m j=1 cjaj ) = m j=1 cjφi(aj ) Many positive results regarding efficient computation of Shapley value in the literature depends on some form of linearity.",

                "Both multi-issue representation and marginal contribution nets requires O(2n ) space.",
                "A second important difference of MACG is that the attribute model and the value function is cleanly separated.",
                "As suggested in the example in Section 4.2, this often allows us more efficient update of the values of the game as it changes.",
                "Also, the same attribute model can be evaluated using different value functions, and the same value function can be used to evaluate different attribute model.",
                "Therefore, MACG is very suitable for representing multiple games.",
                "We believe the problems of updating games and representing multiple games are interesting future directions to explore. 4.4 Limitation of One Aggregator per Attribute Before focusing on one aggregator per attribute for the rest of the paper, it is natural to wonder if any is lost per such restriction.",

                "Consider again the problem of forming a soccer team discussed in the introduction, where we model the attributes of the agents as their ability to take the four positions of the field, and the value of a team depends on the positions covered.",
                "If we first aggregate each of the attribute individually, we will lose the distributional information of the attributes.",
                "In other words, we will not be able to distinguish between two teams, one of which has a player for each position, the other has one player who can play all positions, but the rest can only play the same one position.",
                "This loss of distributional information can be recovered by using aggregators that take as input multiple rows of the attribute matrix rather than just a single row.",
                "Alternatively, if we leave such attributes untouched, we can leave the burden of correctly evaluating these attributes to the aggregate value function.",
                "However, for many problems that we found in the literature, such as the transportation domain of [12] and the flow game setting of [4], the distribution of attributes does not affect the value of the coalitions.",

It is also clear that Shapley value satisfies scaling, namely φi(αv) = αφi(v) where (αv)(S) = αv(S) for all S ⊆ N. Since the aggregate value function can be expressed as a weighted sum of games of attributes, φi(v) = φi(w(a)) = φi( m j=1 cjaj ) = m j=1 cjφi(aj ) Many positive results regarding efficient computation of Shapley value in the literature depends on some form of linearity.",

                "Also, the same attribute model can be evaluated using different value functions, and the same value function can be used to evaluate different attribute model.",

                "We believe the problems of updating games and representing multiple games are interesting future directions to explore. 4.4 Limitation of One Aggregator per Attribute Before focusing on one aggregator per attribute for the rest of the paper, it is natural to wonder if any is lost per such restriction.",

It is also clear that Shapley value satisfies scaling, namely φi(αv) = αφi(v) where (αv)(S) = αv(S) for all S ⊆ N. Since the aggregate value function can be expressed as a weighted sum of games of attributes, φi(v) = φi(w(a)) = φi( m j=1 cjaj ) = m j=1 cjφi(aj ) Many positive results regarding efficient computation of Shapley value in the literature depends on some form of linearity.",

                "Given the attribute matrix, an aggregator assigns a value to each coalition S ⊆ N. Thus, each aggregator defines a game over N. For aggregator aj , we refer to this induced game as the game of attribute j, and denote it with aj (A).",

                "Suppose there are four types of resources in the world: gold, silver, copper, and iron, that each agent is endowed with some amount of these resources, and there is a fixed price for each of the resources in the market.",

                "The coalitional game N, v induced by multi-issue representation has player set N = Ëm i=1 Ni, and for each coalition S ⊆ N, v(S) = Èm i=1 v(S ∩ Ni).",
                "The games vi are assumed to be represented in characteristic form.",
                "Definition 10.",
                "A marginal contribution net is given as a set of rules (r1, r2, . . . , rm), where rule ri has a weight wi, and a pattern pi that is a conjunction over literals (positive or negative).",
                "The agents are represented as literals.",
                "A coalition S is said to satisfy the pattern pi, if we treat the agents i ∈ S as true, an agent j /∈ S as false, pi(S) evaluates to true.",
                "Denote the set of literals involved in rule i by Ni.",
                "The coalitional game N, v induced by a marginal contribution net has player set N = Ëm i=1 Ni, and for each coalition S ⊆ N, v(S) = È i:pi(S)=true wi.",
                "From these definitions, we can see the relationships among these three representations clearly.",
                "An issue of a multi-issue representation corresponds to an attribute in MACG.",
                "Similarly, a rule of a marginal contribution net corresponds to an attribute in MACG.",
                "The aggregate value functions are simple sums and weighted sums for the respective representations.",
                "Therefore, it is clear that MACG will be no less succinct than either representation.",
                "However, MACG differs in two important way.",
                "Firstly, there is no restriction on the operations performed by the aggregate value function over the attributes.",
                "This is an important generalization over the linear combination of issues or rules in the other two approaches.",
                "In particular, there are games for which MACG can be exponentially more compact.",
                "The proof of the following proposition can be found in the Appendix.",
                "Proposition 1.",
                "Consider the parity game N, v where coalition S ⊆ N has value v(S) = 1 if |S| is odd, and v(S) = 0 otherwise.",
                "MACG can represent the game in O(n) space.",
                "Both multi-issue representation and marginal contribution nets requires O(2n ) space.",
                "A second important difference of MACG is that the attribute model and the value function is cleanly separated.",
                "As suggested in the example in Section 4.2, this often allows us more efficient update of the values of the game as it changes.",
                "Also, the same attribute model can be evaluated using different value functions, and the same value function can be used to evaluate different attribute model.",
                "Therefore, MACG is very suitable for representing multiple games.",
                "We believe the problems of updating games and representing multiple games are interesting future directions to explore. 4.4 Limitation of One Aggregator per Attribute Before focusing on one aggregator per attribute for the rest of the paper, it is natural to wonder if any is lost per such restriction.",
                "The unfortunate answer is yes, best illustrated by the following.",
                "Consider again the problem of forming a soccer team discussed in the introduction, where we model the attributes of the agents as their ability to take the four positions of the field, and the value of a team depends on the positions covered.",
                "If we first aggregate each of the attribute individually, we will lose the distributional information of the attributes.",
                "In other words, we will not be able to distinguish between two teams, one of which has a player for each position, the other has one player who can play all positions, but the rest can only play the same one position.",
                "This loss of distributional information can be recovered by using aggregators that take as input multiple rows of the attribute matrix rather than just a single row.",
                "Alternatively, if we leave such attributes untouched, we can leave the burden of correctly evaluating these attributes to the aggregate value function.",
                "However, for many problems that we found in the literature, such as the transportation domain of [12] and the flow game setting of [4], the distribution of attributes does not affect the value of the coalitions.",
                "In addition, the problem may become unmanageably complex as we introduce more complicated aggregators.",
                "Therefore, we will focus on the representation as defined in Definition 8. 5.",
                "SHAPLEY VALUE In this section, we focus on computational issues of finding the Shapley value of a player in MACG.",
                "We first set up the problem with the use of oracles to avoid complexities arising from the aggregators.",
                "We then show that when attributes are linearly separable, the Shapley value can be efficiently computed.",
                "This generalizes the proofs of related results in the literature.",
                "For the non-linearly separable case, we consider a natural heuristic for estimating the Shapley value, and study the heuristic theoretically and empirically. 5.1 Problem Setup We start by noting that computing the Shapley value for simple aggregators can be hard in general.",
                "In particular, we can define aggregators to compute weighted majority over its input set of agents.",
                "As noted in [6], finding the Shapley value of a weighted majority game is #P-hard.",
                "Therefore, discussion of complexity of Shapley value for MACG with unrestricted aggregators is moot.",
                "Instead of placing explicit restriction on the aggregator, we assume that the Shapley value of the aggregator can be 173 answered by an oracle.",
                "For notation, let φi(u) denote the Shapley value for some game u.",
                "We make the following assumption: Assumption 1.",
                "For each aggregator aj in a MACG, there is an associated oracle that answers the Shapley value of the game of attribute j.",
                "In other words, φi(aj ) is known.",

It is also clear that Shapley value satisfies scaling, namely φi(αv) = αφi(v) where (αv)(S) = αv(S) for all S ⊆ N. Since the aggregate value function can be expressed as a weighted sum of games of attributes, φi(v) = φi(w(a)) = φi( m j=1 cjaj ) = m j=1 cjφi(aj ) Many positive results regarding efficient computation of Shapley value in the literature depends on some form of linearity.",

                "A second important difference of MACG is that the attribute model and the value function is cleanly separated.",
                "As suggested in the example in Section 4.2, this often allows us more efficient update of the values of the game as it changes.",
                "Also, the same attribute model can be evaluated using different value functions, and the same value function can be used to evaluate different attribute model.",

                "Consider again the problem of forming a soccer team discussed in the introduction, where we model the attributes of the agents as their ability to take the four positions of the field, and the value of a team depends on the positions covered.",

It is also clear that Shapley value satisfies scaling, namely φi(αv) = αφi(v) where (αv)(S) = αv(S) for all S ⊆ N. Since the aggregate value function can be expressed as a weighted sum of games of attributes, φi(v) = φi(w(a)) = φi( m j=1 cjaj ) = m j=1 cjφi(aj ) Many positive results regarding efficient computation of Shapley value in the literature depends on some form of linearity.",

It is also clear that Shapley value satisfies scaling, namely φi(αv) = αφi(v) where (αv)(S) = αv(S) for all S ⊆ N. Since the aggregate value function can be expressed as a weighted sum of games of attributes, φi(v) = φi(w(a)) = φi( m j=1 cjaj ) = m j=1 cjφi(aj ) Many positive results regarding efficient computation of Shapley value in the literature depends on some form of linearity.",

                "An agent i is irrelevant to aggregator aj if aj (S ∪ {i}) = aj (S) for all S ⊆ N. A relevant agent is one not irrelevant.",
                "Given the attribute matrix, an aggregator assigns a value to each coalition S ⊆ N. Thus, each aggregator defines a game over N. For aggregator aj , we refer to this induced game as the game of attribute j, and denote it with aj (A).",

                "Suppose there are four types of resources in the world: gold, silver, copper, and iron, that each agent is endowed with some amount of these resources, and there is a fixed price for each of the resources in the market.",

                "For each resource, the aggregator sums together the amount of resources the agents have.",
                "Finally, the aggregate value function takes the dot product between the market price vector and the aggregate vector.",
                "Note the inherent flexibility in the model: only limited work would be required to update the game as the market price changes, or when a new agent arrives. 4.3 Relationship with Other Representations As briefly discussed in Section 2, MACG is closely related to two other representations in the literature, the multiissue representation of Conitzer and Sandholm [3], and our work on marginal contribution nets [7].",
                "To make their relationships clear, we first review these two representations.",

                "A multi-issue representation is given as a vector of coalitional games, (v1, v2, . . . vm), each possibly with a varying set of agents, say N1, . . . , Nm.",
                "The coalitional game N, v induced by multi-issue representation has player set N = Ëm i=1 Ni, and for each coalition S ⊆ N, v(S) = Èm i=1 v(S ∩ Ni).",
                "The games vi are assumed to be represented in characteristic form.",
                "Definition 10.",
                "A marginal contribution net is given as a set of rules (r1, r2, . . . , rm), where rule ri has a weight wi, and a pattern pi that is a conjunction over literals (positive or negative).",
                "The agents are represented as literals.",
                "A coalition S is said to satisfy the pattern pi, if we treat the agents i ∈ S as true, an agent j /∈ S as false, pi(S) evaluates to true.",
                "Denote the set of literals involved in rule i by Ni.",
                "The coalitional game N, v induced by a marginal contribution net has player set N = Ëm i=1 Ni, and for each coalition S ⊆ N, v(S) = È i:pi(S)=true wi.",
                "From these definitions, we can see the relationships among these three representations clearly.",
                "An issue of a multi-issue representation corresponds to an attribute in MACG.",
                "Similarly, a rule of a marginal contribution net corresponds to an attribute in MACG.",
                "The aggregate value functions are simple sums and weighted sums for the respective representations.",
                "Therefore, it is clear that MACG will be no less succinct than either representation.",
                "However, MACG differs in two important way.",
                "Firstly, there is no restriction on the operations performed by the aggregate value function over the attributes.",
                "This is an important generalization over the linear combination of issues or rules in the other two approaches.",
                "In particular, there are games for which MACG can be exponentially more compact.",
                "The proof of the following proposition can be found in the Appendix.",
                "Proposition 1.",
                "Consider the parity game N, v where coalition S ⊆ N has value v(S) = 1 if |S| is odd, and v(S) = 0 otherwise.",
                "MACG can represent the game in O(n) space.",
                "Both multi-issue representation and marginal contribution nets requires O(2n ) space.",
                "A second important difference of MACG is that the attribute model and the value function is cleanly separated.",
                "As suggested in the example in Section 4.2, this often allows us more efficient update of the values of the game as it changes.",
                "Also, the same attribute model can be evaluated using different value functions, and the same value function can be used to evaluate different attribute model.",
                "Therefore, MACG is very suitable for representing multiple games.",
                "We believe the problems of updating games and representing multiple games are interesting future directions to explore. 4.4 Limitation of One Aggregator per Attribute Before focusing on one aggregator per attribute for the rest of the paper, it is natural to wonder if any is lost per such restriction.",
                "The unfortunate answer is yes, best illustrated by the following.",
                "Consider again the problem of forming a soccer team discussed in the introduction, where we model the attributes of the agents as their ability to take the four positions of the field, and the value of a team depends on the positions covered.",
                "If we first aggregate each of the attribute individually, we will lose the distributional information of the attributes.",
                "In other words, we will not be able to distinguish between two teams, one of which has a player for each position, the other has one player who can play all positions, but the rest can only play the same one position.",
                "This loss of distributional information can be recovered by using aggregators that take as input multiple rows of the attribute matrix rather than just a single row.",
                "Alternatively, if we leave such attributes untouched, we can leave the burden of correctly evaluating these attributes to the aggregate value function.",
                "However, for many problems that we found in the literature, such as the transportation domain of [12] and the flow game setting of [4], the distribution of attributes does not affect the value of the coalitions.",
                "In addition, the problem may become unmanageably complex as we introduce more complicated aggregators.",
                "Therefore, we will focus on the representation as defined in Definition 8. 5.",
                "SHAPLEY VALUE In this section, we focus on computational issues of finding the Shapley value of a player in MACG.",
                "We first set up the problem with the use of oracles to avoid complexities arising from the aggregators.",
                "We then show that when attributes are linearly separable, the Shapley value can be efficiently computed.",
                "This generalizes the proofs of related results in the literature.",
                "For the non-linearly separable case, we consider a natural heuristic for estimating the Shapley value, and study the heuristic theoretically and empirically. 5.1 Problem Setup We start by noting that computing the Shapley value for simple aggregators can be hard in general.",
                "In particular, we can define aggregators to compute weighted majority over its input set of agents.",
                "As noted in [6], finding the Shapley value of a weighted majority game is #P-hard.",
                "Therefore, discussion of complexity of Shapley value for MACG with unrestricted aggregators is moot.",
                "Instead of placing explicit restriction on the aggregator, we assume that the Shapley value of the aggregator can be 173 answered by an oracle.",
                "For notation, let φi(u) denote the Shapley value for some game u.",
                "We make the following assumption: Assumption 1.",
                "For each aggregator aj in a MACG, there is an associated oracle that answers the Shapley value of the game of attribute j.",
                "In other words, φi(aj ) is known.",
                "For many aggregators that perform basic operations over its input, polynomial time oracle for Shapley value exists.",
                "This include operations such as sum, and symmetric functions when the attributes are restricted to {0, 1}.",

                "As suggested in the example in Section 4.2, this often allows us more efficient update of the values of the game as it changes.",
                "Also, the same attribute model can be evaluated using different value functions, and the same value function can be used to evaluate different attribute model.",

                "Consider again the problem of forming a soccer team discussed in the introduction, where we model the attributes of the agents as their ability to take the four positions of the field, and the value of a team depends on the positions covered.",
                "If we first aggregate each of the attribute individually, we will lose the distributional information of the attributes.",
                "In other words, we will not be able to distinguish between two teams, one of which has a player for each position, the other has one player who can play all positions, but the rest can only play the same one position.",
                "This loss of distributional information can be recovered by using aggregators that take as input multiple rows of the attribute matrix rather than just a single row.",

It is also clear that Shapley value satisfies scaling, namely φi(αv) = αφi(v) where (αv)(S) = αv(S) for all S ⊆ N. Since the aggregate value function can be expressed as a weighted sum of games of attributes, φi(v) = φi(w(a)) = φi( m j=1 cjaj ) = m j=1 cjφi(aj ) Many positive results regarding efficient computation of Shapley value in the literature depends on some form of linearity.",

                "Also, the same attribute model can be evaluated using different value functions, and the same value function can be used to evaluate different attribute model.",

It is also clear that Shapley value satisfies scaling, namely φi(αv) = αφi(v) where (αv)(S) = αv(S) for all S ⊆ N. Since the aggregate value function can be expressed as a weighted sum of games of attributes, φi(v) = φi(w(a)) = φi( m j=1 cjaj ) = m j=1 cjφi(aj ) Many positive results regarding efficient computation of Shapley value in the literature depends on some form of linearity.",

                "Also, the same attribute model can be evaluated using different value functions, and the same value function can be used to evaluate different attribute model.",
                "Therefore, MACG is very suitable for representing multiple games.",
                "We believe the problems of updating games and representing multiple games are interesting future directions to explore. 4.4 Limitation of One Aggregator per Attribute Before focusing on one aggregator per attribute for the rest of the paper, it is natural to wonder if any is lost per such restriction.",

                "Consider again the problem of forming a soccer team discussed in the introduction, where we model the attributes of the agents as their ability to take the four positions of the field, and the value of a team depends on the positions covered.",
                "If we first aggregate each of the attribute individually, we will lose the distributional information of the attributes.",
                "In other words, we will not be able to distinguish between two teams, one of which has a player for each position, the other has one player who can play all positions, but the rest can only play the same one position.",
                "This loss of distributional information can be recovered by using aggregators that take as input multiple rows of the attribute matrix rather than just a single row.",
                "Alternatively, if we leave such attributes untouched, we can leave the burden of correctly evaluating these attributes to the aggregate value function.",
                "However, for many problems that we found in the literature, such as the transportation domain of [12] and the flow game setting of [4], the distribution of attributes does not affect the value of the coalitions.",

It is also clear that Shapley value satisfies scaling, namely φi(αv) = αφi(v) where (αv)(S) = αv(S) for all S ⊆ N. Since the aggregate value function can be expressed as a weighted sum of games of attributes, φi(v) = φi(w(a)) = φi( m j=1 cjaj ) = m j=1 cjφi(aj ) Many positive results regarding efficient computation of Shapley value in the literature depends on some form of linearity.",
