A Grid middleware is used for this integration. In addition, an architecture for this integration is proposed and validated through simulation. Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Distributed Systes]: Client/Server, Distributed Applications. 1. INTRODUCTION Solutions for integrating heterogeneous IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems) have been proposed by several groups [6],[7],[11],[2]. Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG (Intrusion Detection Working Group) from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) [12] as follows: • Many IDSs available in the market have strong and weak points, which generally make necessary the deployment of more than one IDS to provided an adequate solution. • Attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple networks spanning several administrative domains; these domains usually utilize different IDSs. The integration of IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions. • The interoperability/integration of different IDS components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products. DIDSs (Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems) therefore started to emerge in early 90s [9] to allow the correlation of intrusion information from multiple hosts, networks or domains to detect distributed attacks. Research on DIDSs has then received much interest, mainly because centralised IDSs are not able to provide the information needed to prevent such attacks [13]. However, the realization of a DIDS requires a high degree of coordination. Computational Grids are appealing as they enable the development of distributed application and coordination in a distributed environment. Grid computing aims to enable coordinate resource sharing in dynamic groups of individuals and/or organizations. Moreover, Grid middleware provides means for secure access, management and allocation of remote resources; resource information services; and protocols and mechanisms for transfer of data [4]. According to Foster et al. [4], Grids can be viewed as a set of aggregate services defined by the resources that they share. OGSA (Open Grid Service Architecture) provides the foundation for this service orientation in computational Grids. The services in OGSA are specified through well-defined, open, extensible and platformindependent interfaces, which enable the development of interoperable applications. This article proposes a model for integration of IDSs by using computational Grids. The proposed model enables heterogeneous IDSs to work in a cooperative way; this integration is termed DIDSoG (Distributed Intrusion Detection System on Grid). Each of the integrated IDSs is viewed by others as a resource accessed through the services that it exposes. A Grid middleware provides several features for the realization of a DIDSoG, including [3]: decentralized coordination of resources; use of standard protocols and interfaces; and the delivery of optimized QoS (Quality of Service). The service oriented architecture followed by Grids (OGSA) allows the definition of interfaces that are adaptable to different platforms. Different implementations can be encapsulated by a service interface; this virtualisation allows the consistent access to resources in heterogeneous environments [3]. The virtualisation of the environment through service interfaces allows the use of services without the knowledge of how they are actually implemented. This characteristic is important for the integration of IDSs as the same service interfaces can be exposed by different IDSs. Grid middleware can thus be used to implement a great variety of services. Some functions provided by Grid middleware are [3]: (i) data management services, including access services, replication, and localisation; (ii) workflow services that implement coordinate execution of multiple applications on multiple resources; (iii) auditing services that perform the detection of frauds or intrusions; (iv) monitoring services which implement the discovery of sensors in a distributed environment and generate alerts under determined conditions; (v) services for identification of problems in a distributed environment, which implement the correlation of information from disparate and distributed logs. These services are important for the implementation of a DIDSoG. A DIDS needs services for the location of and access to distributed data from different IDSs. Auditing and monitoring services take care of the proper needs of the DIDSs such as: secure storage, data analysis to detect intrusions, discovery of distributed sensors, and sending of alerts. The correlation of distributed logs is also relevant because the detection of distributed attacks depends on the correlation of the alert information generated by the different IDSs that compose the DIDSoG. The next sections of this article are organized as follows. Section 2 presents related work. The proposed model is presented in Section 3. Section 4 describes the development and a case study. Results and discussion are presented in Section 5. Conclusions and future work are discussed in Section 6. 2. RELATED WORK DIDMA [5] is a flexible, scalable, reliable, and platformindependent DIDS. DIDMA architecture allows distributed analysis of events and can be easily extended by developing new agents. However, the integration with existing IDSs and the development of security components are presented as future work [5]. The extensibility of DIDS DIDMA and the integration with other IDSs are goals pursued by DIDSoG. The flexibility, scalability, platform independence, reliability and security components discussed in [5] are achieved in DIDSoG by using a Grid platform. More efficient techniques for analysis of great amounts of data in wide scale networks based on clustering and applicable to DIDSs are presented in [13]. The integration of heterogeneous IDSs to increase the variety of intrusion detection techniques in the environment is mentioned as future work [13] DIDSoG thus aims at integrating heterogeneous IDSs [13]. Ref. [10] presents a hierarchical architecture for a DIDS; information is collected, aggregated, correlated and analysed as it is sent up in the hierarchy. The architecture comprises of several components for: monitoring, correlation, intrusion detection by statistics, detection by signatures and answers. Components in the same level of the hierarchy cooperate with one another. The integration proposed by DIDSoG also follows a hierarchical architecture. Each IDS integrated to the DIDSoG offers functionalities at a given level of the hierarchy and requests functionalities from IDSs from another level. The hierarchy presented in [10] integrates homogeneous IDSs whereas the hierarchical architecture of DIDSoG integrates heterogeneous IDSs. There are proposals on integrating computational Grids and IDSs [6],[7],[11],[2]. Ref. [6] and [7] propose the use of Globus Toolkit for intrusion detection, especially for DoS (Denial of Service) and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks; Globus is used due to the need to process great amounts of data to detect these kinds of attack. A two-phase processing architecture is presented. The first phase aims at the detection of momentary attacks, while the second phase is concerned with chronic or perennial attacks. Traditional IDSs or DIDSs are generally coordinated by a central point; a characteristic that leaves them prone to attacks. Leu et al. [6] point out that IDSs developed upon Grids platforms are less vulnerable to attacks because of the distribution provided for such platforms. Leu et al. [6],[7] have used tools to generate several types of attacks - including TCP, ICMP and UDP flooding - and have demonstrated through experimental results the advantages of applying computational Grids to IDSs. This work proposes the development of a DIDS upon a Grid platform. However, the resulting DIDS integrates heterogeneous IDSs whereas the DIDSs upon Grids presented by Leu et al. [6][7] do not consider the integration of heterogeneous IDSs. The processing in phases [6][7] is also contemplated by DIDSoG, which is enabled by the specification of several levels of processing allowed by the integration of heterogeneous IDSs. The DIDS GIDA (Grid Intrusion Detection Architecture) targets at the detection of intrusions in a Grid environment [11]. GridSim Grid simulator was used for the validation of DIDS GIDA. Homogeneous resources were used to simplify the development [11]. However, the possibility of applying heterogeneous detection systems is left for future work Another DIDS for Grids is presented by Choon and Samsudim [2]. Scenarios demonstrating how a DIDS can execute on a Grid environment are presented. DIDSoG does not aim at detecting intrusions in a Grid environment. In contrast, DIDSoG uses the Grid to compose a DIDS by integrating specific IDSs; the resulting DIDS could however be used to identify attacks in a Grid environment. Local and distributed attacks can be detected through the integration of traditional IDSs while attacks particular to Grids can be detected through the integration of Grid IDSs. 3. THE PROPOSED MODEL DIDSoG presents a hierarchy of intrusion detection services; this hierarchy is organized through a two-dimensional vector defined by Scope:Complexity. The IDSs composing DIDSoG can be organized in different levels of scope or complexity, depending on its functionalities, the topology of the target environment and expected results. Figure 1 presents a DIDSoG composed by different intrusion detection services (i.e. data gathering, data aggregation, data correlation, analysis, intrusion response and management) provided by different IDSs. The information flow and the relationship between the levels of scope and complexity are presented in this figure. Information about the environment (host, network or application) is collected by Sensors located both in user 1s and user 2s computers in domain 1. The information is sent to both simple Analysers that act on the information from a single host (level 1:1), and to aggregation and correlation services that act on information from multiple hosts from the same domain (level 2:1). Simple Analysers in the first scope level send the information to more complex Analysers in the next levels of complexity (level 1: N). When an Analyser detects an intrusion, it communicates with Countermeasure and Monitoring services registered to its scope. An Analyser can invoke a Countermeasure service that replies to a detected attack, or informs a Monitoring service about the ongoing attack, so the administrator can act accordingly. Aggregation and correlation resources in the second scope receive information from Sensors from different users computers (user 1s and user 2s) in the domain 1. These resources process the received information and send it to the analysis resources registered to the first level of complexity in the second scope (level 2:1). The information is also sent to the aggregation and correlation resources registered in the first level of complexity in the next scope (level 3:1). User 1 Domain 1 Analysers Level 1:1 Local Sensors Analysers Level 1:N Aggreg. Correlation Level 2:1 User 2 Domain 1 Local Sensors Analysers Level 2:1 Analysers Level 2:N Aggreg. Correlation Level 3:1 Domain 2 Monitor Level 1 Monitor Level 2 Analysers Level 3:1 Analysers Level 3:N Monitor Level 3 Response Level 1 Response Level 2 Response Level 3 Fig. 1. How DIDSoG works. The analysis resources in the second scope act like the analysis resources in the first scope, directing the information to a more complex analysis resource and putting the Countermeasure and Monitoring resources in action in case of detected attacks. Aggregation and correlation resources in the third scope receive information from domains 1 and 2. These resources then carry out the aggregation and correlation of the information from different domains and send it to the analysis resources in the first level of complexity in the third scope (level 3:1). The information could also be sent to the aggregate service in the next scope in case of any resources registered to such level. The analysis resources in the third scope act similar to the analysis resources in the first and second scopes, except that the analysis resources in the third scope act on information from multiple domains. The functionalities of the registered resources in each of the scopes and complexity level can vary from one environment to another. The model allows the development of N levels of scope and complexity. Figure 2 presents the architecture of a resource participating in the DIDSoG. Initially, the resource registers itself to GIS (Grid Information Service) so other participating resources can query the services provided. After registering itself, the resource requests information about other intrusion detection resources registered to the GIS. A given resource of DIDSoG interacts with other resources, by receiving data from the Source Resources, processing it, and sending the results to the Destination Resources, therefore forming a grid of intrusion detection resources. Grid Resource BaseNative IDS Grid Origin Resources Grid Destination Resources Grid Information Service Descri ptor Connec tor Fig. 2. Architecture of a resource participating of the DIDSoG. A resource is made up of four components: Base, Connector, Descriptor and Native IDS. Native IDS corresponds to the IDS being integrated to the DIDSoG. This component process the data received from the Origin Resources and generates new data to be sent to the Destination Resources. A Native IDS component can be any tool processes information related to intrusion detection, including analysis, data gathering, data aggregation, data correlation, intrusion response or management. The Descriptor is responsible for the information that identifies a resource and its respective Destination Resources in the DIDSoG. Figure 3 presents the class diagram of the stored information by the Descriptor. The ResourceDescriptor class has Feature, Level, DataType and Target Resources type members. Feature class represents the functionalities that a resource has. Type, name and version attributes refer to the functions offered by the Native IDS component, its name and version, respectively. Level class identifies the level of target and complexity in which the resource acts. DataType class represents the data format that the resource accepts to receive. DataType class is specialized by classes Text, XML and Binary. Class XML contains the DTDFile attribute to specify the DTD file that validates the received XML. -ident -version -description ResourceDescriptor -featureType -name -version Feature 1 1 -type -version DataType -escope -complex Level 1 1 Text Binary -DTDFile XML 1 1 TargetResources 1 1 10..* -featureType Resource11 1 1 Fig. 3. Class Diagram of the Descriptor component. TargetResources class represents the features of the Destination Resources of a determined resource. This class aggregates Resource. The Resource class identifies the characteristics of a Destination Resource. This identification is made through the featureType attribute and the Level and DataType classes. A given resource analyses the information from Descriptors from other resources, and compares this information with the information specified in TargetResources to know to which resources to send the results of its processing. The Base component is responsible for the communication of a resource with other resources of the DIDSoG and with the Grid Information Service. It is this component that registers the resource and the queries other resources in the GIS. The Connector component is the link between Base and Native IDS. The information that Base receives from Origin Resources is passed to Connector component. The Connector component performs the necessary changes in the data so that it is understood by Native IDS, and sends this data to Native IDS for processing. The Connector component also has the responsibility of collecting the information processed by Native IDS, and making the necessary changes so the information can pass through the DIDSoG again. After these changes, Connector sends the information to the Base, which in turn sends it to the Destination Resources in accordance with the specifications of the Descriptor component. 4. IMPLEMENTATION We have used GridSim Toolkit 3 [1] for development and evaluation of the proposed model. We have used and extended GridSim features to model and simulate the resources and components of DIDSoG. Figure 4 presents the Class diagram of the simulated DIDSoG. The Simulation_DIDSoG class starts the simulation components. The Simulation_User class represents a user of DIDSoG. This class function is to initiate the processing of a resource Sensor, from where the gathered information will be sent to other resources. DIDSoG_GIS keeps a registry of the DIDSoG resources.The DIDSoG_BaseResource class implements the Base component (see Figure 2). DIDSoG_BaseResource interacts with DIDSoG_Descriptor class, which represents the Descriptor component. The DIDSoG_Descriptor class is created from an XML file that specifies a resource descriptor (see Figure 3).

A Connector component must be developed for each Native IDS integrated to DIDSoG. The Connector component is implemented by creating a class derived from DIDSoG_BaseResource. The new class will implement new functionalities in accordance with the needs of the corresponding Native IDS. In the simulation environment, data collection resources, analysis, aggregation/correlation and generation of answers were integrated. Classes were developed to simulate the processing of each Native IDS components associated to the resources. For each simulated Native IDS a class derived from DIDSoG_BaseResource was developed. This class corresponds to the Connector component of the Native IDS and aims at the integrating the IDS to DIDSoG. A XML file describing each of the integrated resources is chosen by using the Connector component. The resulting relationship between the resources integrated to the DIDSoG, in accordance with the specification of its respective descriptors, is presented in Figure 5. The Sensor_1 and Sensor_2 resources generate simulated data in the TCPDump [8] format. The generated data is directed to Analyser_1 and Aggreg_Corr_1 resources, in the case of Sensor_1, and to Aggreg_Corr_1 in the case of Sensor_2, according to the specification of their descriptors.

Flow of the execution of the simulation. The Native IDS of Analyser_1 generates alerts for any attempt of connection to port 23. The data received from Analyser_1 had presented such features, generating an IDMEF (Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format) alert [14]. The generated alert was sent to Countermeasure_1 resource, where a warning was dispatched to the administrator informing him of the alert received. The Aggreg_Corr_1 resource received the information generated by sensors 1 and 2. Its processing activities consist in correlating the source IP addresses with the received data. The resultant information of the processing of Aggreg_Corr_1 was directed to the Analyser_2 resource. The Native IDS component of the Analyser_2 generates alerts when a source tries to connect to the same port number of multiple destinations. This situation is identified by the Analyser_2 in the data received from Aggreg_Corr_1 and an alert in IDMEF format is then sent to the Countermeasures_2 resource. In addition to generating alerts in IDMEF format, Analyser_2 also directs the received data to the Analyser_3, in the level of complexity 2. The Native IDS component of Analyser_3 generates alerts when the transmission of ICMP messages from a given source to multiple destinations is detected. This situation is detected in the data received from Analyser_2, and an IDMEF alert is then sent to the Countermeasure_2 resource. The Countermeasure_2 resource receives the alerts generated by analysers 3 and 2, in accordance with the implementation of its Native IDS component. Warnings on alerts received are dispatched to the administrator. The simulation carried out demonstrates how DIDSoG works. Simulated data was generated to be the input for a grid of intrusion detection systems composed by several distinct resources. The resources carry out tasks such as data collection, aggregation and analysis, and generation of alerts and warnings in an integrated manner. 5. EXPERIMENT RESULTS The hierarchic organization of scope and complexity provides a high degree of flexibility to the model. The DIDSoG can be modelled in accordance with the needs of each environment. The descriptors define data flow desired for the resulting DIDS. Each Native IDS is integrated to the DIDSoG through a Connector component. The Connector component is also flexible in the DIDSoG. Adaptations, conversions of data types and auxiliary processes that Native IDSs need are provided by the Connector. Filters and generation of Specific logs for each Native IDS or environment can also be incorporated to the Connector. If the integration of a new IDS to an environment already configured is desired, it is enough to develop the Connector for the desired IDS and to specify the resource Descriptor. After the specification of the Connector and the Descriptor the new IDS is integrated to the DIDSoG. Through the definition of scopes, resources can act on data of different source groups. For example, scope 1 can be related to a given set of hosts, scope 2 to another set of hosts, while scope 3 can be related to hosts from scopes 1 and 2. Scopes can be defined according to the needs of each environment. The complexity levels allow the distribution of the processing between several resources inside the same scope. In an analysis task, for example, the search for simple attacks can be made by resources of complexity 1, whereas the search for more complex attacks, that demands more time, can be performed by resources of complexity 2. With this, the analysis of the data is made by two resources. The distinction between complexity levels can also be organized in order to integrate different techniques of intrusion detection. The complexity level 1 could be defined for analyses based on signatures, which are simpler techniques; the complexity level 2 for techniques based on behaviour, that require greater computational power; and the complexity level 3 for intrusion detection in applications, where the techniques are more specific and depend on more data. The division of scopes and the complexity levels make the processing of the data to be carried out in phases. No resource has full knowledge about the complete data processing flow. Each resource only knows the results of its processing and the destination to which it sends the results. Resources of higher complexity must be linked to resources of lower complexity. Therefore, the hierarchic structure of the DIDSoG is maintained, facilitating its extension and integration with other domains of intrusion detection. By carrying out a hierarchic relationship between the several chosen analysers for an environment, the sensor resource is not overloaded with the task to send the data to all the analysers. An initial analyser will exist (complexity level 1) to which the sensor will send its data, and this analyser will then direct the data to the next step of the processing flow. Another feature of the hierarchical organization is the easy extension and integration with other domains. If it is necessary to add a new host (sensor) to the DIDSoG, it is enough to plug it to the first hierarchy of resources. If it is necessary to add a new analyser, it will be in the scope of several domains, it is enough to relate it to another resource of same scope. The DIDSoG allows different levels to be managed by different entities. For example, the first scope can be managed by the local user of a host. The second scope, comprising several hosts of a domain can be managed by the administrator of the domain. A third entity can be responsible for managing the security of several domains in a joint way. This entity can act in the scope 3 independently from others. With the proposed model for integration of IDSs in Grids, the different IDSs of an environment (or multiple IDSs integrated) act in a cooperative manner improving the intrusion detection services, mainly in two aspects. First, the information from multiple sources are analysed in an integrated way to search for distributed attacks. This integration can be made under several scopes. Second, there is a great diversity of data aggregation techniques, data correlation and analysis, and intrusion response that can be applied to the same environment; these techniques can be organized under several levels of complexity. 6. CONCLUSION The integration of heterogeneous IDSs is important. However, the incompatibility and diversity of IDS solutions make such integration extremely difficult. This work thus proposed a model for composition of DIDS by integrating existing IDSs on a computational Grid platform (DIDSoG). IDSs in DIDSoG are encapsulated as Grid services for intrusion detection. A computational Grid platform is used for the integration by providing the basic requirements for communication, localization, resource sharing and security mechanisms. The components of the architecture of the DIDSoG were developed and evaluated using the GridSim Grid simulator. Services for communication and localization were used to carry out the integration between components of different resources. Based on the components of the architecture, several resources were modelled forming a grid of intrusion detection. The simulation demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed model. Data from the sensor resources was read and this data was used to feed other resources of DIDSoG. The integration of distinct IDSs could be observed through the simulated environment. Resources providing different intrusion detection services were integrated (e.g. analysis, correlation, aggregation and alert). The communication and localization services provided by GridSim were used to integrate components of different resources. Various resources were modelled following the architecture components forming a grid of intrusion detection. The components of DIDSoG architecture have served as base for the integration of the resources presented in the simulation. During the simulation, the different IDSs cooperated with one another in a distributed manner; however, in a coordinated way with an integrated view of the events, having, thus, the capability to detect distributed attacks. This capability demonstrates that the IDSs integrated have resulted in a DIDS. Related work presents cooperation between components of a specific DIDS. Some work focus on either the development of DIDSs on computational Grids or the application of IDSs to computational Grids. However, none deals with the integration of heterogeneous IDSs. In contrast, the proposed model developed and simulated in this work, can shed some light into the question of integration of heterogeneous IDSs. DIDSoG presents new research opportunities that we would like to pursue, including: deployment of the model in a more realistic environment such as a Grid; incorporation of new security services; parallel analysis of data by Native IDSs in multiple hosts. In addition to the integration of IDSs enabled by a grid middleware, the cooperation of heterogeneous IDSs can be viewed as an economic problem. IDSs from different organizations or administrative domains need incentives for joining a grid of intrusion detection services and for collaborating with other IDSs. The development of distributed strategy proof mechanisms for integration of IDSs is a challenge that we would like to tackle. 7.

Se utiliza un middleware de cuadrícula para esta integración. Además, se propone y validada una arquitectura para esta integración a través de la simulación. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos c.2.4 [Systes distribuidos]: cliente/servidor, aplicaciones distribuidas.1. Varios grupos han propuesto soluciones de introducción para integrar IDS heterogéneas (sistemas de detección de intrusos) [6], [7], [11], [2]. El IDWG (grupo de trabajo de detección de intrusos) describe algunas razones para integrar IDSS del IETF (Grupo de Tarea de Ingeniería de Internet) [12] de la siguiente manera: • Muchos IDS disponibles en el mercado tienen puntos fuertes y débiles, lo que generalmente hace que la implementación sea necesaria la implementación de la implementaciónde más de una identificación para proporcionar una solución adecuada.• Los ataques e intrusiones generalmente se originan en múltiples redes que abarcan varios dominios administrativos;Estos dominios generalmente utilizan diferentes IDS. Luego se necesita la integración de IDSS para correlacionar la información de múltiples redes para permitir la identificación de ataques distribuidos e intrusiones.• La interoperabilidad/integración de diferentes componentes IDS beneficiaría a la investigación sobre la detección de intrusiones y aceleraría la implementación de IDS como productos comerciales. Por lo tanto, DIDSS (sistemas de detección de intrusos distribuidos) comenzaron a surgir a principios de los 90 [9] para permitir la correlación de la información de intrusión de múltiples hosts, redes o dominios para detectar ataques distribuidos. La investigación sobre DIDSS ha recibido mucho interés, principalmente porque los IDS centralizados no pueden proporcionar la información necesaria para evitar tales ataques [13]. Sin embargo, la realización de A DIDS requiere un alto grado de coordinación. Las cuadrículas computacionales son atractivas al permitir el desarrollo de la aplicación y coordinación distribuida en un entorno distribuido. La computación de la red tiene como objetivo permitir coordinar el intercambio de recursos en grupos dinámicos de individuos y/u organizaciones. Además, Grid Middleware proporciona medios para acceso seguro, administración y asignación de recursos remotos;servicios de información de recursos;y protocolos y mecanismos para la transferencia de datos [4]. Según Foster et al.[4], las cuadrículas pueden verse como un conjunto de servicios agregados definidos por los recursos que comparten. OGSA (arquitectura de servicio de cuadrícula abierta) proporciona la base para esta orientación de servicio en las redes computacionales. Los servicios en OGSA se especifican a través de interfaces bien definidas, abiertas, extensibles y independientes de la plataforma, que permiten el desarrollo de aplicaciones interoperables. Este artículo propone un modelo para la integración de IDS mediante el uso de cuadrículas computacionales. El modelo propuesto permite que los IDS heterogéneos funcionen de manera cooperativa;Esta integración se denomina DidSog (sistema de detección de intrusos distribuido en la red). Cada uno de los IDS integrados es visto por otros como un recurso a los que se accede a través de los servicios que expone. Un middleware de la cuadrícula proporciona varias características para la realización de un DIDSOG, incluyendo [3]: coordinación descentralizada de recursos;uso de protocolos e interfaces estándar;y la entrega de QoS optimizado (calidad de servicio). La arquitectura orientada al servicio seguida de las redes (OGSA) permite la definición de interfaces que son adaptables a diferentes plataformas. Las diferentes implementaciones pueden ser encapsuladas por una interfaz de servicio;Esta virtualización permite el acceso constante a los recursos en entornos heterogéneos [3]. La virtualización del entorno a través de las interfaces de servicio permite el uso de servicios sin el conocimiento de cómo se implementan realmente. Esta característica es importante para la integración de IDSS, ya que las mismas interfaces de servicio pueden verse expuestas por diferentes IDS. El middleware de la cuadrícula se puede utilizar para implementar una gran variedad de servicios. Algunas funciones proporcionadas por Grid Middleware son [3]: (i) servicios de gestión de datos, incluidos servicios de acceso, replicación y localización;(ii) servicios de flujo de trabajo que implementan la ejecución coordinada de múltiples aplicaciones en múltiples recursos;(iii) servicios de auditoría que realizan la detección de fraudes o intrusiones;(iv) Servicios de monitoreo que implementan el descubrimiento de sensores en un entorno distribuido y generan alertas en condiciones determinadas;(v) Servicios para la identificación de problemas en un entorno distribuido, que implementan la correlación de información a partir de registros dispares y distribuidos. Estos servicios son importantes para la implementación de un DIDSOG. A DIDS necesita servicios para la ubicación y acceso a datos distribuidos de diferentes IDS. Los servicios de auditoría y monitoreo se ocupan de las necesidades adecuadas de los DIDS como: almacenamiento seguro, análisis de datos para detectar intrusiones, descubrimiento de sensores distribuidos y envío de alertas. La correlación de los registros distribuidos también es relevante porque la detección de ataques distribuidos depende de la correlación de la información de alerta generada por los diferentes IDS que componen el DIDSOG. Las siguientes secciones de este artículo se organizan de la siguiente manera. La Sección 2 presenta trabajo relacionado. El modelo propuesto se presenta en la Sección 3. La Sección 4 describe el desarrollo y un estudio de caso. Los resultados y la discusión se presentan en la Sección 5. Las conclusiones y el trabajo futuro se discuten en la Sección 6. 2. El trabajo relacionado didma [5] es un DIDS flexible, escalable, confiable y independiente de la plataforma. La arquitectura de Didma permite el análisis distribuido de eventos y se puede extender fácilmente mediante el desarrollo de nuevos agentes. Sin embargo, la integración con los IDS existentes y el desarrollo de componentes de seguridad se presentan como trabajo futuro [5]. La extensibilidad de Dids Didma y la integración con otros IDS son objetivos perseguidos por Didsog. La flexibilidad, la escalabilidad, la independencia de la plataforma, la confiabilidad y los componentes de seguridad discutidos en [5] se logran en DidSog mediante el uso de una plataforma de cuadrícula. Las técnicas más eficientes para el análisis de grandes cantidades de datos en redes a gran escala basadas en la agrupación y aplicables a DIDS se presentan en [13]. La integración de IDS heterogéneos para aumentar la variedad de técnicas de detección de intrusos en el entorno se menciona como trabajo futuro [13] DidSog, por lo tanto, tiene como objetivo integrar IDS heterogéneos [13]. Árbitro.[10] presenta una arquitectura jerárquica para un DIDS;La información se recopila, se agrega, se correlaciona y se analiza a medida que se envía en la jerarquía. La arquitectura consta de varios componentes para: monitoreo, correlación, detección de intrusos por estadísticas, detección por firmas y respuestas. Los componentes en el mismo nivel de la jerarquía cooperan entre sí. La integración propuesta por Didsog también sigue una arquitectura jerárquica. Cada IDS integrado a DidSog ofrece funcionalidades en un nivel dado de la jerarquía y solicita funcionalidades de IDSS desde otro nivel. La jerarquía presentada en [10] integra IDS homogéneas, mientras que la arquitectura jerárquica de Didsog integra IDS heterogéneas. Hay propuestas sobre la integración de cuadrículas computacionales e IDS [6], [7], [11], [2]. Árbitro.[6] y [7] proponen el uso del juego de herramientas Globus para la detección de intrusos, especialmente para los ataques de DOS (denegación de servicio) y DDoS (denegación de servicio distribuida);Globus se usa debido a la necesidad de procesar grandes cantidades de datos para detectar este tipo de ataque. Se presenta una arquitectura de procesamiento de dos fases. La primera fase apunta a la detección de ataques momentáneos, mientras que la segunda fase se refiere a ataques crónicos o perennes. Los IDS o DIDS tradicionales generalmente están coordinados por un punto central;Una característica que los deja propensos a los ataques. Leu et al.[6] Señalan que los IDS desarrollados en las plataformas de cuadrículas son menos vulnerables a los ataques debido a la distribución provista para tales plataformas. Leu et al.[6], [7] han utilizado herramientas para generar varios tipos de ataques, incluidos las inundaciones TCP, ICMP y UDP, y han demostrado a través de los resultados experimentales las ventajas de aplicar las redes computacionales a los IDS. Este trabajo propone el desarrollo de A DIDS en una plataforma de cuadrícula. Sin embargo, el DIDS resultante integra IDS heterogéneo, mientras que el DIDSS sobre las cuadrículas presentadas por Leu et al.[6] [7] No considere la integración de IDS heterogéneos. El procesamiento en las fases [6] [7] también está contemplado por DidSog, que está habilitado por la especificación de varios niveles de procesamiento permitidos por la integración de IDS heterogéneos. El DIDS GIDA (arquitectura de detección de intrusión de la cuadrícula) se dirige a la detección de intrusiones en un entorno de cuadrícula [11]. El simulador de cuadrícula GridSim se utilizó para la validación de DIDS GIDA. Se utilizaron recursos homogéneos para simplificar el desarrollo [11]. Sin embargo, Choon y Samsudim presentan la posibilidad de aplicar sistemas de detección heterogéneos para el trabajo futuro. Se presentan escenarios que demuestran cómo se presenta A DIDS en un entorno de cuadrícula. Didsog no tiene como objetivo detectar intrusiones en un entorno de cuadrícula. En contraste, DidSog usa la cuadrícula para componer A DIDS integrando IDS específicos;Sin embargo, los DIDS resultantes podrían usarse para identificar ataques en un entorno de cuadrícula. Los ataques locales y distribuidos se pueden detectar mediante la integración de los IDS tradicionales, mientras que los ataques particulares de las cuadrículas se pueden detectar mediante la integración de IDS de cuadrícula.3. El modelo propuesto Didsog presenta una jerarquía de servicios de detección de intrusos;Esta jerarquía se organiza a través de un vector bidimensional definido por el alcance: la complejidad. El IDSS componiendo didSog se puede organizar en diferentes niveles de alcance o complejidad, dependiendo de sus funcionalidades, la topología del entorno objetivo y los resultados esperados. La Figura 1 presenta un DIDSOG compuesto por diferentes servicios de detección de intrusos (es decir, recopilación de datos, agregación de datos, correlación de datos, análisis, respuesta a la intrusión) proporcionadas por diferentes IDS. El flujo de información y la relación entre los niveles de alcance y complejidad se presentan en esta figura. Los sensores ubicados tanto en las computadoras del Usuario 1S y User 2s en el dominio 1 recopilan la información sobre el entorno (host, red o aplicación). La información se envía a los analizadores simples que actúan sobre la información de un solo host (Nivel 1: 1) y a los servicios de agregación y correlación que actúan sobre la información de múltiples hosts del mismo dominio (Nivel 2: 1). Analizadores simples en el primer nivel de alcance envía la información a analizadores más complejos en los siguientes niveles de complejidad (Nivel 1: N). Cuando un analizador detecta una intrusión, se comunica con los servicios de contramedidas y monitoreo registrados en su alcance. Un analizador puede invocar un servicio de contramedidas que responde a un ataque detectado, o informa un servicio de monitoreo sobre el ataque en curso, para que el administrador pueda actuar en consecuencia. Los recursos de agregación y correlación en el segundo alcance reciben información de sensores de diferentes computadoras de usuarios (Usuario 1 y Usuario 2S) en el dominio 1. Estos recursos procesan la información recibida y la envían a los recursos de análisis registrados al primer nivel de complejidad en el segundo alcance (Nivel 2: 1). La información también se envía a los recursos de agregación y correlación registrados en el primer nivel de complejidad en el siguiente alcance (Nivel 3: 1). Usuario 1 Dominio 1 Analizadores Nivel 1: 1 Analizadores de sensores locales Nivel 1: N Agreg. Correlación Nivel 2: 1 Usuario 2 Dominio 1 Analizadores de sensores locales Nivel 2: 1 Analizadores Nivel 2: N Agreg. Correlación Nivel 3: 1 Dominio 2 Nivel de monitor 1 Nivel de monitor 2 Analizadores de analizadores 3: 1 Nivel 3: N Monitor Nivel 3 Nivel de respuesta 1 Nivel de respuesta 2 Nivel de respuesta 3 Fig. 1. Cómo funciona Didsog. Los recursos de análisis en el segundo alcance actúan como los recursos de análisis en el primer alcance, dirigiendo la información a un recurso de análisis más complejo y poniendo la contramedida y monitoreo de los recursos en acción en caso de ataques detectados. Los recursos de agregación y correlación en el tercer alcance reciben información de los dominios 1 y 2. Luego, estos recursos llevan a cabo la agregación y correlación de la información de diferentes dominios y la envían a los recursos de análisis en el primer nivel de complejidad en el tercer alcance (Nivel 3: 1). La información también podría enviarse al servicio agregado en el siguiente alcance en caso de recursos registrados en dicho nivel. Los recursos de análisis en el tercer alcance actúan similares a los recursos de análisis en la primera y segunda alcance, excepto que los recursos de análisis en el tercer alcance actúan sobre información de múltiples dominios. Las funcionalidades de los recursos registrados en cada uno de los ámbitos y el nivel de complejidad pueden variar de un entorno a otro. El modelo permite el desarrollo de niveles de N de alcance y complejidad. La Figura 2 presenta la arquitectura de un recurso que participa en el DIDSOG. Inicialmente, el recurso se registra a SIG (servicio de información de cuadrícula) para que otros recursos participantes puedan consultar los servicios proporcionados. Después de registrarse, el recurso solicita información sobre otros recursos de detección de intrusos registrados en el SIG. Un recurso dado de Didsog interactúa con otros recursos, al recibir datos de los recursos de origen, procesarlo y enviar los resultados a los recursos de destino, por lo tanto, formando una cuadrícula de recursos de detección de intrusos. ID de recurso de recurso de cuadrícula ID de base de cuadrícula Recursos de origen de la cuadrícula Recursos de destino de destino Servicio de información de la cuadrícula Descritor Connecor Fig. 2. Arquitectura de un recurso que participa del Didsog. Un recurso está compuesto por cuatro componentes: base, conector, descriptor e identificaciones nativas. Los ID nativos corresponden a los ID que se integran al DIDSOG. Este proceso de componente los datos recibidos de los recursos de origen y genera nuevos datos que se enviarán a los recursos de destino. Un componente de IDS nativo puede ser cualquier información de procesos de herramienta relacionada con la detección de intrusiones, incluida la recopilación de datos, la agregación de datos, la correlación de datos, la respuesta a la intrusión o la gestión. El descriptor es responsable de la información que identifica un recurso y sus respectivos recursos de destino en el DIDSOG. La Figura 3 presenta el diagrama de clase de la información almacenada por el descriptor. La clase Descriptor de recursos tiene miembros de características, niveles, tipo de datos y recursos de destino. La clase de características representa las funcionalidades que tiene un recurso. Los atributos de tipo, nombre y versión se refieren a las funciones ofrecidas por el componente IDS nativo, su nombre y versión, respectivamente. La clase de nivel identifica el nivel de objetivo y complejidad en el que actúa el recurso. La clase DataType representa el formato de datos que el recurso acepta recibir. La clase DataType está especializada por Classes Text, XML y Binary. La clase XML contiene el atributo DTDFile para especificar el archivo DTD que valida el XML recibido.-Vident -version -Description ResourceDescriptor -FeateReType -name -Version Funcionar 1 1 -Type -Version DataType -cope -Coplex Nivel 1 1 Text -Dtdfile XML 1 1 TargetResources 1 1 10 ..* -FeateReType recurso11 1 figura 3 figura 3. Diagrama de clase del componente descriptor. La clase TargetResources representa las características de los recursos de destino de un recurso determinado. Esta clase agrega el recurso. La clase de recursos identifica las características de un recurso de destino. Esta identificación se realiza a través del atributo FeatureType y las clases de nivel y tipo de datos. Un recurso determinado analiza la información de los descriptores de otros recursos y compara esta información con la información especificada en TargetResources para saber qué recursos enviar los resultados de su procesamiento. El componente base es responsable de la comunicación de un recurso con otros recursos del DIDSOG y con el servicio de información de la cuadrícula. Es este componente el que registra el recurso y las consultas otros recursos en el SIG. El componente del conector es el enlace entre las ID de base y nativa. La información que recibe la base de los recursos de origen se pasa al componente del conector. El componente del conector realiza los cambios necesarios en los datos para que lo entiendan los ID nativos y envíen estos datos a IDS nativos para su procesamiento. El componente del conector también tiene la responsabilidad de recopilar la información procesada por las ID nativas y hacer los cambios necesarios para que la información pueda pasar por el DIDSOG nuevamente. Después de estos cambios, Connector envía la información a la base, que a su vez la envía a los recursos de destino de acuerdo con las especificaciones del componente descriptor.4. Implementación Hemos utilizado GridSim Toolkit 3 [1] para el desarrollo y evaluación del modelo propuesto. Hemos utilizado y extendido características de GridSim para modelar y simular los recursos y componentes de DidSog. La Figura 4 presenta el diagrama de clase del DidSog simulado. La clase Simulation_DidSog inicia los componentes de simulación. La clase Simulation_User representa a un usuario de DidSog. Esta función de clase es iniciar el procesamiento de un sensor de recursos, desde donde se enviará la información recopilada a otros recursos. DidSog_GIS mantiene un registro de los recursos de DidSog. La clase DidSog_BaseResource implementa el componente base (ver Figura 2). DidSog_BaseResource interactúa con la clase didsog_descriptor, que representa el componente descriptor. La clase didSog_descriptor se crea a partir de un archivo XML que especifica un descriptor de recursos (ver Figura 3). DidSog_BaseResource DidSog_descriptor 11 DidSog_GIS Simulation_User Simulation_DidSog 1 * 1 * 1 1 GridInformationservice Gridsim GridResource Fig. 4. Diagrama de clase del Didsog simulado. Se debe desarrollar un componente del conector para cada IDS nativo integrado a DidSog. El componente del conector se implementa creando una clase derivada de didSog_BaseResource. La nueva clase implementará nuevas funcionalidades de acuerdo con las necesidades de las ID nativas correspondientes. En el entorno de simulación, se integraron recursos de recopilación de datos, análisis, agregación/correlación y generación de respuestas. Se desarrollaron clases para simular el procesamiento de cada componentes de IDS nativos asociados a los recursos. Para cada identificación nativa simulada se desarrolló una clase derivada de DidSog_BaseResource. Esta clase corresponde al componente del conector de los ID nativos y apunta a la integración de IDS a DidSog. Se elige un archivo XML que describe cada uno de los recursos integrados utilizando el componente del conector. La relación resultante entre los recursos integrados al DidSog, de acuerdo con la especificación de sus respectivos descriptores, se presenta en la Figura 5. Los recursos Sensor_1 y Sensor_2 generan datos simulados en formato TCPDUM [8]. Los datos generados se dirigen a los recursos Analyser_1 y Agreg_Corr_1, en el caso de Sensor_1, y a Agreg_Corr_1 en el caso de Sensor_2, según la especificación de sus descriptores. User_1 analyser_ 1 nivel 1: 1 sensor_1 Aggreg_ Corr_1 nivel 2: 1 user_2 sensor_2 analyser_2 nivel 2: 1 analyser_3 nivel 2: 2 tcpdump tcpdump tcpdumpag tcpdumpag IDMEF IDMEF IDMEF TCPDUMPDUMT_1 Nivel 1 COLADMASUSE_2 Nivel 2 Fig. 5. 5. 5. Flujo de la ejecución de la simulación. Los ID nativos de Analyser_1 generan alertas para cualquier intento de conexión al puerto 23. Los datos recibidos de Analyser_1 habían presentado tales características, generando una alerta IDMEF (formato de intercambio de mensajes de detección de intrusos) [14]. La alerta generada se envió al recurso de contramedida_1, donde se envió una advertencia al administrador que le informó sobre la alerta recibida. El recurso Agreg_Corr_1 recibió la información generada por los sensores 1 y 2. Sus actividades de procesamiento consisten en correlacionar las direcciones IP de origen con los datos recibidos. La información resultante del procesamiento de Aggreg_Corr_1 se dirigió al recurso analyser_2. El componente IDS nativo del analyser_2 genera alertas cuando una fuente intenta conectarse al mismo número de puerto de múltiples destinos. El Analyser_2 identifica esta situación en los datos recibidos de Aggreg_Corr_1 y luego se envía una alerta en formato IDMEF al recurso contramedido_2. Además de generar alertas en formato IDMEF, Analyser_2 también dirige los datos recibidos al analyser_3, en el nivel de complejidad 2. El componente IDS nativo de Analyser_3 genera alertas cuando se detecta la transmisión de mensajes ICMP de una fuente dada a múltiples destinos. Esta situación se detecta en los datos recibidos de Analyser_2, y una alerta IDMEF se envía al recurso CounterMease_2. El recurso CounterMease_2 recibe las alertas generadas por los analizadores 3 y 2, de acuerdo con la implementación de su componente IDS nativo. Las advertencias de las alertas recibidas se envían al administrador. La simulación llevada a cabo demuestra cómo funciona Didsog. Los datos simulados se generaron como la entrada para una cuadrícula de sistemas de detección de intrusos compuestos por varios recursos distintos. Los recursos llevan a cabo tareas como la recopilación de datos, la agregación y el análisis, y la generación de alertas y advertencias de manera integrada.5. Resultados del experimento La organización jerárquica del alcance y la complejidad proporciona un alto grado de flexibilidad para el modelo. El DIDSOG se puede modelar de acuerdo con las necesidades de cada entorno. Los descriptores definen el flujo de datos deseado para los DID resultantes. Cada IDS nativo está integrado al DidSog a través de un componente conector. El componente del conector también es flexible en el DidSog. Las adaptaciones, las conversiones de tipos de datos y los procesos auxiliares que el conector necesita proporciona IDS nativo. Los filtros y la generación de registros específicos para cada IDS o entorno nativos también se pueden incorporar al conector. Si se desea la integración de un nuevo IDS en un entorno ya configurado, es suficiente desarrollar el conector para las IDS deseadas y especificar el descriptor de recursos. Después de la especificación del conector y el descriptor, el nuevo IDS está integrado al DidSog. A través de la definición de ámbitos, los recursos pueden actuar sobre los datos de diferentes grupos de origen. Por ejemplo, el alcance 1 puede estar relacionado con un conjunto dado de hosts, el alcance 2 a otro conjunto de hosts, mientras que el alcance 3 puede estar relacionado con los hosts de los ámbitos 1 y 2. Los ámbitos se pueden definir de acuerdo con las necesidades de cada entorno. Los niveles de complejidad permiten la distribución del procesamiento entre varios recursos dentro del mismo alcance. En una tarea de análisis, por ejemplo, la búsqueda de ataques simples puede hacerse con recursos de complejidad 1, mientras que la búsqueda de ataques más complejos, que exige más tiempo, puede realizarse mediante recursos de complejidad 2. Con esto, el análisis de los datos lo realiza dos recursos. La distinción entre los niveles de complejidad también se puede organizar para integrar diferentes técnicas de detección de intrusos. El nivel de complejidad 1 podría definirse para análisis basados en firmas, que son técnicas más simples;el nivel de complejidad 2 para las técnicas basadas en el comportamiento, que requieren una mayor potencia computacional;y el nivel de complejidad 3 para la detección de intrusos en aplicaciones, donde las técnicas son más específicas y dependen de más datos. La división de los ámbitos y los niveles de complejidad hacen que el procesamiento de los datos se llevará a cabo en fases. Ningún recurso tiene pleno conocimiento sobre el flujo completo de procesamiento de datos. Cada recurso solo conoce los resultados de su procesamiento y el destino al que envía los resultados. Los recursos de mayor complejidad deben estar vinculados a recursos de menor complejidad. Por lo tanto, se mantiene la estructura jerárquica del DIDSOG, facilitando su extensión e integración con otros dominios de detección de intrusos. Al llevar a cabo una relación jerárquica entre los varios analizadores elegidos para un entorno, el recurso del sensor no se sobrecarga con la tarea de enviar los datos a todos los analizadores. Existirá un analizador inicial (nivel de complejidad 1) al que el sensor enviará sus datos, y este analizador dirigirá los datos al siguiente paso del flujo de procesamiento. Otra característica de la organización jerárquica es la fácil extensión e integración con otros dominios. Si es necesario agregar un nuevo host (sensor) al DidSog, es suficiente para conectarlo a la primera jerarquía de recursos. Si es necesario agregar un nuevo analizador, estará en el alcance de varios dominios, es suficiente relacionarlo con otro recurso del mismo alcance. El DIDSOG permite que diferentes niveles sean administrados por diferentes entidades. Por ejemplo, el primer alcance puede ser administrado por el usuario local de un host. El segundo alcance, que comprende varios hosts de un dominio, puede ser administrado por el administrador del dominio. Una tercera entidad puede ser responsable de administrar la seguridad de varios dominios de manera conjunta. Esta entidad puede actuar en el alcance 3 independientemente de otros. Con el modelo propuesto para la integración de IDS en cuadrículas, los diferentes IDS de un entorno (o múltiples IDS integrados) actúan de manera cooperativa mejorando los servicios de detección de intrusos, principalmente en dos aspectos. Primero, la información de múltiples fuentes se analiza de manera integrada para buscar ataques distribuidos. Esta integración se puede hacer bajo varios ámbitos. En segundo lugar, existe una gran diversidad de técnicas de agregación de datos, correlación y análisis de datos, y respuesta de intrusión que se pueden aplicar al mismo entorno;Estas técnicas pueden organizarse bajo varios niveles de complejidad.6. Conclusión La integración de IDS heterogéneos es importante. Sin embargo, la incompatibilidad y la diversidad de las soluciones IDS hacen que tal integración sea extremadamente difícil. Por lo tanto, este trabajo propuso un modelo para la composición de DIDS integrando IDS existentes en una plataforma de cuadrícula computacional (DIDSOG). Los IDS en Didsog están encapsulados como servicios de cuadrícula para la detección de intrusiones. Se utiliza una plataforma de cuadrícula computacional para la integración al proporcionar los requisitos básicos para la comunicación, la localización, el intercambio de recursos y los mecanismos de seguridad. Los componentes de la arquitectura del didsog se desarrollaron y evaluaron utilizando el simulador de cuadrícula Gridsim. Los servicios para la comunicación y la localización se utilizaron para llevar a cabo la integración entre componentes de diferentes recursos. Según los componentes de la arquitectura, se modelaron varios recursos formando una cuadrícula de detección de intrusos. La simulación demostró la utilidad del modelo propuesto. Se leyeron datos de los recursos del sensor y estos datos se usaron para alimentar otros recursos de DidSog. La integración de IDS distintos podría observarse a través del entorno simulado. Se integraron recursos que proporcionan diferentes servicios de detección de intrusos (por ejemplo, análisis, correlación, agregación y alerta). Los servicios de comunicación y localización proporcionados por GridSim se utilizaron para integrar componentes de diferentes recursos. Se modelaron varios recursos después de los componentes de la arquitectura que forman una cuadrícula de detección de intrusos. Los componentes de la arquitectura DidSog han servido como base para la integración de los recursos presentados en la simulación. Durante la simulación, los diferentes IDS cooperaron entre sí de manera distribuida;Sin embargo, de manera coordinada con una visión integrada de los eventos, que tiene, por lo tanto, la capacidad de detectar ataques distribuidos. Esta capacidad demuestra que el IDSS integrado ha resultado en un DIDS. El trabajo relacionado presenta la cooperación entre los componentes de un DIDS específico. Algunos trabajan se centran en el desarrollo de DIDSS en las cuadrículas computacionales o la aplicación de IDS a las cuadrículas computacionales. Sin embargo, ninguno se ocupa de la integración de IDS heterogéneos. En contraste, el modelo propuesto desarrollado y simulado en este trabajo puede arrojar algo de luz sobre la cuestión de la integración de IDS heterogéneos. Didsog presenta nuevas oportunidades de investigación que nos gustaría seguir, que incluyen: despliegue del modelo en un entorno más realista, como una cuadrícula;incorporación de nuevos servicios de seguridad;Análisis paralelo de datos por IDS nativos en múltiples hosts. Además de la integración de IDS habilitados por un middleware de cuadrícula, la cooperación de IDS heterogéneos puede verse como un problema económico. Los IDS de diferentes organizaciones o dominios administrativos necesitan incentivos para unirse a una cuadrícula de servicios de detección de intrusos y para colaborar con otros IDS. El desarrollo de mecanismos de prueba de estrategia distribuida para la integración de IDSS es un desafío que nos gustaría abordar.7.

        "INTRODUCTION Solutions for integrating heterogeneous IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems) have been proposed by several groups [6],[7],[11],[2].",
        "Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG (Intrusion Detection Working Group) from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) [12] as follows: • Many IDSs available in the market have strong and weak points, which generally make necessary the deployment of more than one IDS to provided an adequate solution. • Attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple networks spanning several administrative domains; these domains usually utilize different IDSs.",
        "The integration of IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions. • The interoperability/integration of different IDS components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products.",
        "DIDSs (Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems) therefore started to emerge in early 90s [9] to allow the correlation of intrusion information from multiple hosts, networks or domains to detect distributed attacks.",
        "Research on DIDSs has then received much interest, mainly because centralised IDSs are not able to provide the information needed to prevent such attacks [13].",

        "Different implementations can be encapsulated by a service interface; this virtualisation allows the consistent access to resources in heterogeneous environments [3].",

        "Grid middleware can thus be used to implement a great variety of services.",
        "Some functions provided by Grid middleware are [3]: (i) data management services, including access services, replication, and localisation; (ii) workflow services that implement coordinate execution of multiple applications on multiple resources; (iii) auditing services that perform the detection of frauds or intrusions; (iv) monitoring services which implement the discovery of sensors in a distributed environment and generate alerts under determined conditions; (v) services for identification of problems in a distributed environment, which implement the correlation of information from disparate and distributed logs.",

        "The complexity levels allow the distribution of the processing between several resources inside the same scope.",

        "The distinction between complexity levels can also be organized in order to integrate different techniques of intrusion detection.",

        "The division of scopes and the complexity levels make the processing of the data to be carried out in phases.",
        "No resource has full knowledge about the complete data processing flow.",
        "Each resource only knows the results of its processing and the destination to which it sends the results.",

        "First, the information from multiple sources are analysed in an integrated way to search for distributed attacks.",
        "This integration can be made under several scopes.",
        "Second, there is a great diversity of data aggregation techniques, data correlation and analysis, and intrusion response that can be applied to the same environment; these techniques can be organized under several levels of complexity. 6.",
        "CONCLUSION The integration of heterogeneous IDSs is important.",
        "However, the incompatibility and diversity of IDS solutions make such integration extremely difficult.",
        "This work thus proposed a model for composition of DIDS by integrating existing IDSs on a computational Grid platform (DIDSoG).",
        "IDSs in DIDSoG are encapsulated as Grid services for intrusion detection.",
        "A computational Grid platform is used for the integration by providing the basic requirements for communication, localization, resource sharing and security mechanisms.",

        "The components of DIDSoG architecture have served as base for the integration of the resources presented in the simulation.",
        "During the simulation, the different IDSs cooperated with one another in a distributed manner; however, in a coordinated way with an integrated view of the events, having, thus, the capability to detect distributed attacks.",
        "This capability demonstrates that the IDSs integrated have resulted in a DIDS.",
        "Related work presents cooperation between components of a specific DIDS.",
        "Some work focus on either the development of DIDSs on computational Grids or the application of IDSs to computational Grids.",
        "However, none deals with the integration of heterogeneous IDSs.",
        "In contrast, the proposed model developed and simulated in this work, can shed some light into the question of integration of heterogeneous IDSs.",
        "DIDSoG presents new research opportunities that we would like to pursue, including: deployment of the model in a more realistic environment such as a Grid; incorporation of new security services; parallel analysis of data by Native IDSs in multiple hosts.",

                "Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG (Intrusion Detection Working Group) from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) [12] as follows: • Many IDSs available in the market have strong and weak points, which generally make necessary the deployment of more than one IDS to provided an adequate solution. • Attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple networks spanning several administrative domains; these domains usually utilize different IDSs.",
                "The integration of IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions. • The interoperability/integration of different IDS components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products.",
                "DIDSs (Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems) therefore started to emerge in early 90s [9] to allow the correlation of intrusion information from multiple hosts, networks or domains to detect distributed attacks.",

                "INTRODUCTION Solutions for integrating heterogeneous IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems) have been proposed by several groups [6],[7],[11],[2].",
                "Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG (Intrusion Detection Working Group) from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) [12] as follows: • Many IDSs available in the market have strong and weak points, which generally make necessary the deployment of more than one IDS to provided an adequate solution. • Attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple networks spanning several administrative domains; these domains usually utilize different IDSs.",
                "The integration of IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions. • The interoperability/integration of different IDS components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products.",
                "DIDSs (Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems) therefore started to emerge in early 90s [9] to allow the correlation of intrusion information from multiple hosts, networks or domains to detect distributed attacks.",
                "Research on DIDSs has then received much interest, mainly because centralised IDSs are not able to provide the information needed to prevent such attacks [13].",
                "However, the realization of a DIDS requires a high degree of coordination.",
                "Computational Grids are appealing as they enable the development of distributed application and coordination in a distributed environment.",
                "Grid computing aims to enable coordinate resource sharing in dynamic groups of individuals and/or organizations.",
                "Moreover, Grid middleware provides means for secure access, management and allocation of remote resources; resource information services; and protocols and mechanisms for transfer of data [4].",
                "According to Foster et al. [4], Grids can be viewed as a set of aggregate services defined by the resources that they share.",
                "OGSA (Open Grid Service Architecture) provides the foundation for this service orientation in computational Grids.",
                "The services in OGSA are specified through well-defined, open, extensible and platformindependent interfaces, which enable the development of interoperable applications.",
                "This article proposes a model for integration of IDSs by using computational Grids.",
                "The proposed model enables heterogeneous IDSs to work in a cooperative way; this integration is termed DIDSoG (Distributed Intrusion Detection System on Grid).",
                "Each of the integrated IDSs is viewed by others as a resource accessed through the services that it exposes.",
                "A Grid middleware provides several features for the realization of a DIDSoG, including [3]: decentralized coordination of resources; use of standard protocols and interfaces; and the delivery of optimized QoS (Quality of Service).",
                "The service oriented architecture followed by Grids (OGSA) allows the definition of interfaces that are adaptable to different platforms.",
                "Different implementations can be encapsulated by a service interface; this virtualisation allows the consistent access to resources in heterogeneous environments [3].",
                "The virtualisation of the environment through service interfaces allows the use of services without the knowledge of how they are actually implemented.",
                "This characteristic is important for the integration of IDSs as the same service interfaces can be exposed by different IDSs.",
                "Grid middleware can thus be used to implement a great variety of services.",
                "Some functions provided by Grid middleware are [3]: (i) data management services, including access services, replication, and localisation; (ii) workflow services that implement coordinate execution of multiple applications on multiple resources; (iii) auditing services that perform the detection of frauds or intrusions; (iv) monitoring services which implement the discovery of sensors in a distributed environment and generate alerts under determined conditions; (v) services for identification of problems in a distributed environment, which implement the correlation of information from disparate and distributed logs.",
                "These services are important for the implementation of a DIDSoG.",
                "A DIDS needs services for the location of and access to distributed data from different IDSs.",
                "Auditing and monitoring services take care of the proper needs of the DIDSs such as: secure storage, data analysis to detect intrusions, discovery of distributed sensors, and sending of alerts.",
                "The correlation of distributed logs is also relevant because the detection of distributed attacks depends on the correlation of the alert information generated by the different IDSs that compose the DIDSoG.",

                "Traditional IDSs or DIDSs are generally coordinated by a central point; a characteristic that leaves them prone to attacks.",
                "Leu et al. [6] point out that IDSs developed upon Grids platforms are less vulnerable to attacks because of the distribution provided for such platforms.",
                "Leu et al. [6],[7] have used tools to generate several types of attacks - including TCP, ICMP and UDP flooding - and have demonstrated through experimental results the advantages of applying computational Grids to IDSs.",

                "Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG (Intrusion Detection Working Group) from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) [12] as follows: • Many IDSs available in the market have strong and weak points, which generally make necessary the deployment of more than one IDS to provided an adequate solution. • Attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple networks spanning several administrative domains; these domains usually utilize different IDSs.",
                "The integration of IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions. • The interoperability/integration of different IDS components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products.",

                "INTRODUCTION Solutions for integrating heterogeneous IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems) have been proposed by several groups [6],[7],[11],[2].",
                "Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG (Intrusion Detection Working Group) from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) [12] as follows: • Many IDSs available in the market have strong and weak points, which generally make necessary the deployment of more than one IDS to provided an adequate solution. • Attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple networks spanning several administrative domains; these domains usually utilize different IDSs.",
                "The integration of IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions. • The interoperability/integration of different IDS components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products.",
                "DIDSs (Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems) therefore started to emerge in early 90s [9] to allow the correlation of intrusion information from multiple hosts, networks or domains to detect distributed attacks.",
                "Research on DIDSs has then received much interest, mainly because centralised IDSs are not able to provide the information needed to prevent such attacks [13].",
                "However, the realization of a DIDS requires a high degree of coordination.",
                "Computational Grids are appealing as they enable the development of distributed application and coordination in a distributed environment.",
                "Grid computing aims to enable coordinate resource sharing in dynamic groups of individuals and/or organizations.",
                "Moreover, Grid middleware provides means for secure access, management and allocation of remote resources; resource information services; and protocols and mechanisms for transfer of data [4].",
                "According to Foster et al. [4], Grids can be viewed as a set of aggregate services defined by the resources that they share.",
                "OGSA (<br>open grid service architecture</br>) provides the foundation for this service orientation in computational Grids.",
                "The services in OGSA are specified through well-defined, open, extensible and platformindependent interfaces, which enable the development of interoperable applications.",
                "This article proposes a model for integration of IDSs by using computational Grids.",
                "The proposed model enables heterogeneous IDSs to work in a cooperative way; this integration is termed DIDSoG (Distributed Intrusion Detection System on Grid).",
                "Each of the integrated IDSs is viewed by others as a resource accessed through the services that it exposes.",
                "A Grid middleware provides several features for the realization of a DIDSoG, including [3]: decentralized coordination of resources; use of standard protocols and interfaces; and the delivery of optimized QoS (Quality of Service).",
                "The service oriented architecture followed by Grids (OGSA) allows the definition of interfaces that are adaptable to different platforms.",
                "Different implementations can be encapsulated by a service interface; this virtualisation allows the consistent access to resources in heterogeneous environments [3].",
                "The virtualisation of the environment through service interfaces allows the use of services without the knowledge of how they are actually implemented.",
                "This characteristic is important for the integration of IDSs as the same service interfaces can be exposed by different IDSs.",
                "Grid middleware can thus be used to implement a great variety of services.",
                "Some functions provided by Grid middleware are [3]: (i) data management services, including access services, replication, and localisation; (ii) workflow services that implement coordinate execution of multiple applications on multiple resources; (iii) auditing services that perform the detection of frauds or intrusions; (iv) monitoring services which implement the discovery of sensors in a distributed environment and generate alerts under determined conditions; (v) services for identification of problems in a distributed environment, which implement the correlation of information from disparate and distributed logs.",
                "These services are important for the implementation of a DIDSoG.",
                "A DIDS needs services for the location of and access to distributed data from different IDSs.",
                "Auditing and monitoring services take care of the proper needs of the DIDSs such as: secure storage, data analysis to detect intrusions, discovery of distributed sensors, and sending of alerts.",
                "The correlation of distributed logs is also relevant because the detection of distributed attacks depends on the correlation of the alert information generated by the different IDSs that compose the DIDSoG.",

                "Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG (Intrusion Detection Working Group) from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) [12] as follows: • Many IDSs available in the market have strong and weak points, which generally make necessary the deployment of more than one IDS to provided an adequate solution. • Attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple networks spanning several administrative domains; these domains usually utilize different IDSs.",
                "The integration of IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions. • The interoperability/integration of different IDS components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products.",

                "INTRODUCTION Solutions for integrating heterogeneous IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems) have been proposed by several groups [6],[7],[11],[2].",
                "Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG (Intrusion Detection Working Group) from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) [12] as follows: • Many IDSs available in the market have strong and weak points, which generally make necessary the deployment of more than one IDS to provided an adequate solution. • Attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple networks spanning several administrative domains; these domains usually utilize different IDSs.",
                "The integration of IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions. • The interoperability/integration of different IDS components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products.",
                "DIDSs (Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems) therefore started to emerge in early 90s [9] to allow the correlation of intrusion information from multiple hosts, networks or domains to detect distributed attacks.",
                "Research on DIDSs has then received much interest, mainly because centralised IDSs are not able to provide the information needed to prevent such attacks [13].",
                "However, the realization of a DIDS requires a high degree of coordination.",
                "Computational Grids are appealing as they enable the development of distributed application and coordination in a distributed environment.",
                "Grid computing aims to enable coordinate resource sharing in dynamic groups of individuals and/or organizations.",
                "Moreover, Grid middleware provides means for secure access, management and allocation of remote resources; resource information services; and protocols and mechanisms for transfer of data [4].",
                "According to Foster et al. [4], Grids can be viewed as a set of aggregate services defined by the resources that they share.",
                "OGSA (Open Grid Service Architecture) provides the foundation for this service orientation in computational Grids.",
                "The services in OGSA are specified through well-defined, open, extensible and platformindependent interfaces, which enable the development of interoperable applications.",

                "The proposed model enables heterogeneous IDSs to work in a cooperative way; this integration is termed DIDSoG (Distributed Intrusion Detection System on Grid).",
                "Each of the integrated IDSs is viewed by others as a resource accessed through the services that it exposes.",
                "A Grid middleware provides several features for the realization of a DIDSoG, including [3]: decentralized coordination of resources; use of standard protocols and interfaces; and the delivery of optimized QoS (Quality of Service).",

                "This characteristic is important for the integration of IDSs as the same service interfaces can be exposed by different IDSs.",
                "Grid middleware can thus be used to implement a great variety of services.",
                "Some functions provided by Grid middleware are [3]: (i) data management services, including access services, replication, and localisation; (ii) workflow services that implement coordinate execution of multiple applications on multiple resources; (iii) auditing services that perform the detection of frauds or intrusions; (iv) monitoring services which implement the discovery of sensors in a distributed environment and generate alerts under determined conditions; (v) services for identification of problems in a distributed environment, which implement the correlation of information from disparate and distributed logs.",

                "Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG (Intrusion Detection Working Group) from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) [12] as follows: • Many IDSs available in the market have strong and weak points, which generally make necessary the deployment of more than one IDS to provided an adequate solution. • Attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple networks spanning several administrative domains; these domains usually utilize different IDSs.",
                "The integration of IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions. • The interoperability/integration of different IDS components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products.",
                "DIDSs (Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems) therefore started to emerge in early 90s [9] to allow the correlation of intrusion information from multiple hosts, networks or domains to detect distributed attacks.",
                "Research on DIDSs has then received much interest, mainly because centralised IDSs are not able to provide the information needed to prevent such attacks [13].",

                "A Grid middleware is used for this integration.",
                "In addition, an architecture for this integration is proposed and validated through simulation.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Distributed Systes]: Client/Server, Distributed Applications. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Solutions for integrating heterogeneous IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems) have been proposed by several groups [6],[7],[11],[2].",
                "Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG (Intrusion Detection Working Group) from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) [12] as follows: • Many IDSs available in the market have strong and weak points, which generally make necessary the deployment of more than one IDS to provided an adequate solution. • Attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple networks spanning several administrative domains; these domains usually utilize different IDSs.",
                "The integration of IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions. • The interoperability/integration of different IDS components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products.",
                "DIDSs (Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems) therefore started to emerge in early 90s [9] to allow the correlation of intrusion information from multiple hosts, networks or domains to detect distributed attacks.",
                "Research on DIDSs has then received much interest, mainly because centralised IDSs are not able to provide the information needed to prevent such attacks [13].",
                "However, the realization of a DIDS requires a high degree of coordination.",
                "Computational Grids are appealing as they enable the development of distributed application and coordination in a distributed environment.",
                "Grid computing aims to enable coordinate resource sharing in dynamic groups of individuals and/or organizations.",
                "Moreover, Grid middleware provides means for secure access, management and allocation of remote resources; resource information services; and protocols and mechanisms for transfer of data [4].",
                "According to Foster et al. [4], Grids can be viewed as a set of aggregate services defined by the resources that they share.",
                "OGSA (Open Grid Service Architecture) provides the foundation for this service orientation in computational Grids.",
                "The services in OGSA are specified through well-defined, open, extensible and platformindependent interfaces, which enable the development of interoperable applications.",
                "This article proposes a model for integration of IDSs by using computational Grids.",
                "The proposed model enables heterogeneous IDSs to work in a cooperative way; this integration is termed DIDSoG (Distributed Intrusion Detection System on Grid).",
                "Each of the integrated IDSs is viewed by others as a resource accessed through the services that it exposes.",
                "A Grid middleware provides several features for the realization of a DIDSoG, including [3]: decentralized coordination of resources; use of standard protocols and interfaces; and the delivery of optimized QoS (Quality of Service).",
                "The service oriented architecture followed by Grids (OGSA) allows the definition of interfaces that are adaptable to different platforms.",
                "Different implementations can be encapsulated by a service interface; this virtualisation allows the consistent access to resources in heterogeneous environments [3].",
                "The virtualisation of the environment through service interfaces allows the use of services without the knowledge of how they are actually implemented.",
                "This characteristic is important for the integration of IDSs as the same service interfaces can be exposed by different IDSs.",
                "Grid middleware can thus be used to implement a great variety of services.",
                "Some functions provided by Grid middleware are [3]: (i) data management services, including access services, replication, and localisation; (ii) workflow services that implement coordinate execution of multiple applications on multiple resources; (iii) auditing services that perform the detection of frauds or intrusions; (iv) monitoring services which implement the discovery of sensors in a distributed environment and generate alerts under determined conditions; (v) services for identification of problems in a distributed environment, which implement the correlation of information from disparate and distributed logs.",
                "These services are important for the implementation of a DIDSoG.",
                "A DIDS needs services for the location of and access to distributed data from different IDSs.",
                "Auditing and monitoring services take care of the proper needs of the DIDSs such as: secure storage, data analysis to detect intrusions, discovery of distributed sensors, and sending of alerts.",
                "The correlation of distributed logs is also relevant because the detection of distributed attacks depends on the correlation of the alert information generated by the different IDSs that compose the DIDSoG.",

                "The integration of heterogeneous IDSs to increase the variety of intrusion detection techniques in the environment is mentioned as future work [13] DIDSoG thus aims at integrating heterogeneous IDSs [13].",
                "Ref. [10] presents a hierarchical architecture for a DIDS; information is collected, aggregated, correlated and analysed as it is sent up in the hierarchy.",

                "The integration proposed by DIDSoG also follows a hierarchical architecture.",
                "Each IDS integrated to the DIDSoG offers functionalities at a given level of the hierarchy and requests functionalities from IDSs from another level.",

                "The first phase aims at the detection of momentary attacks, while the second phase is concerned with chronic or perennial attacks.",
                "Traditional IDSs or DIDSs are generally coordinated by a central point; a characteristic that leaves them prone to attacks.",
                "Leu et al. [6] point out that IDSs developed upon Grids platforms are less vulnerable to attacks because of the distribution provided for such platforms.",
                "Leu et al. [6],[7] have used tools to generate several types of attacks - including TCP, ICMP and UDP flooding - and have demonstrated through experimental results the advantages of applying computational Grids to IDSs.",
                "This work proposes the development of a DIDS upon a Grid platform.",
                "However, the resulting DIDS integrates heterogeneous IDSs whereas the DIDSs upon Grids presented by Leu et al. [6][7] do not consider the integration of heterogeneous IDSs.",
                "The processing in phases [6][7] is also contemplated by DIDSoG, which is enabled by the specification of several levels of processing allowed by the integration of heterogeneous IDSs.",
                "The DIDS GIDA (Grid Intrusion Detection Architecture) targets at the detection of intrusions in a Grid environment [11].",

                "INTRODUCTION Solutions for integrating heterogeneous IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems) have been proposed by several groups [6],[7],[11],[2].",
                "Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG (Intrusion Detection Working Group) from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) [12] as follows: • Many IDSs available in the market have strong and weak points, which generally make necessary the deployment of more than one IDS to provided an adequate solution. • Attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple networks spanning several administrative domains; these domains usually utilize different IDSs.",
                "The integration of IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions. • The interoperability/integration of different IDS components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products.",
                "DIDSs (Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems) therefore started to emerge in early 90s [9] to allow the correlation of intrusion information from multiple hosts, networks or domains to detect distributed attacks.",
                "Research on DIDSs has then received much interest, mainly because centralised IDSs are not able to provide the information needed to prevent such attacks [13].",
                "However, the realization of a DIDS requires a high degree of coordination.",
                "Computational Grids are appealing as they enable the development of distributed application and coordination in a distributed environment.",
                "Grid computing aims to enable coordinate resource sharing in dynamic groups of individuals and/or organizations.",
                "Moreover, Grid middleware provides means for secure access, management and allocation of remote resources; resource information services; and protocols and mechanisms for transfer of data [4].",
                "According to Foster et al. [4], Grids can be viewed as a set of aggregate services defined by the resources that they share.",
                "OGSA (Open Grid Service Architecture) provides the foundation for this service orientation in computational Grids.",
                "The services in OGSA are specified through well-defined, open, extensible and platformindependent interfaces, which enable the development of interoperable applications.",

                "The proposed model enables heterogeneous IDSs to work in a cooperative way; this integration is termed DIDSoG (Distributed Intrusion Detection System on Grid).",
                "Each of the integrated IDSs is viewed by others as a resource accessed through the services that it exposes.",
                "A Grid middleware provides several features for the realization of a DIDSoG, including [3]: decentralized coordination of resources; use of standard protocols and interfaces; and the delivery of optimized QoS (Quality of Service).",

                "This characteristic is important for the integration of IDSs as the same service interfaces can be exposed by different IDSs.",
                "Grid middleware can thus be used to implement a great variety of services.",
                "Some functions provided by Grid middleware are [3]: (i) data management services, including access services, replication, and localisation; (ii) workflow services that implement coordinate execution of multiple applications on multiple resources; (iii) auditing services that perform the detection of frauds or intrusions; (iv) monitoring services which implement the discovery of sensors in a distributed environment and generate alerts under determined conditions; (v) services for identification of problems in a distributed environment, which implement the correlation of information from disparate and distributed logs.",

                "The integration of IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions. • The interoperability/integration of different IDS components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products.",

                "A Grid middleware is used for this integration.",
                "In addition, an architecture for this integration is proposed and validated through simulation.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Distributed Systes]: Client/Server, Distributed Applications. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Solutions for integrating heterogeneous IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems) have been proposed by several groups [6],[7],[11],[2].",
                "Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG (Intrusion Detection Working Group) from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) [12] as follows: • Many IDSs available in the market have strong and weak points, which generally make necessary the deployment of more than one IDS to provided an adequate solution. • Attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple networks spanning several administrative domains; these domains usually utilize different IDSs.",
                "The integration of IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions. • The interoperability/integration of different IDS components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products.",
                "DIDSs (Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems) therefore started to emerge in early 90s [9] to allow the correlation of intrusion information from multiple hosts, networks or domains to detect distributed attacks.",
                "Research on DIDSs has then received much interest, mainly because centralised IDSs are not able to provide the information needed to prevent such attacks [13].",
                "However, the realization of a DIDS requires a high degree of coordination.",
                "Computational Grids are appealing as they enable the development of distributed application and coordination in a distributed environment.",
                "Grid computing aims to enable coordinate resource sharing in dynamic groups of individuals and/or organizations.",
                "Moreover, Grid middleware provides means for secure access, management and allocation of remote resources; resource information services; and protocols and mechanisms for transfer of data [4].",
                "According to Foster et al. [4], Grids can be viewed as a set of aggregate services defined by the resources that they share.",
                "OGSA (Open Grid Service Architecture) provides the foundation for this service orientation in computational Grids.",
                "The services in OGSA are specified through well-defined, open, extensible and platformindependent interfaces, which enable the development of interoperable applications.",
                "This article proposes a model for integration of IDSs by using computational Grids.",
                "The proposed model enables heterogeneous IDSs to work in a cooperative way; this integration is termed DIDSoG (Distributed <br>intrusion detection system</br> on Grid).",
                "Each of the integrated IDSs is viewed by others as a resource accessed through the services that it exposes.",
                "A Grid middleware provides several features for the realization of a DIDSoG, including [3]: decentralized coordination of resources; use of standard protocols and interfaces; and the delivery of optimized QoS (Quality of Service).",
                "The service oriented architecture followed by Grids (OGSA) allows the definition of interfaces that are adaptable to different platforms.",
                "Different implementations can be encapsulated by a service interface; this virtualisation allows the consistent access to resources in heterogeneous environments [3].",
                "The virtualisation of the environment through service interfaces allows the use of services without the knowledge of how they are actually implemented.",
                "This characteristic is important for the integration of IDSs as the same service interfaces can be exposed by different IDSs.",
                "Grid middleware can thus be used to implement a great variety of services.",
                "Some functions provided by Grid middleware are [3]: (i) data management services, including access services, replication, and localisation; (ii) workflow services that implement coordinate execution of multiple applications on multiple resources; (iii) auditing services that perform the detection of frauds or intrusions; (iv) monitoring services which implement the discovery of sensors in a distributed environment and generate alerts under determined conditions; (v) services for identification of problems in a distributed environment, which implement the correlation of information from disparate and distributed logs.",
                "These services are important for the implementation of a DIDSoG.",
                "A DIDS needs services for the location of and access to distributed data from different IDSs.",
                "Auditing and monitoring services take care of the proper needs of the DIDSs such as: secure storage, data analysis to detect intrusions, discovery of distributed sensors, and sending of alerts.",
                "The correlation of distributed logs is also relevant because the detection of distributed attacks depends on the correlation of the alert information generated by the different IDSs that compose the DIDSoG.",

                "Traditional IDSs or DIDSs are generally coordinated by a central point; a characteristic that leaves them prone to attacks.",
                "Leu et al. [6] point out that IDSs developed upon Grids platforms are less vulnerable to attacks because of the distribution provided for such platforms.",
                "Leu et al. [6],[7] have used tools to generate several types of attacks - including TCP, ICMP and UDP flooding - and have demonstrated through experimental results the advantages of applying computational Grids to IDSs.",
                "This work proposes the development of a DIDS upon a Grid platform.",
                "However, the resulting DIDS integrates heterogeneous IDSs whereas the DIDSs upon Grids presented by Leu et al. [6][7] do not consider the integration of heterogeneous IDSs.",

                "Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG (Intrusion Detection Working Group) from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) [12] as follows: • Many IDSs available in the market have strong and weak points, which generally make necessary the deployment of more than one IDS to provided an adequate solution. • Attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple networks spanning several administrative domains; these domains usually utilize different IDSs.",
                "The integration of IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions. • The interoperability/integration of different IDS components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products.",
                "DIDSs (Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems) therefore started to emerge in early 90s [9] to allow the correlation of intrusion information from multiple hosts, networks or domains to detect distributed attacks.",
                "Research on DIDSs has then received much interest, mainly because centralised IDSs are not able to provide the information needed to prevent such attacks [13].",
                "However, the realization of a DIDS requires a high degree of coordination.",

                "INTRODUCTION Solutions for integrating heterogeneous IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems) have been proposed by several groups [6],[7],[11],[2].",
                "Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG (Intrusion Detection Working Group) from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) [12] as follows: • Many IDSs available in the market have strong and weak points, which generally make necessary the deployment of more than one IDS to provided an adequate solution. • Attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple networks spanning several administrative domains; these domains usually utilize different IDSs.",
                "The integration of IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions. • The interoperability/integration of different IDS components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products.",
                "DIDSs (Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems) therefore started to emerge in early 90s [9] to allow the correlation of intrusion information from multiple hosts, networks or domains to detect distributed attacks.",
                "Research on DIDSs has then received much interest, mainly because centralised IDSs are not able to provide the information needed to prevent such attacks [13].",
                "However, the realization of a DIDS requires a high degree of coordination.",
                "Computational Grids are appealing as they enable the development of distributed application and coordination in a distributed environment.",
                "Grid computing aims to enable coordinate resource sharing in dynamic groups of individuals and/or organizations.",
                "Moreover, Grid middleware provides means for secure access, management and allocation of remote resources; resource information services; and protocols and mechanisms for transfer of data [4].",
                "According to Foster et al. [4], Grids can be viewed as a set of aggregate services defined by the resources that they share.",
                "OGSA (Open Grid Service Architecture) provides the foundation for this service orientation in computational Grids.",
                "The services in OGSA are specified through well-defined, open, extensible and platformindependent interfaces, which enable the development of interoperable applications.",
                "This article proposes a model for integration of IDSs by using computational Grids.",
                "The proposed model enables heterogeneous IDSs to work in a cooperative way; this integration is termed DIDSoG (Distributed Intrusion Detection System on Grid).",
                "Each of the integrated IDSs is viewed by others as a resource accessed through the services that it exposes.",
                "A Grid middleware provides several features for the realization of a DIDSoG, including [3]: decentralized coordination of resources; use of standard protocols and interfaces; and the delivery of optimized QoS (Quality of Service).",
                "The service oriented architecture followed by Grids (OGSA) allows the definition of interfaces that are adaptable to different platforms.",
                "Different implementations can be encapsulated by a service interface; this virtualisation allows the consistent access to resources in heterogeneous environments [3].",
                "The virtualisation of the environment through service interfaces allows the use of services without the knowledge of how they are actually implemented.",
                "This characteristic is important for the integration of IDSs as the same service interfaces can be exposed by different IDSs.",
                "Grid middleware can thus be used to implement a great variety of services.",
                "Some functions provided by Grid middleware are [3]: (i) data management services, including access services, replication, and localisation; (ii) workflow services that implement coordinate execution of multiple applications on multiple resources; (iii) auditing services that perform the detection of frauds or intrusions; (iv) monitoring services which implement the discovery of sensors in a distributed environment and generate alerts under determined conditions; (v) services for identification of problems in a distributed environment, which implement the correlation of information from disparate and distributed logs.",
                "These services are important for the implementation of a DIDSoG.",
                "A DIDS needs services for the location of and access to distributed data from different IDSs.",
                "Auditing and monitoring services take care of the proper needs of the DIDSs such as: secure storage, data analysis to detect intrusions, discovery of distributed sensors, and sending of alerts.",
                "The correlation of distributed logs is also relevant because the detection of distributed attacks depends on the correlation of the alert information generated by the different IDSs that compose the DIDSoG.",

                "Each IDS integrated to the DIDSoG offers functionalities at a given level of the hierarchy and requests functionalities from IDSs from another level.",

                "Traditional IDSs or DIDSs are generally coordinated by a central point; a characteristic that leaves them prone to attacks.",
                "Leu et al. [6] point out that IDSs developed upon Grids platforms are less vulnerable to attacks because of the distribution provided for such platforms.",
                "Leu et al. [6],[7] have used tools to generate several types of attacks - including TCP, ICMP and UDP flooding - and have demonstrated through experimental results the advantages of applying computational Grids to IDSs.",
                "This work proposes the development of a DIDS upon a Grid platform.",
                "However, the resulting DIDS integrates heterogeneous IDSs whereas the DIDSs upon Grids presented by Leu et al. [6][7] do not consider the integration of heterogeneous IDSs.",
