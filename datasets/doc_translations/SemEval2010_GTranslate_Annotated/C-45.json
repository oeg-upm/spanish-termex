Stankovic Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia †Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota {stoleru, pv9f}@cs.virginia.edu, tianhe@cs.umn.edu, stankovic@cs.virginia.edu Abstract The problem of localization in wireless sensor networks where nodes do not use ranging hardware, remains a challenging problem, when considering the required location accuracy, energy expenditure and the duration of the localization phase. In this paper we propose a framework, called StarDust, for wireless sensor network localization based on passive optical components. In the StarDust framework, sensor nodes are equipped with optical retro-reflectors. An aerial device projects light towards the deployed sensor network, and records an image of the reflected light. An image processing algorithm is developed for obtaining the locations of sensor nodes. For matching a node ID to a location we propose a constraint-based label relaxation algorithm. We propose and develop localization techniques based on four types of constraints: node color, neighbor information, deployment time for a node and deployment location for a node. We evaluate the performance of a localization system based on our framework by localizing a network of 26 sensor nodes deployed in a 120 × 60 ft2 area. The localization accuracy ranges from 2 ft to 5 ft while the localization time ranges from 10 milliseconds to 2 minutes. Categories and Subject Descriptors: C.2.4 [Computer Communications Networks]: Distributed Systems; C.3 [Special Purpose and Application Based Systems]: Real-time and embedded systems General Terms: Algorithms, Measurement, Performance, Design, Experimentation 1 Introduction Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have been envisioned to revolutionize the way humans perceive and interact with the surrounding environment. One vision is to embed tiny sensor devices in outdoor environments, by aerial deployments from unmanned air vehicles. The sensor nodes form a network and collaborate (to compensate for the extremely scarce resources available to each of them: computational power, memory size, communication capabilities) to accomplish the mission. Through collaboration, redundancy and fault tolerance, the WSN is then able to achieve unprecedented sensing capabilities. A major step forward has been accomplished by developing systems for several domains: military surveillance [1] [2] [3], habitat monitoring [4] and structural monitoring [5]. Even after these successes, several research problems remain open. Among these open problems is sensor node localization, i.e., how to find the physical position of each sensor node. Despite the attention the localization problem in WSN has received, no universally acceptable solution has been developed. There are several reasons for this. On one hand, localization schemes that use ranging are typically high end solutions. GPS ranging hardware consumes energy, it is relatively expensive (if high accuracy is required) and poses form factor challenges that move us away from the vision of dust size sensor nodes. Ultrasound has a short range and is highly directional. Solutions that use the radio transceiver for ranging either have not produced encouraging results (if the received signal strength indicator is used) or are sensitive to environment (e.g., multipath). On the other hand, localization schemes that only use the connectivity information for inferring location information are characterized by low accuracies: ≈ 10 ft in controlled environments, 40−50 ft in realistic ones. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for WSN localization, called StarDust, in which the complexity associated with the node localization is completely removed from the sensor node. The basic principle of the framework is localization through passivity: each sensor node is equipped with a corner-cube retro-reflector and possibly an optical filter (a coloring device). An aerial vehicle projects light onto the deployment area and records images containing retro-reflected light beams (they appear as luminous spots). Through image processing techniques, the locations of the retro-reflectors (i.e., sensor nodes) is deter57 mined. For inferring the identity of the sensor node present at a particular location, the StarDust framework develops a constraint-based node ID relaxation algorithm. The main contributions of our work are the following. We propose a novel framework for node localization in WSNs that is very promising and allows for many future extensions and more accurate results. We propose a constraint-based label relaxation algorithm for mapping node IDs to the locations, and four constraints (node, connectivity, time and space), which are building blocks for very accurate and very fast localization systems. We develop a sensor node hardware prototype, called a SensorBall. We evaluate the performance of a localization system for which we obtain location accuracies of 2 − 5 ft with a localization duration ranging from 10 milliseconds to 2 minutes. We investigate the range of a system built on our framework by considering realities of physical phenomena that occurs during light propagation through the atmosphere. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 is an overview of the state of art. The design of the StarDust framework is presented in Section 3. One implementation and its performance evaluation are in Sections 4 and 5, followed by a suite of system optimization techniques, in Section 6. In Section 7 we present our conclusions. 2 Related Work We present the prior work in localization in two major categories: the range-based, and the range-free schemes. The range-based localization techniques have been designed to use either more expensive hardware (and hence higher accuracy) or just the radio transceiver. Ranging techniques dependent on hardware are the time-of-flight (ToF) and the time-difference-of-arrival(TDoA). Solutions that use the radio are based on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and more recently on radio interferometry. The ToF localization technique that is most widely used is the GPS. GPS is a costly solution for a high accuracy localization of a large scale sensor network. AHLoS [6] employs a TDoA ranging technique that requires extensive hardware and solves relatively large nonlinear systems of equations. The Cricket location-support system (TDoA) [7] can achieve a location granularity of tens of inches with highly directional and short range ultrasound transceivers. In [2] the location of a sniper is determined in an urban terrain, by using the TDoA between an acoustic wave and a radio beacon. The PushPin project [8] uses the TDoA between ultrasound pulses and light flashes for node localization. The RADAR system [9] uses the RSSI to build a map of signal strengths as emitted by a set of beacon nodes. A mobile node is located by the best match, in the signal strength space, with a previously acquired signature. In MAL [10], a mobile node assists in measuring the distances (acting as constraints) between nodes until a rigid graph is generated. The localization problem is formulated as an on-line state estimation in a nonlinear dynamic system [11]. A cooperative ranging that attempts to achieve a global positioning from distributed local optimizations is proposed in [12]. A very recent, remarkable, localization technique is based on radio interferometry, RIPS [13], which utilizes two transmitters to create an interfering signal. The frequencies of the emitters are very close to each other, thus the interfering signal will have a low frequency envelope that can be easily measured. The ranging technique performs very well. The long time required for localization and multi-path environments pose significant challenges. Real environments create additional challenges for the range based localization schemes. These have been emphasized by several studies [14] [15] [16]. To address these challenges, and others (hardware cost, the energy expenditure, the form factor, the small range, localization time), several range-free localization schemes have been proposed. Sensor nodes use primarily connectivity information for inferring proximity to a set of anchors. In the Centroid localization scheme [17], a sensor node localizes to the centroid of its proximate beacon nodes. In APIT [18] each node decides its position based on the possibility of being inside or outside of a triangle formed by any three beacons within nodes communication range. The Gradient algorithm [19], leverages the knowledge about the network density to infer the average one hop length. This, in turn, can be transformed into distances to nodes with known locations. DV-Hop [20] uses the hop by hop propagation capability of the network to forward distances to landmarks. More recently, several localization schemes that exploit the sensing capabilities of sensor nodes, have been proposed. Spotlight [21] creates well controlled (in time and space) events in the network while the sensor nodes detect and timestamp this events. From the spatiotemporal knowledge for the created events and the temporal information provided by sensor nodes, nodes spatial information can be obtained. In a similar manner, the Lighthouse system [22] uses a parallel light beam, that is emitted by an anchor which rotates with a certain period. A sensor node detects the light beam for a period of time, which is dependent on the distance between it and the light emitting device. Many of the above localization solutions target specific sets of requirements and are useful for specific applications. StarDust differs in that it addresses a particular demanding set of requirements that are not yet solved well. StarDust is meant for localizing air dropped nodes where node passiveness, high accuracy, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are all required. Many military applications have such requirements. 3 StarDust System Design The design of the StarDust system (and its name) was inspired by the similarity between a deployed sensor network, in which sensor nodes indicate their presence by emitting light, and the Universe consisting of luminous and illuminated objects: stars, galaxies, planets, etc. The main difficulty when applying the above ideas to the real world is the complexity of the hardware that needs to be put on a sensor node so that the emitted light can be detected from thousands of feet. The energy expenditure for producing an intense enough light beam is also prohibitive. Instead, what we propose to use for sensor node localization is a passive optical element called a retro-reflector. The most common retro-reflective optical component is a Corner-Cube Retroreflector (CCR), shown in Figure 1(a). It consists of three mutually perpendicular mirrors. The inter58 (a) (b) Figure 1. Corner-Cube Retroreflector (a) and an array of CCRs molded in plastic (b) esting property of this optical component is that an incoming beam of light is reflected back, towards the source of the light, irrespective of the angle of incidence. This is in contrast with a mirror, which needs to be precisely positioned to be perpendicular to the incident light. A very common and inexpensive implementation of an array of CCRs is the retroreflective plastic material used on cars and bicycles for night time detection, shown in Figure 1(b). In the StarDust system, each node is equipped with a small (e.g. 0.5in2) array of CCRs and the enclosure has self-righting capabilities that orient the array of CCRs predominantly upwards. It is critical to understand that the upward orientation does not need to be exact. Even when large angular variations from a perfectly upward orientation are present, a CCR will return the light in the exact same direction from which it came. In the remaining part of the section, we present the architecture of the StarDust system and the design of its main components. 3.1 System Architecture The envisioned sensor network localization scenario is as follows: • The sensor nodes are released, possibly in a controlled manner, from an aerial vehicle during the night. • The aerial vehicle hovers over the deployment area and uses a strobe light to illuminate it. The sensor nodes, equipped with CCRs and optical filters (acting as coloring devices) have self-righting capabilities and retroreflect the incoming strobe light. The retro-reflected light is either white, as the originating source light, or colored, due to optical filters. • The aerial vehicle records a sequence of two images very close in time (msec level). One image is taken when the strobe light is on, the other when the strobe light is off. The acquired images are used for obtaining the locations of sensor nodes (which appear as luminous spots in the image). • The aerial vehicle executes the mapping of node IDs to the identified locations in one of the following ways: a) by using the color of a retro-reflected light, if a sensor node has a unique color; b) by requiring sensor nodes to establish neighborhood information and report it to a base station; c) by controlling the time sequence of sensor nodes deployment and recording additional imLight Emitter Sensor Node i Transfer Function Φi(λ) Ψ(λ) Φ(Ψ(λ)) Image Processing Node ID Matching Radio Model R G(Λ,E) Central Device V V Figure 2. The StarDust system architecture ages; d) by controlling the location where a sensor node is deployed. • The computed locations are disseminated to the sensor network. The architecture of the StarDust system is shown in Figure 2. The architecture consists of two main components: the first is centralized and it is located on a more powerful device. The second is distributed and it resides on all sensor nodes. The Central Device consists of the following: the Light Emitter, the Image Processing module, the Node ID Mapping module and the Radio Model. The distributed component of the architecture is the Transfer Function, which acts as a filter for the incoming light. The aforementioned modules are briefly described below: • Light Emitter - It is a strobe light, capable of producing very intense, collimated light pulses. The emitted light is non-monochromatic (unlike a laser) and it is characterized by a spectral density Ψ(λ), a function of the wavelength. The emitted light is incident on the CCRs present on sensor nodes. • Transfer Function Φ(Ψ(λ)) - This is a bandpass filter for the incident light on the CCR. The filter allows a portion of the original spectrum, to be retro-reflected. From here on, we will refer to the transfer function as the color of a sensor node. • Image Processing - The Image Processing module acquires high resolution images. From these images the locations and the colors of sensor nodes are obtained. If only one set of pictures can be taken (i.e., one location of the light emitter/image analysis device), then the map of the field is assumed to be known as well as the distance between the imaging device and the field. The aforementioned assumptions (field map and distance to it) are not necessary if the images can be simultaneously taken from different locations. It is important to remark here that the identity of a node can not be directly obtained through Image Processing alone, unless a specific characteristic of a sensor node can be identified in the image. • Node ID Matching - This module uses the detected locations and through additional techniques (e.g., sensor node coloring and connectivity information (G(Λ,E)) from the deployed network) to uniquely identify the sensor nodes observed in the image. The connectivity information is represented by neighbor tables sent from 59 Algorithm 1 Image Processing 1: Background filtering 2: Retro-reflected light recognition through intensity filtering 3: Edge detection to obtain the location of sensor nodes 4: Color identification for each detected sensor node each sensor node to the Central Device. • Radio Model - This component provides an estimate of the radio range to the Node ID Matching module. It is only used by node ID matching techniques that are based on the radio connectivity in the network. The estimate of the radio range R is based on the sensor node density (obtained through the Image Processing module) and the connectivity information (i.e., G(Λ,E)). The two main components of the StarDust architecture are the Image Processing and the Node ID Mapping. Their design and analysis is presented in the sections that follow. 3.2 Image Processing The goal of the Image Processing Algorithm (IPA) is to identify the location of the nodes and their color. Note that IPA does not identify which node fell where, but only what is the set of locations where the nodes fell. IPA is executed after an aerial vehicle records two pictures: one in which the field of deployment is illuminated and one when no illuminations is present. Let Pdark be the picture of the deployment area, taken when no light was emitted and Plight be the picture of the same deployment area when a strong light beam was directed towards the sensor nodes. The proposed IPA has several steps, as shown in Algorithm 1. The first step is to obtain a third picture Pfilter where only the differences between Pdark and Plight remain. Let us assume that Pdark has a resolution of n × m, where n is the number of pixels in a row of the picture, while m is the number of pixels in a column of the picture. Then Pdark is composed of n × m pixels noted Pdark(i, j), i ∈ 1 ≤ i ≤ n,1 ≤ j ≤ m. Similarly Plight is composed of n × m pixels noted Plight(i, j), 1 ≤ i ≤ n,1 ≤ j ≤ m. Each pixel P is described by an RGB value where the R value is denoted by PR, the G value is denoted by PG, and the B value is denoted by PB. IPA then generates the third picture, Pfilter, through the following transformations: PR filter(i, j) = PR light(i, j)−PR dark(i, j) PG filter(i, j) = PG light(i, j)−PG dark(i, j) PB filter(i, j) = PB light(i, j)−PB dark(i, j) (1) After this transformation, all the features that appeared in both Pdark and Plight are removed from Pfilter. This simplifies the recognition of light retro-reflected by sensor nodes. The second step consists of identifying the elements contained in Pfilter that retro-reflect light. For this, an intensity filter is applied to Pfilter. First IPA converts Pfilter into a grayscale picture. Then the brightest pixels are identified and used to create Preflect. This step is eased by the fact that the reflecting nodes should appear much brighter than any other illuminated object in the picture. Support: Q(λk) ni P1 ... P2 ... PN λ1 ... λk ... λN Figure 3. Probabilistic label relaxation The third step runs an edge detection algorithm on Preflect to identify the boundary of the nodes present. A tool such as Matlab provides a number of edge detection techniques. We used the bwboundaries function. For the obtained edges, the location (x,y) (in the image) of each node is determined by computing the centroid of the points constituting its edges. Standard computer graphics techniques [23] are then used to transform the 2D locations of sensor nodes detected in multiple images into 3D sensor node locations. The color of the node is obtained as the color of the pixel located at (x,y) in Plight. 3.3 Node ID Matching The goal of the Node ID Matching module is to obtain the identity (node ID) of a luminous spot in the image, detected to be a sensor node. For this, we define V = {(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(xm,ym)} to be the set of locations of the sensor nodes, as detected by the Image Processing module and Λ = {λ1,λ2,...,λm} to be the set of unique node IDs assigned to the m sensor nodes, before deployment. From here on, we refer to node IDs as labels. We model the problem of finding the label λj of a node ni as a probabilistic label relaxation problem, frequently used in image processing/understanding. In the image processing domain, scene labeling (i.e., identifying objects in an image) plays a major role. The goal of scene labeling is to assign a label to each object detected in an image, such that an appropriate image interpretation is achieved. It is prohibitively expensive to consider the interactions among all the objects in an image. Instead, constraints placed among nearby objects generate local consistencies and through iteration, global consistencies can be obtained. The main idea of the sensor node localization through probabilistic label relaxation is to iteratively compute the probability of each label being the correct label for a sensor node, by taking into account, at each iteration, the support for a label. The support for a label can be understood as a hint or proof, that a particular label is more likely to be the correct one, when compared with the other potential labels for a sensor node. We pictorially depict this main idea in Figure 3. As shown, node ni has a set of candidate labels {λ1,...,λk}. Each of the labels has a different value for the Support function Q(λk). We defer the explanation of how the Support function is implemented until the subsections that follow, where we provide four concrete techniques. Formally, the algorithm is outlined in Algorithm 2, where the equations necessary for computing the new probability Pni(λk) for a label λk of a node ni, are expressed by the 60 Algorithm 2 Label Relaxation 1: for each sensor node ni do 2: assign equal prob. to all possible labels 3: end for 4: repeat 5: converged ← true 6: for each sensor node ni do 7: for each each label λj of ni do 8: compute the Support label λj: Equation 4 9: end for 10: compute K for the node ni: Equation 3 11: for each each label λj do 12: update probability of label λj: Equation 2 13: if |new prob.−old prob.| ≥ ε then 14: converged ← false 15: end if 16: end for 17: end for 18: until converged = true following equations: Ps+1 ni (λk) = 1 Kni Ps ni (λk)Qs ni (λk) (2) where Kni is a normalizing constant, given by: Kni = N ∑ k=1 Ps ni (λk)Qs ni (λk) (3) and Qs ni (λk) is: Qs ni (λk) = support for label λk of node ni (4) The label relaxation algorithm is iterative and it is polynomial in the size of the network(number of nodes). The pseudo-code is shown in Algorithm 2. It initializes the probabilities associated with each possible label, for a node ni, through a uniform distribution. At each iteration s, the algorithm updates the probability associated with each label, by considering the Support Qs ni (λk) for each candidate label of a sensor node. In the sections that follow, we describe four different techniques for implementing the Support function: based on node coloring, radio connectivity, the time of deployment (time) and the location of deployment (space). While some of these techniques are simplistic, they are primitives which, when combined, can create powerful localization systems. These design techniques have different trade-offs, which we will present in Section 3.3.6. 3.3.1 Relaxation with Color Constraints The unique mapping between a sensor nodes position (identified by the image processing) and a label can be obtained by assigning a unique color to each sensor node. For this we define C = {c1,c2,...,cn} to be the set of unique colors available and M : Λ → C to be a one-to-one mapping of labels to colors. This mapping is known prior to the sensor node deployment (from node manufacturing). In the case of color constrained label relaxation, the support for label λk is expressed as follows: Qs ni (λk) = 1 (5) As a result, the label relaxation algorithm (Algorithm 2) consists of the following steps: one label is assigned to each sensor node (lines 1-3 of the algorithm), implicitly having a probability Pni(λk) = 1 ; the algorithm executes a single iteration, when the support function, simply, reiterates the confidence in the unique labeling. However, it is often the case that unique colors for each node will not be available. It is interesting to discuss here the influence that the size of the coloring space (i.e., |C|) has on the accuracy of the localization algorithm. Several cases are discussed below: • If |C| = 0, no colors are used and the sensor nodes are equipped with simple CCRs that reflect back all the incoming light (i.e., no filtering, and no coloring of the incoming light). From the image processing system, the position of sensor nodes can still be obtained. Since all nodes appear white, no single sensor node can be uniquely identified. • If |C| = m − 1 then there are enough unique colors for all nodes (one node remains white, i.e. no coloring), the problem is trivially solved. Each node can be identified, based on its unique color. This is the scenario for the relaxation with color constraints. • If |C| ≥ 1, there are several options for how to partition the coloring space. If C = {c1} one possibility is to assign the color c1 to a single node, and leave the remaining m−1 sensor nodes white, or to assign the color c1 to more than one sensor node. One can observe that once a color is assigned uniquely to a sensor node, in effect, that sensor node is given the status of anchor, or node with known location. It is interesting to observe that there is an entire spectrum of possibilities for how to partition the set of sensor nodes in equivalence classes (where an equivalence class is represented by one color), in order to maximize the success of the localization algorithm. One of the goals of this paper is to understand how the size of the coloring space and its partitioning affect localization accuracy. Despite the simplicity of this method of constraining the set of labels that can be assigned to a node, we will show that this technique is very powerful, when combined with other relaxation techniques. 3.3.2 Relaxation with Connectivity Constraints Connectivity information, obtained from the sensor network through beaconing, can provide additional information for locating sensor nodes. In order to gather connectivity information, the following need to occur: 1) after deployment, through beaconing of HELLO messages, sensor nodes build their neighborhood tables; 2) each node sends its neighbor table information to the Central device via a base station. First, let us define G = (Λ,E) to be the weighted connectivity graph built by the Central device from the received neighbor table information. In G the edge (λi,λj) has a 61 λ1 λ2 ... λN ni nj gi2,j2 λ1 λ2 ... λN Pj,λ1 Pj,λ2 ... Pj,λN Pi,λ1 Pi,λ1 ... Pi,λN gi2,jm Figure 4. Label relaxation with connectivity constraints weight gij represented by the number of beacons sent by λj and received by λi. In addition, let R be the radio range of the sensor nodes. The main idea of the connectivity constrained label relaxation is depicted in Figure 4 in which two nodes ni and nj have been assigned all possible labels. The confidence in each of the candidate labels for a sensor node, is represented by a probability, shown in a dotted rectangle. It is important to remark that through beaconing and the reporting of neighbor tables to the Central Device, a global view of all constraints in the network can be obtained. It is critical to observe that these constraints are among labels. As shown in Figure 4 two constraints exist between nodes ni and nj. The constraints are depicted by gi2,j2 and gi2,jM, the number of beacons sent the labels λj2 and λjM and received by the label λi2. The support for the label λk of sensor node ni, resulting from the interaction (i.e., within radio range) with sensor node nj is given by: Qs ni (λk) = M ∑ m=1 gλkλm Ps nj (λm) (6) As a result, the localization algorithm (Algorithm 3 consists of the following steps: all labels are assigned to each sensor node (lines 1-3 of the algorithm), and implicitly each label has a probability initialized to Pni(λk) = 1/|Λ|; in each iteration, the probabilities for the labels of a sensor node are updated, when considering the interaction with the labels of sensor nodes within R. It is important to remark that the identity of the nodes within R is not known, only the candidate labels and their probabilities. The relaxation algorithm converges when, during an iteration, the probability of no label is updated by more than ε. The label relaxation algorithm based on connectivity constraints, enforces such constraints between pairs of sensor nodes. For a large scale sensor network deployment, it is not feasible to consider all pairs of sensor nodes in the network. Hence, the algorithm should only consider pairs of sensor nodes that are within a reasonable communication range (R). We assume a circular radio range and a symmetric connectivity. In the remaining part of the section we propose a simple analytical model that estimates the radio range R for medium-connected networks (less than 20 neighbors per R). We consider the following to be known: the size of the deployment field (L), the number of sensor nodes deployed (N) Algorithm 3 Localization 1: Estimate the radio range R 2: Execute the Label Relaxation Algorithm with Support Function given by Equation 6 for neighbors less than R apart 3: for each sensor node ni do 4: node identity is λk with max. prob. 5: end for and the total number of unidirectional (i.e., not symmetric) one-hop radio connections in the network (k). For our analysis, we uniformly distribute the sensor nodes in a square area of length L, by using a grid of unit length L/ √ N. We use the substitution u = L/ √ N to simplify the notation, in order to distinguish the following cases: if u ≤ R ≤ √ 2u each node has four neighbors (the expected k = 4N); if √ 2u ≤ R ≤ 2u each node has eight neighbors (the expected k = 8N); if 2u ≤ R ≤ √ 5u each node has twelve neighbors ( the expected k = 12N); if √ 5u ≤ R ≤ 3u each node has twenty neighbors (the expected k = 20N) For a given t = k/4N we take R to be the middle of the interval. As an example, if t = 5 then R = (3 + √ 5)u/2. A quadratic fitting for R over the possible values of t, produces the following closed-form solution for the communication range R, as a function of network connectivity k, assuming L and N constant: R(k) = L √ N −0.051 k 4N 2 +0.66 k 4N +0.6 (7) We investigate the accuracy of our model in Section 5.2.1. 3.3.3 Relaxation with Time Constraints Time constraints can be treated similarly with color constraints. The unique identification of a sensor node can be obtained by deploying sensor nodes individually, one by one, and recording a sequence of images. The sensor node that is identified as new in the last picture (it was not identified in the picture before last) must be the last sensor node dropped. In a similar manner with color constrained label relaxation, the time constrained approach is very simple, but may take too long, especially for large scale systems. While it can be used in practice, it is unlikely that only a time constrained label relaxation is used. As we will see, by combining constrained-based primitives, realistic localization systems can be implemented. The support function for the label relaxation with time constraints is defined identically with the color constrained relaxation: Qs ni (λk) = 1 (8) The localization algorithm (Algorithm 2 consists of the following steps: one label is assigned to each sensor node (lines 1-3 of the algorithm), and implicitly having a probability Pni(λk) = 1 ; the algorithm executes a single iteration, 62 D1 D2 D4 D 3Node Label-1 Label-2 Label-3 Label-4 0.2 0.1 0.5 0.2 Figure 5.

Distribution of nodes when the support function, simply, reiterates the confidence in the unique labeling. 3.3.4 Relaxation with Space Constraints Spatial information related to sensor deployment can also be employed as another input to the label relaxation algorithm. To do that, we use two types of locations: the node location pn and the label location pl. The former pn is defined as the position of nodes (xn,yn,zn) after deployment, which can be obtained through Image Processing as mentioned in Section 3.3. The latter pl is defined as the location (xl,yl,zl) where a node is dropped. We use Dni λm to denote the horizontal distance between the location of the label λm and the location of the node ni. Clearly, Dni λm = (xn −xl)2 +(yn −yl)2. At the time of a sensor node release, the one-to-one mapping between the node and its label is known. In other words, the label location is the same as the node location at the release time. After release, the label location information is partially lost due to the random factors such as wind and surface impact. However, statistically, the node locations are correlated with label locations. Such correlation depends on the airdrop methods employed and environments. For the sake of simplicity, lets assume nodes are dropped from the air through a helicopter hovering in the air. Wind can be decomposed into three components X,Y and Z. Only X and Y affect the horizontal distance a node can travel. According to [24], we can assume that X and Y follow an independent normal distribution. Therefore, the absolute value of the wind speed follows a Rayleigh distribution. Obviously the higher the wind speed is, the further a node would land away horizontally from the label location. If we assume that the distance D is a function of the wind speed V [25] [26], we can obtain the probability distribution of D under a given wind speed distribution. Without loss of generality, we assume that D is proportional to the wind speed. Therefore, D follows the Rayleigh distribution as well. As shown in Figure 5, the spatial-based relaxation is a recursive process to assign the probability that a nodes has a certain label by using the distances between the location of a node with multiple label locations. We note that the distribution of distance D affects the probability with which a label is assigned. It is not necessarily true that the nearest label is always chosen. For example, if D follows the Rayleigh(σ2) distribution, we can obtain the Probability Density Function (PDF) of distances as shown in Figure 6. This figure indicates that the possibility of a node to fall vertically is very small under windy conditions (σ > 0), and that the distance D is affected by the σ. The spatial distribution of nodes for σ = 1 is shown in Figure 7. Strong wind with a high σ value leads to a larger node dispersion. More formally, given a probability density function PDF(D), the support for label λk of sensor node ni can be formulated as: Qs ni (λk) = PDF(Dni λk ) (9) It is interesting to point out two special cases. First, if all nodes are released at once (i.e., only one label location for all released nodes), the distance D from a node to all labels is the same. In this case, Ps+1 ni (λk) = Ps ni (λk), which indicates that we can not use the spatial-based relaxation to recursively narrow down the potential labels for a node. Second, if nodes are released at different locations that are far away from each other, we have: (i) If node ni has label λk, Ps ni (λk) → 1 when s → ∞, (ii) If node ni does not have label λk, Ps ni (λk) → 0 when s → ∞. In this second scenario, there are multiple labels (one label per release), hence it is possible to correlate release times (labels) with positions on the ground. These results indicate that spatial-based relaxation can label the node with a very high probability if the physical separation among nodes is large. 3.3.5 Relaxation with Color and Connectivity Constraints One of the most interesting features of the StarDust architecture is that it allows for hybrid localization solutions to be built, depending on the system requirements. One example is a localization system that uses the color and connectivity constraints. In this scheme, the color constraints are used for reducing the number of candidate labels for sensor nodes, to a more manageable value. As a reminder, in the connectivity constrained relaxation, all labels are candidate labels for each sensor node. The color constraints are used in the initialization phase of Algorithm 3 (lines 1-3). After the initialization, the standard connectivity constrained relaxation algorithm is used. For a better understanding of how the label relaxation algorithm works, we give a concrete example, exemplified in Figure 8. In part (a) of the figure we depict the data structures 63 11 8 4 1 12 9 7 5 3 ni nj 12 8 10 11 10 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 (a) 11 8 4 1 12 9 7 5 3 ni nj 12 8 10 11 10 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.32 0 0.68 0 (b) Figure 8. A step through the algorithm. After initialization (a) and after the 1st iteration for node ni (b) associated with nodes ni and nj after the initialization steps of the algorithm (lines 1-6), as well as the number of beacons between different labels (as reported by the network, through G(Λ,E)). As seen, the potential labels (shown inside the vertical rectangles) are assigned to each node. Node ni can be any of the following: 11,8,4,1. Also depicted in the figure are the probabilities associated with each of the labels. After initialization, all probabilities are equal. Part (b) of Figure 8 shows the result of the first iteration of the localization algorithm for node ni, assuming that node nj is the first wi chosen in line 7 of Algorithm 3. By using Equation 6, the algorithm computes the support Q(λi) for each of the possible labels for node ni. Once the Q(λi)s are computed, the normalizing constant, given by Equation 3 can be obtained. The last step of the iteration is to update the probabilities associated with all potential labels of node ni, as given by Equation 2. One interesting problem, which we explore in the performance evaluation section, is to assess the impact the partitioning of the color set C has on the accuracy of localization. When the size of the coloring set is smaller than the number of sensor nodes (as it is the case for our hybrid connectivity/color constrained relaxation), the system designer has the option of allowing one node to uniquely have a color (acting as an anchor), or multiple nodes. Intuitively, by assigning one color to more than one node, more constraints (distributed) can be enforced. 3.3.6 Relaxation Techniques Analysis The proposed label relaxation techniques have different trade-offs. For our analysis of the trade-offs, we consider the following metrics of interest: the localization time (duration), the energy consumed (overhead), the network size (scale) that can be handled by the technique and the localization accuracy. The parameters of interest are the following: the number of sensor nodes (N), the energy spent for one aerial drop (εd), the energy spent in the network for collecting and reporting neighbor information εb and the time Td taken by a sensor node to reach the ground after being aerially deployed. The cost comparison of the different label relaxation techniques is shown in Table 1. As shown, the relaxation techniques based on color and space constraints have the lowest localization duration, zero, for all practical purposes. The scalability of the color based relaxation technique is, however, limited to the number of (a) (b) Figure 9. SensorBall with self-righting capabilities (a) and colored CCRs (b) unique color filters that can be built. The narrower the Transfer Function Ψ(λ), the larger the number of unique colors that can be created. The manufacturing costs, however, are increasing as well. The scalability issue is addressed by all other label relaxation techniques. Most notably, the time constrained relaxation, which is very similar to the colorconstrained relaxation, addresses the scale issue, at a higher deployment cost.

Comparison of label relaxation techniques 4 System Implementation The StarDust localization framework, depicted in Figure 2, is flexible in that it enables the development of new localization systems, based on the four proposed label relaxation schemes, or the inclusion of other, yet to be invented, schemes. For our performance evaluation we implemented a version of the StarDust framework, namely the one proposed in Section 3.3.5, where the constraints are based on color and connectivity. The Central device of the StarDust system consists of the following: the Light Emitter - we used a common-off-theshelf flash light (QBeam, 3 million candlepower); the image acquisition was done with a 3 megapixel digital camera (Sony DSC-S50) which provided the input to the Image Processing algorithm, implemented in Matlab. For sensor nodes we built a custom sensor node, called SensorBall, with self-righting capabilities, shown in Figure 9(a). The self-righting capabilities are necessary in order to orient the CCR predominantly upwards. The CCRs that we used were inexpensive, plastic molded, night time warning signs commonly available on bicycles, as shown in Figure 9(b). We remark here the low quality of the CCRs we used. The reflectivity of each CCR (there are tens molded in the plastic container) is extremely low, and each CCR is not built with mirrors. A reflective effect is achieved by employing finely polished plastic surfaces. We had 5 colors available, in addition to the standard CCR, which reflects all the incoming light (white CCR). For a slightly higher price (ours were 20cents/piece), better quality CCRs can be employed. 64 Figure 10. The field in the dark Figure 11. The illuminated field Figure 12. The difference: Figure 10Figure 11 Higher quality (better mirrors) would translate in more accurate image processing (better sensor node detection) and smaller form factor for the optical component (an array of CCRs with a smaller area can be used). The sensor node platform we used was the micaZ mote. The code that runs on each node is a simple application which broadcasts 100 beacons, and maintains a neighbor table containing the percentage of successfully received beacons, for each neighbor. On demand, the neighbor table is reported to a base station, where the node ID mapping is performed. 5 System Evaluation In this section we present the performance evaluation of a system implementation of the StarDust localization framework. The three major research questions that our evaluation tries to answer are: the feasibility of the proposed framework (can sensor nodes be optically detected at large distances), the localization accuracy of one actual implementation of the StarDust framework, and whether or not atmospheric conditions can affect the recognition of sensor nodes in an image. The first two questions are investigated by evaluating the two main components of the StarDust framework: the Image Processing and the Node ID Matching. These components have been evaluated separately mainly because of lack of adequate facilities. We wanted to evaluate the performance of the Image Processing Algorithm in a long range, realistic, experimental set-up, while the Node ID Matching required a relatively large area, available for long periods of time (for connectivity data gathering). The third research question is investigated through a computer modeling of atmospheric phenomena. For the evaluation of the Image Processing module, we performed experiments in a football stadium where we deploy 6 sensor nodes in a 3×2 grid. The distance between the Central device and the sensor nodes is approximately 500 ft. The metrics of interest are the number of false positives and false negatives in the Image Processing Algorithm. For the evaluation of the Node ID Mapping component, we deploy 26 sensor nodes in an 120 × 60 ft2 flat area of a stadium. In order to investigate the influence the radio connectivity has on localization accuracy, we vary the height above ground of the deployed sensor nodes. Two set-ups are used: one in which the sensor nodes are on the ground, and the second one, in which the sensor nodes are raised 3 inches above ground. From here on, we will refer to these two experimental set-ups as the low connectivity and the high connectivity networks, respectively because when nodes are on the ground the communication range is low resulting in less neighbors than when the nodes are elevated and have a greater communication range. The metrics of interest are: the localization error (defined as the distance between the computed location and the true location - known from the manual placement), the percentage of nodes correctly localized, the convergence of the label relaxation algorithm, the time to localize and the robustness of the node ID mapping to errors in the Image Processing module. The parameters that we vary experimentally are: the angle under which images are taken, the focus of the camera, and the degree of connectivity. The parameters that we vary in simulations (subsequent to image acquisition and connectivity collection) the number of colors, the number of anchors, the number of false positives or negatives as input to the Node ID Matching component, the distance between the imaging device and sensor network (i.e., range), atmospheric conditions (light attenuation coefficient) and CCR reflectance (indicative of its quality). 5.1 Image Processing For the IPA evaluation, we deploy 6 sensor nodes in a 3 × 2 grid. We take 13 sets of pictures using different orientations of the camera and different zooming factors. All pictures were taken from the same location. Each set is composed of a picture taken in the dark and of a picture taken with a light beam pointed at the nodes. We process the pictures offline using a Matlab implementation of IPA. Since we are interested in the feasibility of identifying colored sensor nodes at large distance, the end result of our IPA is the 2D location of sensor nodes (position in the image). The transformation to 3D coordinates can be done through standard computer graphics techniques [23]. One set of pictures obtained as part of our experiment is shown in Figures 10 and 11. The execution of our IPA algorithm results in Figure 12 which filters out the background, and Figure 13 which shows the output of the edge detection step of IPA. The experimental results are depicted in Figure 14. For each set of pictures the graph shows the number of false positives (the IPA determines that there is a node 65 Figure 13. Retroreflectors detected in Figure 12 0 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Experiment Number Count False Positives False Negatives Figure 14. False Positives and Negatives for the 6 nodes while there is none), and the number of false negatives (the IPA determines that there is no node while there is one). In about 45% of the cases, we obtained perfect results, i.e., no false positives and no false negatives. In the remaining cases, we obtained a number of false positives of at most one, and a number of false negatives of at most two. We exclude two pairs of pictures from Figure 14. In the first excluded pair, we obtain 42 false positives and in the second pair 10 false positives and 7 false negatives. By carefully examining the pictures, we realized that the first pair was taken out of focus and that a car temporarily appeared in one of the pictures of the second pair. The anomaly in the second set was due to the fact that we waited too long to take the second picture. If the pictures had been taken a few milliseconds apart, the car would have been represented on either both or none of the pictures and the IPA would have filtered it out. 5.2 Node ID Matching We evaluate the Node ID Matching component of our system by collecting empirical data (connectivity information) from the outdoor deployment of 26 nodes in the 120×60 ft2 area. We collect 20 sets of data for the high connectivity and low connectivity network deployments. Off-line we investigate the influence of coloring on the metrics of interest, by randomly assigning colors to the sensor nodes. For one experimental data set we generate 50 random assignments of colors to sensor nodes. It is important to observe that, for the evaluation of the Node ID Matching algorithm (color and connectivity constrained), we simulate the color assignment to sensor nodes. As mentioned in Section 4 the size of the coloring space available to us was 5 (5 colors). Through simulations of color assignment (not connectivity) we are able to investigate the influence that the size of the coloring space has on the accuracy of localization.

The number of existing and missing radio connections in the high connectivity experiment eter ε used in Algorithm 2 was 0.001. The results presented here represent averages over the randomly generated colorings and over all experimental data sets. We first investigate the accuracy of our proposed Radio Model, and subsequently use the derived values for the radio range in the evaluation of the Node ID matching component. 5.2.1 Radio Model From experiments, we obtain the average number of observed beacons (k, defined in Section 3.3.2) for the low connectivity network of 180 beacons and for the high connectivity network of 420 beacons. From our Radio Model (Equation 7, we obtain a radio range R = 25 ft for the low connectivity network and R = 40 ft for the high connectivity network. To estimate the accuracy of our simple model, we plot the number of radio links that exist in the networks, and the number of links that are missing, as functions of the distance between nodes. The results are shown in Figures 15 and 16. We define the average radio range R to be the distance over which less than 20% of potential radio links, are missing. As shown in Figure 15, the radio range is between 20 ft and 25 ft. For the higher connectivity network, the radio range was between 30 ft and 40 ft. We choose two conservative estimates of the radio range: 20 ft for the low connectivity case and 35 ft for the high connectivity case, which are in good agreement with the values predicted by our Radio Model. 5.2.2 Localization Error vs. Coloring Space Size In this experiment we investigate the effect of the number of colors on the localization accuracy. For this, we randomly assign colors from a pool of a given size, to the sensor nodes. 66 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 0 5 10 15 20 Number of Colors LocalizationError[feet] R=15feet R=20feet R=25feet Figure 17.

Percentage of nodes correctly localized We then execute the localization algorithm, which uses the empirical data. The algorithm is run for three different radio ranges: 15, 20 and 25 ft, to investigate its influence on the localization error. The results are depicted in Figure 17 (localization error) and Figure 18 (percentage of nodes correctly localized). As shown, for an estimate of 20 ft for the radio range (as predicted by our Radio Model) we obtain the smallest localization errors, as small as 2 ft, when enough colors are used. Both Figures 17 and 18 confirm our intuition that a larger number of colors available significantly decrease the error in localization. The well known fact that relaxation algorithms do not always converge, was observed during our experiments. The percentage of successful runs (when the algorithm converged) is depicted in Figure 19. As shown, in several situations, the algorithm failed to converge (the algorithm execution was stopped after 100 iterations per node). If the algorithm does not converge in a predetermined number of steps, it will terminate and the label with the highest probability will provide the identity of the node. It is very probable that the chosen label is incorrect, since the probabilities of some of labels are constantly changing (with each iteration).The convergence of relaxation based algorithms is a well known issue. 5.2.3 Localization Error vs. Color Uniqueness As mentioned in the Section 3.3.1, a unique color gives a sensor node the statute of an anchor. A sensor node that is an anchor can unequivocally be identified through the Image Processing module. In this section we investigate the effect unique colors have on the localization accuracy. Specifically, we want to experimentally verify our intuition that assigning more nodes to a color can benefit the localization accuracy, by enforcing more constraints, as opposed to uniquely assigning a color to a single node. 90 95 100 105 0 5 10 15 20 Number of Colors ConvergenceRate[x100] R=15feet R=20feet R=25feet Figure 19. Convergence error 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 4 6 8 Number of Colors LocalizationError[feet] 0 anchors 2 anchors 4 anchors 6 anchors 8 anchors Figure 20. Localization error vs. number of colors For this, we fix the number of available colors to either 4, 6 or 8 and vary the number of nodes that are given unique colors, from 0, up to the maximum number of colors (4, 6 or 8). Naturally, if we have a maximum number of colors of 4, we can assign at most 4 anchors. The experimental results are depicted in Figure 20 (localization error) and Figure 21 (percentage of sensor node correctly localized). As expected, the localization accuracy increases with the increase in the number of colors available (larger coloring space). Also, for a given size of the coloring space (e.g., 6 colors available), if more colors are uniquely assigned to sensor nodes then the localization accuracy decreases. It is interesting to observe that by assigning colors uniquely to nodes, the benefit of having additional colors is diminished. Specifically, if 8 colors are available and all are assigned uniquely, the system would be less accurately localized (error ≈ 7 ft), when compared to the case of 6 colors and no unique assignments of colors (≈ 5 ft localization error). The same trend, of a less accurate localization can be observed in Figure 21, which shows the percentage of nodes correctly localized (i.e., 0 ft localization error). As shown, if we increase the number of colors that are uniquely assigned, the percentage of nodes correctly localized decreases. 5.2.4 Localization Error vs. Connectivity We collected empirical data for two network deployments with different degrees of connectivity (high and low) in order to assess the influence of connectivity on location accuracy. The results obtained from running our localization algorithm are depicted in Figure 22 and Figure 23. We varied the number of colors available and assigned no anchors (i.e., no unique assignments of colors). In both scenarios, as expected, localization error decrease with an increase in the number of colors. It is interesting to observe, however, that the low connectivity scenario im67 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 4 6 8 Number of Colors %CorrectLocalized[x100] 0 anchors 2 anchors 4 anchors 6 anchors 8 anchors Figure 21.

Localization error vs. number of colors proves the localization accuracy quicker, from the additional number of colors available. When the number of colors becomes relatively large (twelve for our 26 sensor node network), both scenarios (low and high connectivity) have comparable localization errors, of less that 2 ft. The same trend of more accurate location information is evidenced by Figure 23 which shows that the percentage of nodes that are localized correctly grows quicker for the low connectivity deployment. 5.3 Localization Error vs. Image Processing Errors So far we investigated the sources for error in localization that are intrinsic to the Node ID Matching component. As previously presented, luminous objects can be mistakenly detected to be sensor nodes during the location detection phase of the Image Processing module. These false positives can be eliminated by the color recognition procedure of the Image Processing module. More problematic are false negatives (when a sensor node does not reflect back enough light to be detected). They need to be handled by the localization algorithm. In this case, the localization algorithm is presented with two sets of nodes of different sizes, that need to be matched: one coming from the Image Processing (which misses some nodes) and one coming from the network, with the connectivity information (here we assume a fully connected network, so that all sensor nodes report their connectivity information). In this experiment we investigate how Image Processing errors (false negatives) influence the localization accuracy. For this evaluation, we ran our localization algorithm with empirical data, but dropped a percentage of nodes from the list of nodes detected by the Image Processing algorithm (we artificially introduced false negatives in the Image Process0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Number of Colors %CorrectLocalized[x100] Low Connectivity High Connectivity Figure 23.

Impact of false negatives on the localization error ing). The effect of false negatives on localization accuracy is depicted in Figure 24. As seen in the figure if the number of false negatives is 15%, the error in position estimation doubles when 4 colors are available. It is interesting to observe that the scenario when more colors are available (e.g., 12 colors) is being affected more drastically than the scenario with less colors (e.g., 4 colors). The benefit of having more colors available is still being maintained, at least for the range of colors we investigated (4 through 12 colors). 5.4 Localization Time In this section we look more closely at the duration for each of the four proposed relaxation techniques and two combinations of them: color-connectivity and color-time. We assume that 50 unique color filters can be manufactured, that the sensor network is deployed from 2,400 ft (necessary for the time-constrained relaxation) and that the time required for reporting connectivity grows linearly, with an initial reporting period of 160sec, as used in a real world tracking application [1]. The localization duration results, as presented in Table 1, are depicted in Figure 25. As shown, for all practical purposes the time required by the space constrained relaxation techniques is 0sec. The same applies to the color constrained relaxation, for which the localization time is 0sec (if the number of colors is sufficient). Considering our assumptions, only for a network of size 50 the color constrained relaxation works. The localization duration for all other network sizes (100, 150 and 200) is infinite (i.e., unique color assignments to sensor nodes can not be made, since only 50 colors are unique), when only color constrained relaxation is used. Both the connectivity constrained and time constrained techniques increase linearly with the network size (for the time constrained, the Central device deploys sensor nodes one by one, recording an image after the time a sensor node is expected to reach the 68 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 Color Connectivity Time Space ColorConenctivity Color-Time Localization technique Localizationtime[sec] 50 nodes 100 nodes 150 nodes 200 nodes Figure 25.

It is interesting to notice in Figure 25 the improvement in the localization time obtained by simply combining the color and the connectivity constrained techniques. The localization duration in this case is identical with the connectivity constrained technique. The combination of color and time constrained relaxations is even more interesting. For a reasonable localization duration of 52seconds a perfect (i.e., 0 ft localization error) localization system can be built. In this scenario, the set of sensor nodes is split in batches, with each batch having a set of unique colors. It would be very interesting to consider other scenarios, where the strength of the space constrained relaxation (0sec for any sensor network size) is used for improving the other proposed relaxation techniques. We leave the investigation and rigorous classification of such technique combination for future work. 5.5 System Range In this section we evaluate the feasibility of the StarDust localization framework when considering the realities of light propagation through the atmosphere. The main factor that determines the range of our system is light scattering, which redirects the luminance of the source into the medium (in essence equally affecting the luminosity of the target and of the background). Scattering limits the visibility range by reducing the apparent contrast between the target and its background (approaches zero, as the distance increases). The apparent contrast Cr is quantitatively expressed by the formula: Cr = (Nt r −Nb r )/Nb r (10) where Nt r and Nb r are the apparent target radiance and apparent background radiance at distance r from the light source, respectively. The apparent radiance Nt r of a target at a distance r from the light source, is given by: Nt r = Na + Iρte−2σr πr2 (11) where I is the intensity of the light source, ρt is the target reflectance, σ is the spectral attenuation coefficient (≈ 0.12km−1 and ≈ 0.60km−1 for a clear and a hazy atmosphere, respectively) and Na is the radiance of the atmospheric backscatter, and it can be expressed as follows: Na = Gσ2I 2π 2σrZ 0.02σr e−x x2 dx (12) where G = 0.24 is a backscatter gain. The apparent background radiance Nb r is given by formulas similar with Equations 11 and 12, where only the target reflectance ρt is substituted with the background reflectance ρb. It is important to remark that when Cr reaches its lower limit, no increase in the source luminance or receiver sensitivity will increase the range of the system. From Equations 11 and 12 it can be observed that the parameter which can be controlled and can influence the range of the system is ρt, the target reflectance. Figures 26 and 27 depict the apparent contrast Cr as a function of the distance r for a clear and for a hazy atmosphere, respectively. The apparent contrast is investigated for reflectance coefficients ρt ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 (perfect reflector). For a contrast C of at least 0.5, as it can be seen in Figure 26 a range of approximately 4,500 ft can be achieved if the atmosphere is clear. The performance dramatically deteriorates, when the atmospheric conditions are problematic. As shown in Figure 27 a range of up to 1,500 ft is achievable, when using highly reflective CCR components. While our light source (3 million candlepower) was sufficient for a range of a few hundred feet, we remark that there exist commercially available light sources (20 million candlepower) or military (150 million candlepower [27]), powerful enough for ranges of a few thousand feet. 6 StarDust System Optimizations In this section we describe extensions of the proposed architecture that can constitute future research directions. 6.1 Chained Constraint Primitives In this paper we proposed four primitives for constraintbased relaxation algorithms: color, connectivity, time and space. To demonstrate the power that can be obtained by combining them, we proposed and evaluated one combination of such primitives: color and connectivity. An interesting research direction to pursue could be to chain more than two of these primitives. An example of such chain is: color, temporal, spatial and connectivity. Other research directions could be to use voting scheme for deciding which primitive to use or assign different weights to different relaxation algorithms. 69 6.2 Location Learning If after several iterations of the algorithm, none of the label probabilities for a node ni converges to a higher value, the confidence in our labeling of that node is relatively low. It would be interesting to associate with a node, more than one label (implicitly more than one location) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network (if the network was deployed for target tracking). 6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in extremely rugged environments. Canopies, dense vegetation, extremely obstructing environments pose significant challenges for sensor nodes localization. The hope, and our original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears under the canopy. By recording the last visible position of a sensor node (as seen from the aircraft) a reasonable estimate of the sensor node location can be obtained. This would require that sensor nodes posses self-righting capabilities, while in mid-air. Nevertheless, we remark on the suitability of our localization framework for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 7 Conclusions StarDust solves the localization problem for aerial deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required. Results show that accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within milliseconds. StarDust also shows robustness with respect to errors. We predict the influence the atmospheric conditions can have on the range of a system based on the StarDust framework, and show that hazy environments or daylight can pose significant challenges. Most importantly, the properties of StarDust support the potential for even more accurate localization solutions as well as solutions for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 8 References [1] T.

Departamento de Ciencias de la Computación de Stankovic, Universidad de Virginia † Departamento de Informática e Ingeniería, Universidad de Minnesota {Stoleru, PV9F}@cs.virginia.edu, tianhe@cs.umn.edu, stankovic@cs.virginia.edu Resumen El problema de la localización en redes de sensores inalámbricos donde los nodos no usan hardware de rango, sigue siendo un problema desafiante, al considerar la ubicación requeridaPrecisión, gasto de energía y la duración de la fase de localización. En este artículo proponemos un marco, llamado Stardust, para la localización de la red de sensores inalámbricos basada en componentes ópticos pasivos. En el marco Stardust, los nodos sensores están equipados con reflectores retro ópticos. Un dispositivo aéreo proyecta luz hacia la red de sensores implementada y registra una imagen de la luz reflejada. Se desarrolla un algoritmo de procesamiento de imágenes para obtener las ubicaciones de los nodos sensores. Para hacer coincidir una ID de nodo con una ubicación, proponemos un algoritmo de relajación de etiquetas basado en restricciones. Proponemos y desarrollamos técnicas de localización basadas en cuatro tipos de restricciones: color de nodo, información de vecinos, tiempo de implementación para un nodo y ubicación de implementación para un nodo. Evaluamos el rendimiento de un sistema de localización basado en nuestro marco localizando una red de 26 nodos sensores implementados en un área de 120 × 60 pies2. La precisión de localización varía de 2 pies a 5 pies, mientras que el tiempo de localización varía de 10 milisegundos a 2 minutos. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos: C.2.4 [Redes de comunicaciones informáticas]: sistemas distribuidos;C.3 [Sistemas de propósito y aplicaciones especiales]: Sistemas en tiempo real e integrados Términos generales: los algoritmos, la medición, el rendimiento, el diseño, la experimentación 1 Introducción Las redes de sensores inalámbricos (WSN) se han imaginado para revolucionar la forma en que los humanos perciben e interactúan conel entorno circundante. Una visión es incrustar pequeños dispositivos de sensores en entornos al aire libre, por despliegues aéreos de vehículos aéreos no tripulados. Los nodos del sensor forman una red y colaboran (para compensar los recursos extremadamente escasos disponibles para cada uno de ellos: potencia computacional, tamaño de la memoria, capacidades de comunicación) para lograr la misión. A través de la colaboración, la redundancia y la tolerancia a las fallas, el WSN puede lograr capacidades de detección sin precedentes. Se ha logrado un gran paso adelante mediante el desarrollo de sistemas para varios dominios: vigilancia militar [1] [2] [3], monitoreo del hábitat [4] y monitoreo estructural [5]. Incluso después de estos éxitos, varios problemas de investigación permanecen abiertos. Entre estos problemas abiertos se encuentra la localización del nodo del sensor, es decir, cómo encontrar la posición física de cada nodo del sensor. A pesar de la atención que ha recibido el problema de localización en WSN, no se ha desarrollado ninguna solución universalmente aceptable. Hay varias razones para esto. Por un lado, los esquemas de localización que usan rango son típicamente soluciones de alta gama. El hardware que ranga el GPS consume energía, es relativamente costoso (si se requiere una alta precisión) y plantea desafíos de factores que nos alejan de la visión de los nodos del sensor de tamaño de polvo. El ultrasonido tiene un alcance corto y es altamente direccional. Las soluciones que usan el transceptor de radio para el rango no han producido resultados alentadores (si se usa el indicador de resistencia a la señal recibido) o son sensibles al entorno (por ejemplo, múltiples trayectoria). Por otro lado, los esquemas de localización que solo usan la información de conectividad para inferir la información de ubicación se caracterizan por bajas precisiones: ≈ 10 pies en entornos controlados, 40-50 pies en realistas. Para abordar estos desafíos, proponemos un marco para la localización de WSN, llamado Stardust, en el que la complejidad asociada con la localización del nodo se elimina por completo del nodo del sensor. El principio básico del marco es la localización a través de la pasividad: cada nodo del sensor está equipado con un retro-reflector de cubo de esquina y posiblemente un filtro óptico (un dispositivo de coloración). Un vehículo aéreo proyecta luz sobre el área de despliegue y registra imágenes que contienen vigas de luz retro-reflectadas (aparecen como puntos luminosos). A través de técnicas de procesamiento de imágenes, las ubicaciones de los reflectores retro (es decir, nodos de sensor) se detienen 57. Para inferir la identidad del nodo del sensor presente en una ubicación particular, el marco Stardust desarrolla un algoritmo de relajación de ID de nodo basado en restricciones. Las principales contribuciones de nuestro trabajo son las siguientes. Proponemos un marco novedoso para la localización de nodos en WSN que es muy prometedor y permite muchas extensiones futuras y resultados más precisos. Proponemos un algoritmo de relajación de etiquetas basado en restricciones para mapear las ID de nodo a las ubicaciones y cuatro restricciones (nodo, conectividad, tiempo y espacio), que son bloques de construcción para sistemas de localización muy precisos y muy rápidos. Desarrollamos un prototipo de hardware de nodo sensor, llamado sensorball. Evaluamos el rendimiento de un sistema de localización para el cual obtenemos precisiones de ubicación de 2 - 5 pies con una duración de localización que varía de 10 milisegundos a 2 minutos. Investigamos el rango de un sistema basado en nuestro marco al considerar las realidades de los fenómenos físicos que ocurre durante la propagación de la luz a través de la atmósfera. El resto del documento está estructurado de la siguiente manera. La Sección 2 es una descripción general del estado del arte. El diseño del marco Stardust se presenta en la Sección 3. Una implementación y su evaluación de rendimiento se encuentran en las Secciones 4 y 5, seguidas de un conjunto de técnicas de optimización del sistema, en la Sección 6. En la Sección 7 presentamos nuestras conclusiones.2 Trabajo relacionado Presentamos el trabajo anterior en la localización en dos categorías principales: los esquemas basados en rango y sin rango. Las técnicas de localización basadas en la gama se han diseñado para usar hardware más caro (y, por lo tanto, una mayor precisión) o solo el transceptor de radio. Las técnicas de rango que dependen del hardware son el tiempo de vuelo (TOF) y la diferencia de llegada (TDOA). Las soluciones que usan la radio se basan en el indicador de resistencia a la señal recibido (RSSI) y más recientemente en la interferometría de la radio. La técnica de localización TOF que se usa más ampliamente es el GPS. GPS es una solución costosa para una localización de alta precisión de una red de sensores a gran escala. Ahlos [6] emplea una técnica de rango TDOA que requiere un hardware extenso y resuelve sistemas de ecuaciones no lineales relativamente grandes. El sistema de soporte de ubicación del cricket (TDOA) [7] puede lograr una granularidad de ubicación de decenas de pulgadas con transceptores de ultrasonido de alto rango altamente direccionales y de corto alcance. En [2], la ubicación de un francotirador se determina en un terreno urbano, utilizando el TDOA entre una onda acústica y una radio de radio. El proyecto Pushpin [8] utiliza el TDOA entre pulsos de ultrasonido y flashes de luz para la localización de nodos. El sistema de radar [9] utiliza el RSSI para construir un mapa de resistencias a la señal emitida por un conjunto de nodos de baliza. Un nodo móvil está ubicado por la mejor coincidencia, en el espacio de intensidad de la señal, con una firma previamente adquirida. En MAL [10], un nodo móvil ayuda a medir las distancias (actuando como restricciones) entre nodos hasta que se genera un gráfico rígido. El problema de localización se formula como una estimación de estado en línea en un sistema dinámico no lineal [11]. En [12] se propone un alcance cooperativo que intenta lograr un posicionamiento global de las optimizaciones locales distribuidas. Una técnica de localización muy reciente y notable se basa en la interferometría de radio, RIPS [13], que utiliza dos transmisores para crear una señal interferente. Las frecuencias de los emisores están muy cerca entre sí, por lo que la señal interferente tendrá una envoltura de baja frecuencia que se puede medir fácilmente. La técnica de rango funciona muy bien. El largo tiempo requerido para la localización y los entornos de múltiples rutas plantean desafíos significativos. Los entornos reales crean desafíos adicionales para los esquemas de localización basados en el rango. Estos han sido enfatizados por varios estudios [14] [15] [16]. Para abordar estos desafíos y otros (costo de hardware, el gasto de energía, el factor de forma, el rango pequeño, el tiempo de localización), se han propuesto varios esquemas de localización sin rango. Los nodos sensores utilizan la información principalmente de conectividad para inferir la proximidad a un conjunto de anclajes. En el esquema de localización del centroide [17], un nodo sensor se localiza en el centroide de sus nodos de baliza próximos. En APIT [18], cada nodo decide su posición en función de la posibilidad de estar dentro o fuera de un triángulo formado por tres balizas dentro del rango de comunicación de nodos. El algoritmo de gradiente [19] aprovecha el conocimiento sobre la densidad de la red para inferir la longitud promedio de un salto. Esto, a su vez, se puede transformar en distancias a nodos con ubicaciones conocidas. DV-HOP [20] utiliza la capacidad de propagación de HOP by Hop de la red para reenviar distancias a los puntos de referencia. Más recientemente, se han propuesto varios esquemas de localización que explotan las capacidades de detección de los nodos sensores. Spotlight [21] crea eventos bien controlados (en el tiempo y el espacio) en la red, mientras que los nodos del sensor detectan y el tiempo de tiempo acumulan estos eventos. A partir del conocimiento espacio -temporal para los eventos creados y la información temporal proporcionada por los nodos sensores, se pueden obtener información espacial de los nodos. De manera similar, el sistema del faro [22] utiliza un haz de luz paralelo, que es emitido por un ancla que gira con un cierto período. Un nodo del sensor detecta el haz de luz durante un período de tiempo, que depende de la distancia entre él y el dispositivo emisor de luz. Muchas de las soluciones de localización anteriores se dirigen a conjuntos específicos de requisitos y son útiles para aplicaciones específicas. Stardust difiere en que aborda un conjunto de requisitos en particular exigente que aún no se resuelven bien. Stardust está destinado a localizar los nodos caídos de aire donde se requiere pasividad de nodos, alta precisión, bajo costo, factor de forma pequeña y localización rápida. Muchas aplicaciones militares tienen tales requisitos.3 Diseño del sistema Stardust El diseño del sistema Stardust (y su nombre) se inspiró en la similitud entre una red de sensores desplegadas, en la que los nodos sensores indican su presencia emitiendo luz y el universo que consiste en objetos luminosos e iluminados: estrellas, galaxias, planetas, etc. La principal dificultad al aplicar las ideas anteriores al mundo real es la complejidad del hardware que debe colocarse en un nodo sensor para que la luz emitida pueda detectarse de miles de pies. El gasto de energía para producir un haz de luz lo suficientemente intenso también es prohibitivo. En cambio, lo que proponemos usar para la localización del nodo del sensor es un elemento óptico pasivo llamado retro-reflector. El componente óptico retro-reflectante más común es un retrorreflector de cubo de esquina (CCR), que se muestra en la Figura 1 (a). Consiste en tres espejos perpendiculares mutuamente. El inter58 (a) (b) Figura 1. El retrorreflector de cubo de esquina (a) y una matriz de CCR moldeados en la propiedad de plástico (b) esting de este componente óptico es que un haz de luz entrante se refleja hacia atrás, hacia la fuente de la luz, independientemente del ángulo de incidencia. Esto está en contraste con un espejo, que debe posicionarse con precisión para ser perpendicular a la luz del incidente. Una implementación muy común y económica de una matriz de CCR es el material de plástico retrorrefrefreflectante utilizado en automóviles y bicicletas para la detección nocturna, que se muestra en la Figura 1 (b). En el sistema Stardust, cada nodo está equipado con una pequeña variedad (por ejemplo, 0.5in2) de CCR y el recinto tiene capacidades de autosuficiencia que orientan la matriz de CCR predominantemente hacia arriba. Es fundamental comprender que la orientación ascendente no necesita ser exacta. Incluso cuando hay grandes variaciones angulares de una orientación perfectamente ascendente, un CCR devolverá la luz en la misma dirección desde la que vino. En la parte restante de la sección, presentamos la arquitectura del sistema Stardust y el diseño de sus componentes principales.3.1 Arquitectura del sistema El escenario de localización de la red de sensores previsto es el siguiente: • Los nodos del sensor se liberan, posiblemente de manera controlada, desde un vehículo aéreo durante la noche.• El vehículo aéreo se cierne sobre el área de despliegue y utiliza una luz estroboscópica para iluminarlo. Los nodos del sensor, equipados con CCR y filtros ópticos (que actúan como dispositivos para colorear) tienen capacidades de autosuficiencia y retrorrefligen la luz estroboscópica entrante. La luz retro-reflectada es blanca, como la luz fuente de origen, o coloreada, debido a filtros ópticos.• El vehículo aéreo registra una secuencia de dos imágenes muy cercanas en el tiempo (nivel de msc). Se toma una imagen cuando la luz estroboscópica está encendida, la otra cuando la luz estroboscópica está apagada. Las imágenes adquiridas se utilizan para obtener las ubicaciones de los nodos sensores (que aparecen como puntos luminosos en la imagen).• El vehículo aéreo ejecuta el mapeo de ID de nodo a las ubicaciones identificadas de una de las siguientes maneras: a) utilizando el color de una luz retro-reflectada, si un nodo sensor tiene un color único;b) al requerir nodos sensores para establecer información del vecindario e informarla a una estación base;c) controlando la secuencia de tiempo del despliegue de nodos del sensor y grabando el nodo del sensor del emisor imlight adicional I Función de transferencia φi (λ) ψ (λ) φ (ψ (λ)) Procesamiento de imágenes ID del nodo de radio Modelo R G (λ, E) CentralDispositivo V V Figura 2. La arquitectura del sistema Stardust Starys;d) controlando la ubicación donde se implementa un nodo del sensor.• Las ubicaciones calculadas se difunden a la red de sensores. La arquitectura del sistema Stardust se muestra en la Figura 2. La arquitectura consta de dos componentes principales: el primero está centralizado y se encuentra en un dispositivo más potente. El segundo se distribuye y reside en todos los nodos del sensor. El dispositivo central consta de lo siguiente: el emisor de luz, el módulo de procesamiento de imágenes, el módulo de mapeo de ID del nodo y el modelo de radio. El componente distribuido de la arquitectura es la función de transferencia, que actúa como un filtro para la luz entrante. Los módulos antes mencionados se describen brevemente a continuación: • Emisor de luz: es una luz estroboscópica, capaz de producir pulsos de luz colimados muy intensos. La luz emitida no es monocromática (a diferencia de un láser) y se caracteriza por una densidad espectral ψ (λ), una función de la longitud de onda. La luz emitida es incidente en los CCR presentes en los nodos del sensor.• Función de transferencia φ (ψ (λ)): este es un filtro de paso de banda para la luz incidente en el CCR. El filtro permite que una porción del espectro original se retroifique. De aquí en adelante, nos referiremos a la función de transferencia como el color de un nodo sensor.• Procesamiento de imágenes: el módulo de procesamiento de imágenes adquiere imágenes de alta resolución. A partir de estas imágenes se obtienen las ubicaciones y los colores de los nodos sensores. Si solo se puede tomar un conjunto de imágenes (es decir, una ubicación del dispositivo de análisis de emisor de luz/imagen), se supone que el mapa del campo se conoce, así como la distancia entre el dispositivo de imagen y el campo. Los supuestos antes mencionados (mapa de campo y distancia a él) no son necesarias si las imágenes pueden tomarse simultáneamente de diferentes ubicaciones. Es importante observar aquí que la identidad de un nodo no se puede obtener directamente a través del procesamiento de imágenes solo, a menos que se pueda identificar una característica específica de un nodo sensor en la imagen.• Matriculación de ID de nodo: este módulo utiliza las ubicaciones detectadas y a través de técnicas adicionales (por ejemplo, coloración del nodo del sensor y información de conectividad (g (λ, e)) de la red implementada) para identificar de manera única los nodos sensores observados en la imagen. La información de conectividad está representada por las tablas vecinas enviadas desde 59 Algoritmo 1 Procesamiento de imágenes 1: Filtrado de fondo 2: Reconocimiento de luz retro-reflectado a través del filtrado de intensidad 3: Detección de borde para obtener la ubicación de los nodos sensores 4: Identificación de color para cada nodo sensor detectado cada unonodo sensor al dispositivo central.• Modelo de radio: este componente proporciona una estimación de la gama de radio al módulo de coincidencia de ID del nodo. Solo se usa mediante técnicas de coincidencia de ID de nodo que se basan en la conectividad de radio en la red. La estimación del rango de radio R se basa en la densidad del nodo del sensor (obtenida a través del módulo de procesamiento de imágenes) y la información de conectividad (es decir, G (λ, E)). Los dos componentes principales de la arquitectura Stardust son el procesamiento de imágenes y la asignación de ID de nodo. Su diseño y análisis se presenta en las secciones que siguen.3.2 Procesamiento de imágenes El objetivo del algoritmo de procesamiento de imágenes (IPA) es identificar la ubicación de los nodos y su color. Tenga en cuenta que IPA no identifica qué nodo cayó, sino solo cuál es el conjunto de ubicaciones donde cayeron los nodos. IPA se ejecuta después de que un vehículo aéreo registra dos imágenes: una en la que se ilumina el campo de implementación y otra cuando no hay iluminaciones presentes. Deje que PDark sea la imagen del área de despliegue, tomada cuando no se emitió luz y la difícil situación sea la imagen del mismo área de despliegue cuando se dirigió un fuerte haz de luz hacia los nodos del sensor. El IPA propuesto tiene varios pasos, como se muestra en el algoritmo 1. El primer paso es obtener una tercera imagen PFILTER donde solo quedan las diferencias entre PDARK y la situación. Supongamos que PDARK tiene una resolución de N × M, donde N es el número de píxeles en una fila de la imagen, mientras que M es el número de píxeles en una columna de la imagen. Entonces PDARK está compuesto de píxeles n × m notados PDark (i, j), i ∈ 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m.Del mismo modo, la situación se compone de la difícil situación de los píxeles N × M (I, J), 1 ≤ I ≤ N, 1 ≤ J ≤ m.Cada píxel P se describe mediante un valor RGB donde el valor R se denota por PR, PG denota el valor G y el valor B se denota por Pb. IPA luego genera la tercera imagen, PFilter, a través de las siguientes transformaciones: Filtro PR (i, J) = PR Light (I, J) -P Dark (I, J) PG Filtro (I, J) = PG Light (I,j) -pg oscuro (i, j) filtro Pb (i, j) = pb luz (i, j) −pb oscuro (i, j) (1) Después de esta transformación, todas las características que aparecieron tanto en PDARK como en la situaciónse eliminan de pFilter. Esto simplifica el reconocimiento de la luz retro-reflectada por nodos sensores. El segundo paso consiste en identificar los elementos contenidos en PFILTER que retrocede la luz. Para esto, se aplica un filtro de intensidad a PFilter. Primero IPA convierte PFilter en una imagen en escala de grises. Luego, los píxeles más brillantes se identifican y se usan para crear preflect. Este paso se facilita por el hecho de que los nodos reflectantes deben parecer mucho más brillantes que cualquier otro objeto iluminado en la imagen. Soporte: Q (λk) Ni P1 ... P2 ... Pn λ1 ... λk ... λn Figura 3. Relajación de la etiqueta probabilística El tercer paso ejecuta un algoritmo de detección de bordes en el preflect para identificar el límite de los nodos presentes. Una herramienta como MATLAB proporciona una serie de técnicas de detección de bordes. Utilizamos la función BWBoundaria. Para los bordes obtenidos, la ubicación (x, y) (en la imagen) de cada nodo se determina calculando el centroide de los puntos que constituyen sus bordes. Las técnicas estándar de gráficos por computadora [23] se utilizan para transformar las ubicaciones 2D de los nodos sensores detectados en múltiples imágenes en ubicaciones de nodos del sensor 3D. El color del nodo se obtiene como el color del píxel ubicado en (x, y) en la situación.3.3 ID de nodo coincidir El objetivo del módulo de coincidencia de ID del nodo es obtener la identidad (ID del nodo) de un punto luminoso en la imagen, detectado como un nodo del sensor. Para esto, definimos v = {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xm, ym)} para ser el conjunto de ubicaciones de los nodos sensores, detectados por el módulo de procesamiento de imágenes y λ= {λ1, λ2, ..., λm} para ser el conjunto de ID de nodo únicos asignados a los nodos del sensor M, antes de la implementación. De aquí en adelante, nos referimos a los ID de nodo como etiquetas. Modelamos el problema de encontrar la etiqueta λj de un nodo Ni como un problema de relajación de etiqueta probabilística, utilizada con frecuencia en el procesamiento/comprensión de imágenes. En el dominio de procesamiento de imágenes, el etiquetado de la escena (es decir, la identificación de objetos en una imagen) juega un papel importante. El objetivo del etiquetado de la escena es asignar una etiqueta a cada objeto detectado en una imagen, de modo que se logra una interpretación de imagen apropiada. Es prohibitivamente costoso considerar las interacciones entre todos los objetos en una imagen. En cambio, las restricciones colocadas entre los objetos cercanos generan consistencias locales y, a través de la iteración, se pueden obtener consistencias globales. La idea principal de la localización del nodo del sensor a través de la relajación de la etiqueta probabilística es calcular iterativamente la probabilidad de que cada etiqueta sea la etiqueta correcta para un nodo del sensor, teniendo en cuenta, en cada iteración, el soporte para una etiqueta. El soporte para una etiqueta puede entenderse como una pista o prueba, que es más probable que una etiqueta en particular sea la correcta, en comparación con las otras etiquetas potenciales para un nodo del sensor. Representamos picorialmente esta idea principal en la Figura 3. Como se muestra, el nodo Ni tiene un conjunto de etiquetas candidatas {λ1, ..., λk}. Cada una de las etiquetas tiene un valor diferente para la función de soporte Q (λk). Diferimos la explicación de cómo se implementa la función de soporte hasta las subsecciones que siguen, donde proporcionamos cuatro técnicas concretas. Formalmente, el algoritmo se describe en el algoritmo 2, donde las ecuaciones necesarias para calcular el nuevo PNI de probabilidad (λk) para una etiqueta λk de un nodo Ni, se expresan mediante la relajación de la etiqueta de 60 algoritmo 2: para cada nodo sensor Ni do 2 DO 2 DO 2 DO 2: asignar igual prob.A todas las etiquetas posibles 3: Fin para 4: Repita 5: Convergente ← Verdadero 6: para cada nodo sensor Ni Do 7: para cada una etiqueta λj de ni do 8: Calcule la etiqueta de soporte λj: Ecuación 4 9: Fin para 10:Calcule k para el nodo Ni: Ecuación 3 11: para cada una etiqueta λj do 12: Probabilidad de actualización de la etiqueta λj: Ecuación 2 13: If | NUEVO Prob. - Prob.≥ ε luego 14: convergente ← Falso 15: Fin si 16: Fin para 17: Fin para 18: Hasta que convergente = Reales ecuaciones siguientes: PS+1 Ni (λk) = 1 Kni PS Ni (λk) Qs Ni (λk) (2) donde KNI es una constante de normalización, dada por: kni = n ∑ k = 1 ps ni (λk) qs ni (λk) (3) y qs ni (λk) es: qs ni (λk) = soporte para la etiqueta λkde nodo Ni (4) El algoritmo de relajación de la etiqueta es iterativo y es polinomio en el tamaño de la red (número de nodos). El pseudo-código se muestra en el algoritmo 2. Inicializa las probabilidades asociadas con cada etiqueta posible, para un nodo Ni, a través de una distribución uniforme. En cada iteración s, el algoritmo actualiza la probabilidad asociada con cada etiqueta, considerando el soporte QS Ni (λk) para cada etiqueta candidata de un nodo sensor. En las secciones que siguen, describimos cuatro técnicas diferentes para implementar la función de soporte: basado en la coloración de nodos, la conectividad de radio, el tiempo de implementación (tiempo) y la ubicación de la implementación (espacio). Si bien algunas de estas técnicas son simplistas, son primitivas que, cuando se combinan, pueden crear potentes sistemas de localización. Estas técnicas de diseño tienen diferentes compensaciones, que presentaremos en la Sección 3.3.6.3.3.1 Relajación con restricciones de color El mapeo único entre una posición de nodos del sensor (identificada por el procesamiento de la imagen) y se puede obtener una etiqueta asignando un color único a cada nodo del sensor. Para esto definimos C = {C1, C2, ..., CN} para ser el conjunto de colores únicos disponibles y M: λ → C para ser un mapeo uno a uno de las etiquetas a los colores. Esta asignación se conoce antes de la implementación del nodo del sensor (desde la fabricación de nodos). En el caso de la relajación de la etiqueta restringida del color, el soporte para la etiqueta λk se expresa de la siguiente manera: Qs Ni (λk) = 1 (5) Como resultado, el algoritmo de relajación de la etiqueta (algoritmo 2) consiste en los siguientes pasos: una etiqueta es IS esasignado a cada nodo del sensor (líneas 1-3 del algoritmo), con una probabilidad implícita PNI (λk) = 1;El algoritmo ejecuta una sola iteración, cuando la función de soporte, simplemente, reitera la confianza en el etiquetado único. Sin embargo, a menudo es el caso de que los colores únicos para cada nodo no estarán disponibles. Es interesante discutir aquí la influencia que tiene el tamaño del espacio para colorear (es decir, | c |) sobre la precisión del algoritmo de localización. Varios casos se discuten a continuación: • Si | C |= 0, no se usan colores y los nodos del sensor están equipados con CCR simples que reflejan toda la luz entrante (es decir, sin filtrado y sin coloración de la luz entrante). Desde el sistema de procesamiento de imágenes, la posición de los nodos sensores aún se puede obtener. Dado que todos los nodos aparecen blancos, no se puede identificar de manera única el nodo del sensor.• Si | C |= M - 1 Entonces hay suficientes colores únicos para todos los nodos (un nodo permanece blanco, es decir, sin coloración), el problema se resuelve trivialmente. Cada nodo se puede identificar, en función de su color único. Este es el escenario para la relajación con limitaciones de color.• Si | C |≥ 1, hay varias opciones sobre cómo dividir el espacio para colorear. Si C = {C1} una posibilidad es asignar el color C1 a un solo nodo, y dejar los nodos del sensor M - 1 restantes blancos, o asignar el color C1 a más de un nodo del sensor. Se puede observar que una vez que un color se asigna de manera única a un nodo del sensor, en efecto, ese nodo del sensor tiene el estado de ancla o nodo con ubicación conocida. Es interesante observar que hay un espectro completo de posibilidades sobre cómo dividir el conjunto de nodos sensores en las clases de equivalencia (donde una clase de equivalencia está representada por un color), para maximizar el éxito del algoritmo de localización. Uno de los objetivos de este documento es comprender cómo el tamaño del espacio para colorear y su partición afectan la precisión de la localización. A pesar de la simplicidad de este método para restringir el conjunto de etiquetas que se pueden asignar a un nodo, mostraremos que esta técnica es muy poderosa, cuando se combina con otras técnicas de relajación.3.3.2 Relajación con restricciones de conectividad La información de conectividad, obtenida de la red de sensores a través de Beaconing, puede proporcionar información adicional para localizar nodos de sensores. Para recopilar información de conectividad, lo siguiente debe ocurrir: 1) después de la implementación, a través del balance de mensajes de saludo, los nodos de sensores construyen sus tablas de vecindario;2) Cada nodo envía su información de la tabla vecina al dispositivo central a través de una estación base. Primero, definamos que G = (λ, E) sea el gráfico de conectividad ponderado construido por el dispositivo central a partir de la información de la tabla vecina recibida. En g, el borde (λi, λj) tiene un 61 λ1 λ2 ... λn ni nj gi2, j2 λ1 λ2 ... λn pj, λ1 pj, λ2 ... pj, λn pi, λ1 pi, λ1 ...Pi, λn Gi2, JM Figura 4. Relajación de etiqueta con restricciones de conectividad GiJ representado por el número de balizas enviadas por λj y recibidas por λi. Además, sea R rango de radio de los nodos del sensor. La idea principal de la relajación de la etiqueta limitada de conectividad se representa en la Figura 4 en la que se han asignado dos nodos Ni y NJ a todas las etiquetas posibles. La confianza en cada una de las etiquetas candidatas para un nodo del sensor, está representada por una probabilidad, que se muestra en un rectángulo punteado. Es importante observar que a través de la baliza y el informe de las tablas de vecinos al dispositivo central, se puede obtener una visión global de todas las limitaciones en la red. Es fundamental observar que estas limitaciones se encuentran entre las etiquetas. Como se muestra en la Figura 4, existen dos restricciones entre los nodos Ni y NJ. Las restricciones son representadas por Gi2, J2 y Gi2, JM, el número de balizas envió las etiquetas λj2 y λjm y recibidas por la etiqueta λi2. El soporte para la etiqueta λk del nodo del sensor Ni, resultante de la interacción (es decir, dentro del rango de radio) con el nodo del sensor NJ viene dado por: Qs Ni (λk) = M ∑ M = 1 Gλkλm PS NJ (λm) (6)Como resultado, el algoritmo de localización (el algoritmo 3 consta de los siguientes pasos: todas las etiquetas se asignan a cada nodo del sensor (líneas 1-3 del algoritmo), e implícitamente cada etiqueta tiene una probabilidad inicializada a PNI (λk) = 1///////////// 1/1/1| Λ |; en cada iteración, las probabilidades de las etiquetas de un nodo sensor se actualizan, cuando se considera la interacción con las etiquetas de los nodos sensores dentro de R. Es importante observar que la identidad de los nodos dentro de R no se conoce,Solo las etiquetas candidatas y sus probabilidades. El algoritmo de relajación converge cuando, durante una iteración, la probabilidad de no etiqueta es actualizada por más de ε. El algoritmo de relajación de la etiqueta basado en restricciones de conectividad, hace cumplir tales restricciones entre pares de nodos de sensores. Para una implementación de la red de sensores a gran escala, no es factible considerar todos los pares de nodos de sensores en la red. Por lo tanto, el algoritmo solo debe considerar pares de nodos sensores que están dentro de un rango de comunicación razonable (R). Asumimos una gama de radio circular y una conectividad simétrica. En la parte restante de la sección proponemos un modelo analítico simple que estima el rango de radio R para redes medianas conectadas (menos de 20 vecinos por R). Consideramos que se sabe lo siguiente: el tamaño del campo de despliegue (L), el número de nodos de sensores desplegados (N) Algoritmo 3 Localización 1: Estime el rango de radio R 2: Ejecute el algoritmo de relajación de la etiqueta con la función de soporte dada por la ecuación6 para vecinos de menos de R separados 3: para cada nodo sensor Ni Do 4: la identidad del nodo es λk con máx.problema5: Fin para y el número total de conexiones de radio de un salto unidireccionales (es decir, no simétricas) en la red (k). Para nuestro análisis, distribuimos de manera uniforme los nodos del sensor en un área cuadrada de longitud l, utilizando una cuadrícula de longitud de la unidad l/ √ N. Usamos la sustitución u = l/ √ n para simplificar la notación, a fin de distinguir laLos siguientes casos: si u ≤ r ≤ √ 2u, cada nodo tiene cuatro vecinos (el k = 4n esperado);Si √ 2u ≤ r ≤ 2u, cada nodo tiene ocho vecinos (el k = 8n esperado);Si 2u ≤ r ≤ √ 5U, cada nodo tiene doce vecinos (el k = 12n esperado);Si √ 5u ≤ r ≤ 3u Cada nodo tiene veinte vecinos (el k = 20n esperado) para una t = k/4n dada, tomamos R como en el medio del intervalo. Como ejemplo, si t = 5 entonces r = (3 + √ 5) u/2. Un ajuste cuadrático para R sobre los posibles valores de T, produce la siguiente solución de forma cerrada para el rango de comunicación R, en función de la conectividad de red k, suponiendo que L y N constante: r (k) = l √ n −0.051 k4n 2 +0.66 K 4n +0.6 (7) Investigamos la precisión de nuestro modelo en la Sección 5.2.1.3.3.3 Relajación con restricciones de tiempo Las limitaciones de tiempo se pueden tratar de manera similar con limitaciones de color. La identificación única de un nodo sensor se puede obtener desplegando nodos de sensor individualmente, uno por uno, y registrando una secuencia de imágenes. El nodo del sensor que se identifica como nuevo en la última imagen (no se identificó en la imagen antes de la última) debe ser el último nodo sensor. De manera similar con la relajación de la etiqueta restringida del color, el enfoque limitado por el tiempo es muy simple, pero puede llevar demasiado tiempo, especialmente para los sistemas a gran escala. Si bien se puede usar en la práctica, es poco probable que solo se use una relajación de etiqueta limitada por el tiempo. Como veremos, al combinar primitivas limitadas, se pueden implementar sistemas de localización realistas. La función de soporte para la relajación de la etiqueta con restricciones de tiempo se define de manera idéntica a la relajación de color restringida: Qs Ni (λk) = 1 (8) El algoritmo de localización (el algoritmo 2 consiste en los siguientes pasos: una etiqueta se asigna a cada nodo del sensor (líneas 1-3 del algoritmo), y con una probabilidad de probabilidad PNI (λk) = 1; el algoritmo ejecuta una sola iteración, 62 d1 d2 d4 d 3node etiqueta-1 etiqueta-2 etiqueta-3 0.2 0.1 0.5 0.2 0.2Figura 5.

Distribución de nodos Cuando la función de soporte, simplemente, reitera la confianza en el etiquetado único.3.3.4 La relajación con limitaciones de espacio información espacial relacionada con la implementación del sensor también se puede emplear como otra entrada al algoritmo de relajación de la etiqueta. Para hacer eso, usamos dos tipos de ubicaciones: la ubicación del nodo PN y la ubicación de la etiqueta PL. La PN anterior se define como la posición de los nodos (Xn, Yn, Zn) después del despliegue, que se puede obtener a través del procesamiento de imágenes como se menciona en la Sección 3.3. El último PL se define como la ubicación (XL, YL, ZL) donde se cae un nodo. Usamos DNI λM para denotar la distancia horizontal entre la ubicación de la etiqueta λm y la ubicación del nodo Ni. Claramente, dni λm = (xn −xl) 2 +(yn −yl) 2. En el momento de la liberación de un nodo del sensor, se conoce el mapeo uno a uno entre el nodo y su etiqueta. En otras palabras, la ubicación de la etiqueta es la misma que la ubicación del nodo en el momento de la liberación. Después del lanzamiento, la información de ubicación de la etiqueta se pierde parcialmente debido a los factores aleatorios como el impacto del viento y la superficie. Sin embargo, estadísticamente, las ubicaciones de los nodos están correlacionadas con las ubicaciones de las etiquetas. Dicha correlación depende de los métodos de AirDrop empleados y los entornos. En aras de la simplicidad, supongamos que los nodos se dejan caer del aire a través de un helicóptero que se cierne en el aire. El viento se puede descomponer en tres componentes X, Y y Z. Solo x e y afectan la distancia horizontal que puede viajar un nodo. Según [24], podemos suponer que X e Y siguen una distribución normal independiente. Por lo tanto, el valor absoluto de la velocidad del viento sigue una distribución de Rayleigh. Obviamente, cuanto más alta sea la velocidad del viento, más un nodo aterrizaría horizontalmente desde la ubicación de la etiqueta. Si suponemos que la distancia D es una función de la velocidad del viento V [25] [26], podemos obtener la distribución de probabilidad de D bajo una distribución de velocidad del viento dada. Sin pérdida de generalidad, suponemos que D es proporcional a la velocidad del viento. Por lo tanto, D sigue la distribución de Rayleigh también. Como se muestra en la Figura 5, la relajación espacial es un proceso recursivo para asignar la probabilidad de que un nodos tenga una determinada etiqueta utilizando las distancias entre la ubicación de un nodo con múltiples ubicaciones de etiquetas. Observamos que la distribución de la distancia D afecta la probabilidad con la que se asigna una etiqueta. No es necesariamente cierto que la etiqueta más cercana siempre se elige. Por ejemplo, si D sigue la distribución de Rayleigh (σ2), podemos obtener la función de densidad de probabilidad (PDF) de distancias como se muestra en la Figura 6. Esta figura indica que la posibilidad de que un nodo caiga verticalmente es muy pequeña en condiciones de viento (σ> 0), y que la distancia D se ve afectada por el σ. La distribución espacial de los nodos para σ = 1 se muestra en la Figura 7. El viento fuerte con un alto valor σ conduce a una dispersión de nodo más grande. Más formalmente, dada una función de densidad de probabilidad PDF (d), el soporte para la etiqueta λk del nodo del sensor Ni puede formularse como: QS Ni (λk) = PDF (DNI λk) (9) Es interesante señalar dos casos especiales. Primero, si todos los nodos se liberan a la vez (es decir, solo una ubicación de etiqueta para todos los nodos liberados), la distancia d de un nodo a todas las etiquetas es la misma. En este caso, PS+1 Ni (λk) = PS Ni (λk), lo que indica que no podemos usar la relajación basada en espacios para reducir recursivamente las etiquetas potenciales para un nodo. En segundo lugar, si los nodos se liberan en diferentes ubicaciones que están lejos entre sí, tenemos: (i) Si el nodo Ni tiene etiqueta λk, ps ni (λk) → 1 cuando s → ∞, (ii) si el nodo ni no lo hacetener etiqueta λk, ps ni (λk) → 0 cuando s → ∞. En este segundo escenario, hay múltiples etiquetas (una etiqueta por liberación), por lo tanto, es posible correlacionar los tiempos de liberación (etiquetas) con posiciones en el suelo. Estos resultados indican que la relajación espacial puede etiquetar el nodo con una probabilidad muy alta si la separación física entre los nodos es grande.3.3.5 Relajación con limitaciones de color y conectividad Una de las características más interesantes de la arquitectura de estrella es que permite construir soluciones de localización híbrida, dependiendo de los requisitos del sistema. Un ejemplo es un sistema de localización que utiliza las limitaciones de color y conectividad. En este esquema, las limitaciones de color se utilizan para reducir el número de etiquetas candidatas para los nodos de sensores, a un valor más manejable. Como recordatorio, en la relajación limitada de conectividad, todas las etiquetas son etiquetas candidatas para cada nodo del sensor. Las restricciones de color se utilizan en la fase de inicialización del algoritmo 3 (líneas 1-3). Después de la inicialización, se utiliza el algoritmo de relajación restringido de conectividad estándar. Para una mejor comprensión de cómo funciona el algoritmo de relajación de la etiqueta, damos un ejemplo concreto, ejemplificado en la Figura 8. En la parte (a) de la figura, representamos las estructuras de datos 63 11 8 4 1 12 9 7 5 3 Ni NJ 12 8 10 11 10 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 (a) 11 8 4 1 12 9 7 5 5 53 Ni NJ 12 8 10 11 10 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.32 0 0.68 0 (b) Figura 8. Un paso a través del algoritmo. Después de la inicialización (a) y después de la primera iteración para el nodo Ni (b) asociado con los nodos Ni y NJ después de los pasos de inicialización del algoritmo (líneas 1-6), así como el número de balizas entre diferentes etiquetas (como se informa porla red, a través de g (λ, e)). Como se ve, las etiquetas potenciales (que se muestran dentro de los rectángulos verticales) se asignan a cada nodo. El nodo Ni puede ser cualquiera de los siguientes: 11,8,4,1. También se muestran en la figura las probabilidades asociadas con cada una de las etiquetas. Después de la inicialización, todas las probabilidades son iguales. La parte (b) de la Figura 8 muestra el resultado de la primera iteración del algoritmo de localización para el nodo Ni, suponiendo que el nodo NJ es el primer WI elegido en la línea 7 del algoritmo 3. Al usar la ecuación 6, el algoritmo calcula el soporte Q (λi) para cada una de las etiquetas posibles para el nodo Ni. Una vez que se calculan los Q (λi) S, se puede obtener la constante de normalización, dada por la Ecuación 3. El último paso de la iteración es actualizar las probabilidades asociadas con todas las etiquetas potenciales de Node Ni, como lo indica la Ecuación 2. Un problema interesante, que exploramos en la sección de evaluación del desempeño, es evaluar el impacto que la partición del conjunto de color C tiene en la precisión de la localización. Cuando el tamaño del conjunto de colorear es menor que el número de nodos sensores (como es el caso de nuestra conectividad híbrida/relajación limitada del color), el diseñador del sistema tiene la opción de permitir que un nodo tenga un color de manera única (actuando como unancla), o múltiples nodos. Intuitivamente, asignando un color a más de un nodo, se pueden hacer cumplir más restricciones (distribuidas).3.3.6 Análisis de técnicas de relajación Las técnicas de relajación de etiquetas propuestas tienen diferentes compensaciones. Para nuestro análisis de las compensaciones, consideramos las siguientes métricas de interés: el tiempo de localización (duración), la energía consumida (gastos generales), el tamaño de la red (escala) que puede ser manejado por la técnica y la precisión de localización. Los parámetros de interés son los siguientes: el número de nodos sensores (n), la energía gastada para una caída aérea (εd), la energía gastada en la red para recopilar e informar la información de los vecinos εb y el TD TD tomado por un nodo sensorPara llegar al suelo después de ser desplegado aéreo. La comparación de costos de las diferentes técnicas de relajación de etiquetas se muestra en la Tabla 1. Como se muestra, las técnicas de relajación basadas en las limitaciones de color y espacio tienen la menor duración de localización, cero, para todos los efectos prácticos. Sin embargo, la escalabilidad de la técnica de relajación basada en el color se limita al número de (a) (b) Figura 9. Sensorball con capacidades de autosuficiencia (a) y CCR de color (b) filtros de color únicos que se pueden construir. Cuanto más estrecha sea la función de transferencia ψ (λ), mayor será el número de colores únicos que se pueden crear. Sin embargo, los costos de fabricación también están aumentando. El problema de escalabilidad se aborda por todas las demás técnicas de relajación de etiquetas. En particular, la relajación restringida del tiempo, que es muy similar a la relajación con restricciones en colonina, aborda el problema de la escala, a un costo de despliegue más alto.

La comparación de las técnicas de relajación de etiquetas 4 Implementación del sistema El marco de localización de Stardust, que se muestra en la Figura 2, es flexible ya que permite el desarrollo de nuevos sistemas de localización, basado en los cuatro esquemas de relajación de etiquetas propuestos, o la inclusión de otros, aún por inventar, pero que se inventará, aún por inventar, esquemas. Para nuestra evaluación de desempeño, implementamos una versión del marco Stardust, a saber, la propuesta en la Sección 3.3.5, donde las restricciones se basan en el color y la conectividad. El dispositivo central del sistema Stardust consta de lo siguiente: el emisor de luz: utilizamos una luz de flash común (QBEAM, 3 millones de vela);La adquisición de imágenes se realizó con una cámara digital de 3 megapíxeles (Sony DSC-S50) que proporcionó la entrada al algoritmo de procesamiento de imágenes, implementado en MATLAB. Para los nodos sensores, construimos un nodo sensor personalizado, llamado Sensorball, con capacidades de autosuficiencia, que se muestra en la Figura 9 (a). Las capacidades de autosuficiencia son necesarias para orientar el CCR predominantemente hacia arriba. Los CCR que utilizamos eran barcos, plástico moldeado, señales de advertencia nocturna comúnmente disponibles en bicicletas, como se muestra en la Figura 9 (b). Observamos aquí la baja calidad de los CCR que utilizamos. La reflectividad de cada CCR (hay decenas moldeadas en el recipiente de plástico) es extremadamente baja, y cada CCR no está construido con espejos. Se logra un efecto reflectante empleando superficies de plástico finamente pulidas. Teníamos 5 colores disponibles, además del CCR estándar, que refleja toda la luz entrante (CCR blanco). Por un precio ligeramente más alto (los nuestros eran 20 centavos/pieza), se pueden emplear CCR de mejor calidad.64 Figura 10. El campo en la oscuridad Figura 11. El campo iluminado Figura 12. La diferencia: la Figura 10 figura 11 de mayor calidad (mejores espejos) se traduciría en un procesamiento de imágenes más preciso (mejor detección de nodos del sensor) y un factor de forma más pequeño para el componente óptico (se puede usar una matriz de CCR con un área más pequeña). La plataforma de nodo del sensor que utilizamos fue el Micaz Mote. El código que se ejecuta en cada nodo es una aplicación simple que transmite 100 balizas y mantiene una tabla vecina que contiene el porcentaje de balizas recibidas con éxito, para cada vecino. A pedido, la mesa vecina se informa a una estación base, donde se realiza el mapeo de ID del nodo.5 Evaluación del sistema En esta sección presentamos la evaluación del desempeño de una implementación del sistema del marco de localización de Stardust. Las tres principales preguntas de investigación que nuestra evaluación intenta responder son: la viabilidad del marco propuesto (¿pueden detectarse ópticamente los nodos de los sensores a grandes distancias), la precisión de localización de una implementación real del marco de Stardust y si las condiciones atmosféricas pueden o no pueden o no?afectar el reconocimiento de nodos sensores en una imagen. Las dos primeras preguntas se investigan evaluando los dos componentes principales del marco Stardust: el procesamiento de la imagen y la coincidencia de ID del nodo. Estos componentes se han evaluado por separado principalmente debido a la falta de instalaciones adecuadas. Queríamos evaluar el rendimiento del algoritmo de procesamiento de imágenes en una configuración experimental realista, realista y realista, mientras que la coincidencia de ID del nodo requería un área relativamente grande, disponible por largos períodos de tiempo (para la recopilación de datos de conectividad). La tercera pregunta de investigación se investiga a través de un modelado por computadora de fenómenos atmosféricos. Para la evaluación del módulo de procesamiento de imágenes, realizamos experimentos en un estadio de fútbol donde implementamos 6 nodos sensores en una cuadrícula 3 × 2. La distancia entre el dispositivo central y los nodos del sensor es de aproximadamente 500 pies. Las métricas de interés son el número de falsos positivos y falsos negativos en el algoritmo de procesamiento de imágenes. Para la evaluación del componente de mapeo de ID del nodo, implementamos 26 nodos de sensor en un área plana de 120 × 60 pies2 de un estadio. Para investigar la influencia que tiene la conectividad de la radio en la precisión de localización, variamos la altura por encima del suelo de los nodos del sensor desplegado. Se utilizan dos configuraciones: una en la que los nodos del sensor están en el suelo y el segundo, en el que los nodos sensores se elevan a 3 pulgadas sobre el suelo. A partir de aquí, nos referiremos a estas dos configuraciones experimentales como la baja conectividad y las redes de alta conectividad, respectivamente, porque cuando los nodos están en el suelo, el rango de comunicación es bajo, lo que resulta en menos vecinos que cuando los nodos están elevados y tienen unMayor rango de comunicación. Las métricas de interés son: el error de localización (definido como la distancia entre la ubicación calculada y la ubicación verdadera, conocida por la ubicación manual), el porcentaje de nodos localizados correctamente, la convergencia del algoritmo de relajación de la etiqueta, el tiempo para localizar y localizar yLa robustez de la asignación de ID del nodo a errores en el módulo de procesamiento de imágenes. Los parámetros que variamos experimentalmente son: el ángulo bajo el cual se toman las imágenes, el enfoque de la cámara y el grado de conectividad. Los parámetros que variamos en las simulaciones (posteriores a la adquisición de imágenes y la colección de conectividad) el número de colores, el número de anclajes, el número de falsos positivos o negativos como entrada al componente de coincidencia de ID del nodo, la distancia entre el dispositivo de imagen y el sensorred (es decir, rango), condiciones atmosféricas (coeficiente de atenuación de luz) y reflectancia de CCR (indicativa de su calidad).5.1 Procesamiento de imágenes Para la evaluación de IPA, implementamos 6 nodos de sensores en una cuadrícula 3 × 2. Tomamos 13 conjuntos de imágenes utilizando diferentes orientaciones de la cámara y diferentes factores de zoom. Todas las fotos fueron tomadas de la misma ubicación. Cada set está compuesto por una foto tomada en la oscuridad y de una imagen tomada con un haz de luz apunta a los nodos. Procesamos las imágenes fuera de línea utilizando una implementación de MATLAB de IPA. Dado que estamos interesados en la viabilidad de identificar nodos de sensores de colores a gran distancia, el resultado final de nuestra IPA es la ubicación 2D de los nodos sensores (posición en la imagen). La transformación a las coordenadas 3D se puede hacer a través de técnicas estándar de gráficos por computadora [23]. Un conjunto de imágenes obtenidas como parte de nuestro experimento se muestra en las Figuras 10 y 11. La ejecución de nuestro algoritmo IPA da como resultado la Figura 12 que filtra el fondo, y la Figura 13 que muestra la salida del paso de detección de borde de IPA. Los resultados experimentales se representan en la Figura 14. Para cada conjunto de imágenes, el gráfico muestra el número de falsos positivos (el IPA determina que hay un nodo 65 Figura 13. Retrorreflectores detectados en la Figura 12 0 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Número de experimento Cuenta falsos positivos falsos negativos Figura 14. Falsos positivos y negativos para los 6 nodos mientras no hay ninguno), y el número de falsos negativos (el IPA determina que no hay nodo mientras hay uno). En aproximadamente el 45% de los casos, obtuvimos resultados perfectos, es decir, sin falsos positivos y sin falsos negativos. En los casos restantes, obtuvimos una serie de falsos positivos de la máximo de uno, y una serie de falsos negativos de como máximo dos. Excluimos dos pares de imágenes de la Figura 14. En el primer par excluido, obtenemos 42 falsos positivos y en el segundo par 10 falsos positivos y 7 falsos negativos. Al examinar cuidadosamente las imágenes, nos dimos cuenta de que el primer par fue sacado de foco y que un automóvil apareció temporalmente en una de las imágenes del segundo par. La anomalía en el segundo set se debió al hecho de que esperamos demasiado para tomar la segunda foto. Si las imágenes se hubieran tomado unas pocas milisegundos, el automóvil se habría representado en ambas o en ninguna de las imágenes y la IPA lo habría filtrado.5.2 COMPARACIÓN DE ID DE NODO Evaluamos el componente de coincidencia de ID de nodo de nuestro sistema mediante la recopilación de datos empíricos (información de conectividad) desde la implementación al aire libre de 26 nodos en el área de 120 × 60 pies2. Recopilamos 20 conjuntos de datos para la alta conectividad y las implementaciones de red de baja conectividad. Investigamos fuera de línea la influencia de la coloración en las métricas de interés, asignando colores al azar a los nodos del sensor. Para un conjunto de datos experimentales, generamos 50 asignaciones aleatorias de colores a los nodos sensores. Es importante observar que, para la evaluación del algoritmo de coincidencia de ID del nodo (color y conectividad limitada), simulamos la asignación de color a los nodos sensores. Como se mencionó en la Sección 4, el tamaño del espacio para colorear disponible para nosotros fue de 5 (5 colores). A través de simulaciones de asignación de color (no conectividad) podemos investigar la influencia que el tamaño del espacio de coloración tiene en la precisión de la localización.

El número de conexiones de radio existentes y faltantes en el experimento de alta conectividad eter ε utilizado en el algoritmo 2 fue 0.001. Los resultados presentados aquí representan promedios sobre los colores generados aleatoriamente y en todos los conjuntos de datos experimentales. Primero investigamos la precisión de nuestro modelo de radio propuesto, y posteriormente utilizamos los valores derivados para el rango de radio en la evaluación del componente de coincidencia de ID del nodo.5.2.1 Modelo de radio De los experimentos, obtenemos el número promedio de balizas observadas (K, definidas en la Sección 3.3.2) para la red de baja conectividad de 180 balizas y para la red de alta conectividad de 420 balizas. De nuestro modelo de radio (Ecuación 7, obtenemos un rango de radio R = 25 pies para la red de baja conectividad y R = 40 pies para la red de alta conectividad. Para estimar la precisión de nuestro modelo simple, trazamos el número de enlaces de radio que existen en las redes y el número de enlaces que faltan, como funciones de la distancia entre nodos. Los resultados se muestran en las Figuras 15 y 16. Definimos que el rango de radio promedio R es la distancia sobre la cual faltan menos del 20% de los enlaces de radio potenciales. Como se muestra en la Figura 15, el rango de radio es de entre 20 y 25 pies. Para la red de conectividad más alta, el rango de radio fue de entre 30 y 40 pies. Elegimos dos estimaciones conservadoras del rango de radio: 20 pies para la baja conectividadcaso y 35 pies para el caso de alta conectividad, que están en buen acuerdo con los valores predichos por nuestro modelo de radio.5.2.2 Error de localización versus tamaño de espacio para colorear En este experimento investigamos el efecto del número de colores en la precisión de localización. Para esto, asignamos aleatoriamente colores de un grupo de un tamaño dado, a los nodos del sensor.66 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 0 5 10 15 20 Número de colores localizationError [pies] r = 15 pies r = 20 pies r = 25 pies Figura 17.

Porcentaje de nodos localizados correctamente, luego ejecutamos el algoritmo de localización, que utiliza los datos empíricos. El algoritmo se ejecuta para tres rangos de radio diferentes: 15, 20 y 25 pies, para investigar su influencia en el error de localización. Los resultados se representan en la Figura 17 (error de localización) y la Figura 18 (porcentaje de nodos localizados correctamente). Como se muestra, para una estimación de 20 pies para el rango de radio (como lo predice nuestro modelo de radio) obtenemos los errores de localización más pequeños, tan pequeños como 2 pies, cuando se usan suficientes colores. Ambas figuras 17 y 18 confirman nuestra intuición de que un mayor número de colores disponibles disminuye significativamente el error en la localización. El hecho bien conocido de que los algoritmos de relajación no siempre convergen, se observó durante nuestros experimentos. El porcentaje de ejecuciones exitosas (cuando el algoritmo convergió) se representa en la Figura 19. Como se muestra, en varias situaciones, el algoritmo no pudo converger (la ejecución del algoritmo se detuvo después de 100 iteraciones por nodo). Si el algoritmo no converge en un número predeterminado de pasos, terminará y la etiqueta con la mayor probabilidad proporcionará la identidad del nodo. Es muy probable que la etiqueta elegida sea incorrecta, ya que las probabilidades de algunas de las etiquetas cambian constantemente (con cada iteración). La convergencia de los algoritmos basados en la relajación es un problema bien conocido.5.2.3 Error de localización versus singularidad de color Como se menciona en la Sección 3.3.1, un color único le da a un nodo sensor el estatuto de un ancla. Un nodo sensor que es un ancla se puede identificar inequívocamente a través del módulo de procesamiento de imágenes. En esta sección investigamos el efecto que tienen los colores únicos en la precisión de localización. Específicamente, queremos verificar experimentalmente nuestra intuición de que asignar más nodos a un color puede beneficiar la precisión de localización, al hacer cumplir más restricciones, en lugar de asignar un color de forma única a un solo nodo.90 95 100 1050 0 5 10 15 20 Número de colores Convergencerate [x100] R = 15 pies r = 20 pies r = 25 pies Figura 19.

Error de localización versus número de colores para esto, solucionamos el número de colores disponibles a 4, 6 u 8 y variamos el número de nodos que reciben colores únicos, desde 0, hasta el número máximo de colores (4, 6o 8). Naturalmente, si tenemos un número máximo de colores de 4, podemos asignar como máximo 4 anclajes. Los resultados experimentales se representan en la Figura 20 (error de localización) y la Figura 21 (porcentaje del nodo del sensor localizado correctamente). Como se esperaba, la precisión de localización aumenta con el aumento en el número de colores disponibles (espacio para colorear más grande). Además, para un tamaño dado del espacio para colorear (por ejemplo, 6 colores disponibles), si se asignan más colores a los nodos sensores, la precisión de localización disminuye. Es interesante observar que al asignar colores de manera única a los nodos, el beneficio de tener colores adicionales disminuye. Específicamente, si hay 8 colores disponibles y todos se asignan de manera única, el sistema estaría menos localizado con menos precisión (error ≈ 7 pies), en comparación con el caso de 6 colores y sin tareas únicas de colores (error de localización de 5 pies). La misma tendencia, de una localización menos precisa, se puede observar en la Figura 21, que muestra el porcentaje de nodos localizados correctamente (es decir, un error de localización de 0 pies). Como se muestra, si aumentamos el número de colores que se asignan de manera única, el porcentaje de nodos localizados correctamente disminuye.5.2.4 Error de localización versus conectividad Recopilamos datos empíricos para dos implementaciones de red con diferentes grados de conectividad (alta y baja) para evaluar la influencia de la conectividad en la precisión de la ubicación. Los resultados obtenidos de ejecutar nuestro algoritmo de localización se representan en la Figura 22 y la Figura 23. Variamos el número de colores disponibles y no asignamos anclajes (es decir, sin tareas únicas de colores). En ambos escenarios, como se esperaba, el error de localización disminuye con un aumento en el número de colores. Sin embargo, es interesante observar que el escenario de baja conectividad IM67 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 4 6 8 Número de colores %Correcto Localizado [x100] 0 Anclas 2 Anclas 4 Anchors 6 Anchors Figura 21.

El error de localización frente al número de colores demuestra la precisión de localización más rápida, desde el número adicional de colores disponibles. Cuando el número de colores se vuelve relativamente grande (doce para nuestra red de nodos de 26 sensores), ambos escenarios (conectividad baja y alta) tienen errores de localización comparables, de menos de 2 pies. La misma tendencia de información de ubicación más precisa se evidencia en la Figura 23, que muestra que el porcentaje de nodos que se localizan correctamente crecen más rápido para la baja implementación de conectividad.5.3 Error de localización vs. Errores de procesamiento de imágenes Hasta ahora investigamos las fuentes de error en la localización que son intrínsecas al componente de coincidencia de ID del nodo. Como se presentó anteriormente, los objetos luminosos pueden detectarse por error como nodos sensores durante la fase de detección de ubicación del módulo de procesamiento de imágenes. Estos falsos positivos pueden ser eliminados por el procedimiento de reconocimiento de color del módulo de procesamiento de imágenes. Más problemáticos son falsos negativos (cuando un nodo del sensor no refleja la luz suficiente para detectar). Deben ser manejados por el algoritmo de localización. En este caso, el algoritmo de localización se presenta con dos conjuntos de nodos de diferentes tamaños, que deben coincidir: uno que proviene del procesamiento de imágenes (que pierde algunos nodos) y otro proveniente de la red, con la información de conectividad (aquí nosotrosSuponga una red totalmente conectada, de modo que todos los nodos de sensores informen su información de conectividad). En este experimento investigamos cómo los errores de procesamiento de imágenes (falsos negativos) influyen en la precisión de localización. Para esta evaluación, ejecutamos nuestro algoritmo de localización con datos empíricos, pero eliminamos un porcentaje de nodos de la lista de nodos detectados por el algoritmo de procesamiento de imágenes (introdujimos artificialmente negativos falsos en el proceso de imagen 0 20 20 30 40 60 70 80 90 100 1000 2 4 6 8 10 12 Número de colores %Correcto Localizado [x100] Baja conectividad Alta conectividad Figura 23.

Impacto de falsos negativos en el error de localización). El efecto de los falsos negativos en la precisión de la localización se representa en la Figura 24. Como se ve en la figura si el número de falsos negativos es del 15%, el error en la estimación de la posición se duplica cuando hay 4 colores disponibles. Es interesante observar que el escenario cuando hay más colores disponibles (por ejemplo, 12 colores) se ve afectado de manera más drástica que el escenario con menos colores (por ejemplo, 4 colores). Todavía se está manteniendo el beneficio de tener más colores disponibles, al menos para la gama de colores que investigamos (4 a 12 colores).5.4 Tiempo de localización En esta sección, observamos más de cerca la duración de cada una de las cuatro técnicas de relajación propuestas y dos combinaciones de ellas: la conectividad de color y el tiempo de color. Suponemos que se pueden fabricar 50 filtros de color únicos, que la red de sensores se implementa a partir de 2.400 pies (necesarios para la relajación limitada por el tiempo) y que el tiempo requerido para informar la conectividad crece linealmente, con un período de informe inicial de 160 segundos, como se usa.En una aplicación de seguimiento del mundo real [1]. Los resultados de la duración de la localización, como se presentan en la Tabla 1, se representan en la Figura 25. Como se muestra, para todos los efectos prácticos, el tiempo requerido por las técnicas de relajación restringidas del espacio es de 0 segundos. Lo mismo se aplica a la relajación limitada del color, para lo cual el tiempo de localización es de 0 segundos (si el número de colores es suficiente). Teniendo en cuenta nuestros supuestos, solo para una red de tamaño 50, la relajación restringida del color funciona. La duración de la localización para todos los demás tamaños de red (100, 150 y 200) es infinita (es decir, no se pueden hacer tareas de color únicas para nodos sensores, ya que solo 50 colores son únicos), cuando solo se usa relajación limitada por color. Las técnicas limitadas de conectividad y el tiempo restringidas aumentan linealmente con el tamaño de la red (para el tiempo limitado, el dispositivo central despliega nodos sensores uno por uno, registrando una imagen después del tiempo se espera que un nodo sensor alcance el 68 0 500 1000 1500 2000 20002500 3000 Color Conectividad de conectividad Colorconencia Color Técnica de localización de tiempo Color Localización Tiempo [SEC] 50 Nodos 100 Nodos 150 nodos 200 nodos Figura 25.

Aparente contraste en un terreno de atmósfera de novatadas). Es interesante notar en la Figura 25 la mejora en el tiempo de localización obtenida simplemente combinando el color y las técnicas limitadas de conectividad. La duración de la localización en este caso es idéntica a la técnica limitada de conectividad. La combinación de relajaciones limitadas de color y tiempo es aún más interesante. Para una duración de localización razonable de 52 segundos, se puede construir un sistema de localización perfecto (es decir, 0 pies de localización). En este escenario, el conjunto de nodos sensores se divide en lotes, y cada lote tiene un conjunto de colores únicos. Sería muy interesante considerar otros escenarios, donde la fuerza de la relajación restringida del espacio (0 segundos para cualquier tamaño de la red de sensores) se utiliza para mejorar las otras técnicas de relajación propuestas. Dejamos la investigación y la rigurosa clasificación de dicha combinación de técnicas para el trabajo futuro.5.5 Rango del sistema En esta sección Evaluamos la viabilidad del marco de localización de Stardust al considerar las realidades de la propagación de la luz a través de la atmósfera. El factor principal que determina el rango de nuestro sistema es la dispersión de la luz, lo que redirige la luminancia de la fuente al medio (en esencia, afecta igualmente la luminosidad del objetivo y del fondo). La dispersión limita el rango de visibilidad al reducir el contraste aparente entre el objetivo y su fondo (se acerca a cero, a medida que aumenta la distancia). El contraste aparente Cr se expresa cuantitativamente por la fórmula: CR = (NT R −nb R)/Nb R (10) donde NT R y NB R son la radiación objetivo aparente y la radiación de fondo aparente a la distancia R de la fuente de luz, respectivamente. La radiación aparente nt r de un objetivo a una distancia r de la fuente de luz, se da por: nt r = na + iρte - 2σr πr2 (11) donde i es la intensidad de la fuente de luz, ρt es la reflectancia objetivo, σes el coeficiente de atenuación espectral (≈ 0.12 km - 1 y ≈ 0.60km - 1 para una atmósfera clara y brumosa, respectivamente) y NA es el resplandor de la retrodispersión atmosférica, y se puede expresar de la siguiente manera: Na = Gσ2i 2π 2σrz0.02σr e - x x2 dx (12) donde g = 0.24 es una ganancia de retrodispersión. La aparente radiación de fondo Nb R viene dada por fórmulas similares con las ecuaciones 11 y 12, donde solo la reflectancia objetivo ρt se sustituye con la reflectancia de fondo ρb. Es importante observar que cuando CR alcanza su límite inferior, ningún aumento en la luminancia de la fuente o la sensibilidad del receptor aumentará el rango del sistema. De las ecuaciones 11 y 12 se puede observar que el parámetro que puede controlarse e influir en el rango del sistema es ρt, la reflectancia objetivo. Las figuras 26 y 27 representan el contraste aparente en función de la distancia r para una atmósfera clara y brumosa, respectivamente. El contraste aparente se investiga para los coeficientes de reflectancia ρt que varían de 0.3 a 1.0 (reflector perfecto). Para un contraste C de al menos 0.5, como se puede ver en la Figura 26, se puede lograr un rango de aproximadamente 4,500 pies si la atmósfera es clara. El rendimiento se deteriora dramáticamente, cuando las condiciones atmosféricas son problemáticas. Como se muestra en la Figura 27, se puede lograr un rango de hasta 1.500 pies, cuando se usa componentes de CCR altamente reflectantes. Si bien nuestra fuente de luz (3 millones de vela) fue suficiente para un rango de unos pocos cientos de pies, comentamos que existen fuentes de luz disponibles comercialmente (20 millones de vela) o militares (150 millones de vela [27]), lo suficientemente potentes para los rangos de los rangos deunos pocos miles de pies.6 Optimizaciones del sistema Stardust En esta sección describimos extensiones de la arquitectura propuesta que pueden constituir futuras direcciones de investigación.6.1 Primitivas de restricción encadenada En este documento propusimos cuatro primitivas para algoritmos de relajación basados en restricciones: color, conectividad, tiempo y espacio. Para demostrar el poder que se puede obtener combinándolos, propusimos y evaluamos una combinación de tales primitivas: color y conectividad. Una interesante dirección de investigación para perseguir podría ser encadenar a más de dos de estas primitivas. Un ejemplo de dicha cadena es: color, temporal, espacial y conectividad. Otras instrucciones de investigación podrían ser utilizar el esquema de votación para decidir qué primitivos usar o asignar diferentes pesos a diferentes algoritmos de relajación.69 6.2 Aprendizaje de ubicación Si después de varias iteraciones del algoritmo, ninguna de las probabilidades de etiqueta para un nodo Ni converge a un valor más alto, la confianza en nuestro etiquetado de ese nodo es relativamente baja. Sería interesante asociarse con un nodo, más de una etiqueta (implícitamente más de una ubicación) y diferir la decisión de asignación de etiquetas hasta que los eventos se detecten en la red (si la red se implementó para el seguimiento de objetivos).6.3 Localización en entornos resistentes La fuerza impulsora inicial para el marco de localización de Stardust fue abordar la localización del nodo del sensor en entornos extremadamente resistentes. Toldos, vegetación densa, entornos extremadamente obstructivos plantean desafíos significativos para la localización de nodos de sensores. La esperanza, y nuestra idea original, era considerar el período de tiempo entre el despliegue aéreo y el momento en que el nodo del sensor desaparece debajo del dosel. Al registrar la última posición visible de un nodo sensor (como se ve en la aeronave) se puede obtener una estimación razonable de la ubicación del nodo del sensor. Esto requeriría que los nodos sensores posean capacidades de autosuficiencia, mientras que en el aire. Sin embargo, observamos la idoneidad de nuestro marco de localización para entornos resistentes y sin línea de visión.7 Conclusiones Stardust resuelve el problema de localización para las implementaciones aéreas donde se requiere pasividad, bajo costo, factor de forma pequeña y localización rápida. Los resultados muestran que la precisión puede estar dentro de 2 pies y el tiempo de localización dentro de los milisegundos. Stardust también muestra robustez con respecto a los errores. Predecimos la influencia de las condiciones atmosféricas que pueden tener en el rango de un sistema basado en el marco de Stardust, y mostramos que los entornos brumosos o la luz del día pueden plantear desafíos significativos. Lo más importante es que las propiedades de Stardust admiten el potencial de soluciones de localización aún más precisas, así como soluciones para entornos resistentes y sin línea de visión.8 referencias [1] T.

        "A very common and inexpensive implementation of an array of CCRs is the retroreflective plastic material used on cars and bicycles for night time detection, shown in Figure 1(b).",

        "The sensor nodes, equipped with CCRs and optical filters (acting as coloring devices) have self-righting capabilities and retroreflect the incoming strobe light.",
        "The retro-reflected light is either white, as the originating source light, or colored, due to optical filters. • The aerial vehicle records a sequence of two images very close in time (msec level).",
        "One image is taken when the strobe light is on, the other when the strobe light is off.",

        "The StarDust system architecture ages; d) by controlling the location where a sensor node is deployed. • The computed locations are disseminated to the sensor network.",
        "The architecture of the StarDust system is shown in Figure 2.",
        "The architecture consists of two main components: the first is centralized and it is located on a more powerful device.",
        "The second is distributed and it resides on all sensor nodes.",
        "The Central Device consists of the following: the Light Emitter, the Image Processing module, the Node ID Mapping module and the Radio Model.",
        "The distributed component of the architecture is the Transfer Function, which acts as a filter for the incoming light.",
        "The aforementioned modules are briefly described below: • Light Emitter - It is a strobe light, capable of producing very intense, collimated light pulses.",
        "The emitted light is non-monochromatic (unlike a laser) and it is characterized by a spectral density Ψ(λ), a function of the wavelength.",
        "The emitted light is incident on the CCRs present on sensor nodes. • Transfer Function Φ(Ψ(λ)) - This is a bandpass filter for the incident light on the CCR.",
        "The filter allows a portion of the original spectrum, to be retro-reflected.",
        "From here on, we will refer to the transfer function as the color of a sensor node. • Image Processing - The Image Processing module acquires high resolution images.",
        "From these images the locations and the colors of sensor nodes are obtained.",
        "If only one set of pictures can be taken (i.e., one location of the light emitter/image analysis device), then the map of the field is assumed to be known as well as the distance between the imaging device and the field.",
        "The aforementioned assumptions (field map and distance to it) are not necessary if the images can be simultaneously taken from different locations.",
        "It is important to remark here that the identity of a node can not be directly obtained through Image Processing alone, unless a specific characteristic of a sensor node can be identified in the image. • Node ID Matching - This module uses the detected locations and through additional techniques (e.g., sensor node coloring and connectivity information (G(Λ,E)) from the deployed network) to uniquely identify the sensor nodes observed in the image.",

        "It is only used by node ID matching techniques that are based on the radio connectivity in the network.",
        "The estimate of the radio range R is based on the sensor node density (obtained through the Image Processing module) and the connectivity information (i.e., G(Λ,E)).",
        "The two main components of the StarDust architecture are the Image Processing and the Node ID Mapping.",
        "Their design and analysis is presented in the sections that follow. 3.2 Image Processing The goal of the Image Processing Algorithm (IPA) is to identify the location of the nodes and their color.",
        "Note that IPA does not identify which node fell where, but only what is the set of locations where the nodes fell.",
        "IPA is executed after an aerial vehicle records two pictures: one in which the field of deployment is illuminated and one when no illuminations is present.",
        "Let Pdark be the picture of the deployment area, taken when no light was emitted and Plight be the picture of the same deployment area when a strong light beam was directed towards the sensor nodes.",
        "The proposed IPA has several steps, as shown in Algorithm 1.",
        "The first step is to obtain a third picture Pfilter where only the differences between Pdark and Plight remain.",
        "Let us assume that Pdark has a resolution of n × m, where n is the number of pixels in a row of the picture, while m is the number of pixels in a column of the picture.",
        "Then Pdark is composed of n × m pixels noted Pdark(i, j), i ∈ 1 ≤ i ≤ n,1 ≤ j ≤ m. Similarly Plight is composed of n × m pixels noted Plight(i, j), 1 ≤ i ≤ n,1 ≤ j ≤ m. Each pixel P is described by an RGB value where the R value is denoted by PR, the G value is denoted by PG, and the B value is denoted by PB.",
        "IPA then generates the third picture, Pfilter, through the following transformations: PR filter(i, j) = PR light(i, j)−PR dark(i, j) PG filter(i, j) = PG light(i, j)−PG dark(i, j) PB filter(i, j) = PB light(i, j)−PB dark(i, j) (1) After this transformation, all the features that appeared in both Pdark and Plight are removed from Pfilter.",
        "This simplifies the recognition of light retro-reflected by sensor nodes.",
        "The second step consists of identifying the elements contained in Pfilter that retro-reflect light.",
        "For this, an intensity filter is applied to Pfilter.",
        "First IPA converts Pfilter into a grayscale picture.",
        "Then the brightest pixels are identified and used to create Preflect.",
        "This step is eased by the fact that the reflecting nodes should appear much brighter than any other illuminated object in the picture.",

        "Standard computer graphics techniques [23] are then used to transform the 2D locations of sensor nodes detected in multiple images into 3D sensor node locations.",
        "The color of the node is obtained as the color of the pixel located at (x,y) in Plight. 3.3 Node ID Matching The goal of the Node ID Matching module is to obtain the identity (node ID) of a luminous spot in the image, detected to be a sensor node.",
        "For this, we define V = {(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(xm,ym)} to be the set of locations of the sensor nodes, as detected by the Image Processing module and Λ = {λ1,λ2,...,λm} to be the set of unique node IDs assigned to the m sensor nodes, before deployment.",
        "From here on, we refer to node IDs as labels.",
        "We model the problem of finding the label λj of a node ni as a probabilistic label relaxation problem, frequently used in image processing/understanding.",

        "The goal of scene labeling is to assign a label to each object detected in an image, such that an appropriate image interpretation is achieved.",
        "It is prohibitively expensive to consider the interactions among all the objects in an image.",
        "Instead, constraints placed among nearby objects generate local consistencies and through iteration, global consistencies can be obtained.",
        "The main idea of the sensor node localization through probabilistic label relaxation is to iteratively compute the probability of each label being the correct label for a sensor node, by taking into account, at each iteration, the support for a label.",
        "The support for a label can be understood as a hint or proof, that a particular label is more likely to be the correct one, when compared with the other potential labels for a sensor node.",
        "We pictorially depict this main idea in Figure 3.",
        "As shown, node ni has a set of candidate labels {λ1,...,λk}.",
        "Each of the labels has a different value for the Support function Q(λk).",
        "We defer the explanation of how the Support function is implemented until the subsections that follow, where we provide four concrete techniques.",

        "The pseudo-code is shown in Algorithm 2.",
        "It initializes the probabilities associated with each possible label, for a node ni, through a uniform distribution.",
        "At each iteration s, the algorithm updates the probability associated with each label, by considering the Support Qs ni (λk) for each candidate label of a sensor node.",
        "In the sections that follow, we describe four different techniques for implementing the Support function: based on node coloring, radio connectivity, the time of deployment (time) and the location of deployment (space).",
        "While some of these techniques are simplistic, they are primitives which, when combined, can create powerful localization systems.",
        "These design techniques have different trade-offs, which we will present in Section 3.3.6. 3.3.1 Relaxation with Color Constraints The unique mapping between a sensor nodes position (identified by the image processing) and a label can be obtained by assigning a unique color to each sensor node.",
        "For this we define C = {c1,c2,...,cn} to be the set of unique colors available and M : Λ → C to be a one-to-one mapping of labels to colors.",
        "This mapping is known prior to the sensor node deployment (from node manufacturing).",
        "In the case of color constrained label relaxation, the support for label λk is expressed as follows: Qs ni (λk) = 1 (5) As a result, the label relaxation algorithm (Algorithm 2) consists of the following steps: one label is assigned to each sensor node (lines 1-3 of the algorithm), implicitly having a probability Pni(λk) = 1 ; the algorithm executes a single iteration, when the support function, simply, reiterates the confidence in the unique labeling.",
        "However, it is often the case that unique colors for each node will not be available.",
        "It is interesting to discuss here the influence that the size of the coloring space (i.e., |C|) has on the accuracy of the localization algorithm.",
        "Several cases are discussed below: • If |C| = 0, no colors are used and the sensor nodes are equipped with simple CCRs that reflect back all the incoming light (i.e., no filtering, and no coloring of the incoming light).",
        "From the image processing system, the position of sensor nodes can still be obtained.",
        "Since all nodes appear white, no single sensor node can be uniquely identified. • If |C| = m − 1 then there are enough unique colors for all nodes (one node remains white, i.e. no coloring), the problem is trivially solved.",
        "Each node can be identified, based on its unique color.",
        "This is the scenario for the relaxation with color constraints. • If |C| ≥ 1, there are several options for how to partition the coloring space.",
        "If C = {c1} one possibility is to assign the color c1 to a single node, and leave the remaining m−1 sensor nodes white, or to assign the color c1 to more than one sensor node.",
        "One can observe that once a color is assigned uniquely to a sensor node, in effect, that sensor node is given the status of anchor, or node with known location.",
        "It is interesting to observe that there is an entire spectrum of possibilities for how to partition the set of sensor nodes in equivalence classes (where an equivalence class is represented by one color), in order to maximize the success of the localization algorithm.",
        "One of the goals of this paper is to understand how the size of the coloring space and its partitioning affect localization accuracy.",
        "Despite the simplicity of this method of constraining the set of labels that can be assigned to a node, we will show that this technique is very powerful, when combined with other relaxation techniques. 3.3.2 Relaxation with Connectivity Constraints Connectivity information, obtained from the sensor network through beaconing, can provide additional information for locating sensor nodes.",
        "In order to gather connectivity information, the following need to occur: 1) after deployment, through beaconing of HELLO messages, sensor nodes build their neighborhood tables; 2) each node sends its neighbor table information to the Central device via a base station.",
        "First, let us define G = (Λ,E) to be the weighted connectivity graph built by the Central device from the received neighbor table information.",
        "In G the edge (λi,λj) has a 61 λ1 λ2 ... λN ni nj gi2,j2 λ1 λ2 ... λN Pj,λ1 Pj,λ2 ... Pj,λN Pi,λ1 Pi,λ1 ... Pi,λN gi2,jm Figure 4.",

        "The confidence in each of the candidate labels for a sensor node, is represented by a probability, shown in a dotted rectangle.",
        "It is important to remark that through beaconing and the reporting of neighbor tables to the Central Device, a global view of all constraints in the network can be obtained.",
        "It is critical to observe that these constraints are among labels.",
        "As shown in Figure 4 two constraints exist between nodes ni and nj.",
        "The constraints are depicted by gi2,j2 and gi2,jM, the number of beacons sent the labels λj2 and λjM and received by the label λi2.",
        "The support for the label λk of sensor node ni, resulting from the interaction (i.e., within radio range) with sensor node nj is given by: Qs ni (λk) = M ∑ m=1 gλkλm Ps nj (λm) (6) As a result, the localization algorithm (Algorithm 3 consists of the following steps: all labels are assigned to each sensor node (lines 1-3 of the algorithm), and implicitly each label has a probability initialized to Pni(λk) = 1/|Λ|; in each iteration, the probabilities for the labels of a sensor node are updated, when considering the interaction with the labels of sensor nodes within R. It is important to remark that the identity of the nodes within R is not known, only the candidate labels and their probabilities.",
        "The relaxation algorithm converges when, during an iteration, the probability of no label is updated by more than ε.",
        "The label relaxation algorithm based on connectivity constraints, enforces such constraints between pairs of sensor nodes.",
        "For a large scale sensor network deployment, it is not feasible to consider all pairs of sensor nodes in the network.",

        "We assume a circular radio range and a symmetric connectivity.",

        "For our analysis, we uniformly distribute the sensor nodes in a square area of length L, by using a grid of unit length L/ √ N. We use the substitution u = L/ √ N to simplify the notation, in order to distinguish the following cases: if u ≤ R ≤ √ 2u each node has four neighbors (the expected k = 4N); if √ 2u ≤ R ≤ 2u each node has eight neighbors (the expected k = 8N); if 2u ≤ R ≤ √ 5u each node has twelve neighbors ( the expected k = 12N); if √ 5u ≤ R ≤ 3u each node has twenty neighbors (the expected k = 20N) For a given t = k/4N we take R to be the middle of the interval.",

        "The unique identification of a sensor node can be obtained by deploying sensor nodes individually, one by one, and recording a sequence of images.",
        "The sensor node that is identified as new in the last picture (it was not identified in the picture before last) must be the last sensor node dropped.",

        "The former pn is defined as the position of nodes (xn,yn,zn) after deployment, which can be obtained through Image Processing as mentioned in Section 3.3.",
        "The latter pl is defined as the location (xl,yl,zl) where a node is dropped.",

        "After release, the label location information is partially lost due to the random factors such as wind and surface impact.",
        "However, statistically, the node locations are correlated with label locations.",
        "Such correlation depends on the airdrop methods employed and environments.",
        "For the sake of simplicity, lets assume nodes are dropped from the air through a helicopter hovering in the air.",

        "Only X and Y affect the horizontal distance a node can travel.",
        "According to [24], we can assume that X and Y follow an independent normal distribution.",
        "Therefore, the absolute value of the wind speed follows a Rayleigh distribution.",
        "Obviously the higher the wind speed is, the further a node would land away horizontally from the label location.",
        "If we assume that the distance D is a function of the wind speed V [25] [26], we can obtain the probability distribution of D under a given wind speed distribution.",
        "Without loss of generality, we assume that D is proportional to the wind speed.",
        "Therefore, D follows the Rayleigh distribution as well.",
        "As shown in Figure 5, the spatial-based relaxation is a recursive process to assign the probability that a nodes has a certain label by using the distances between the location of a node with multiple label locations.",
        "We note that the distribution of distance D affects the probability with which a label is assigned.",
        "It is not necessarily true that the nearest label is always chosen.",
        "For example, if D follows the Rayleigh(σ2) distribution, we can obtain the Probability Density Function (PDF) of distances as shown in Figure 6.",
        "This figure indicates that the possibility of a node to fall vertically is very small under windy conditions (σ > 0), and that the distance D is affected by the σ.",
        "The spatial distribution of nodes for σ = 1 is shown in Figure 7.",
        "Strong wind with a high σ value leads to a larger node dispersion.",
        "More formally, given a probability density function PDF(D), the support for label λk of sensor node ni can be formulated as: Qs ni (λk) = PDF(Dni λk ) (9) It is interesting to point out two special cases.",
        "First, if all nodes are released at once (i.e., only one label location for all released nodes), the distance D from a node to all labels is the same.",
        "In this case, Ps+1 ni (λk) = Ps ni (λk), which indicates that we can not use the spatial-based relaxation to recursively narrow down the potential labels for a node.",
        "Second, if nodes are released at different locations that are far away from each other, we have: (i) If node ni has label λk, Ps ni (λk) → 1 when s → ∞, (ii) If node ni does not have label λk, Ps ni (λk) → 0 when s → ∞.",
        "In this second scenario, there are multiple labels (one label per release), hence it is possible to correlate release times (labels) with positions on the ground.",
        "These results indicate that spatial-based relaxation can label the node with a very high probability if the physical separation among nodes is large. 3.3.5 Relaxation with Color and Connectivity Constraints One of the most interesting features of the StarDust architecture is that it allows for hybrid localization solutions to be built, depending on the system requirements.",
        "One example is a localization system that uses the color and connectivity constraints.",
        "In this scheme, the color constraints are used for reducing the number of candidate labels for sensor nodes, to a more manageable value.",

        "When the size of the coloring set is smaller than the number of sensor nodes (as it is the case for our hybrid connectivity/color constrained relaxation), the system designer has the option of allowing one node to uniquely have a color (acting as an anchor), or multiple nodes.",
        "Intuitively, by assigning one color to more than one node, more constraints (distributed) can be enforced. 3.3.6 Relaxation Techniques Analysis The proposed label relaxation techniques have different trade-offs.",
        "For our analysis of the trade-offs, we consider the following metrics of interest: the localization time (duration), the energy consumed (overhead), the network size (scale) that can be handled by the technique and the localization accuracy.",
        "The parameters of interest are the following: the number of sensor nodes (N), the energy spent for one aerial drop (εd), the energy spent in the network for collecting and reporting neighbor information εb and the time Td taken by a sensor node to reach the ground after being aerially deployed.",
        "The cost comparison of the different label relaxation techniques is shown in Table 1.",
        "As shown, the relaxation techniques based on color and space constraints have the lowest localization duration, zero, for all practical purposes.",

        "The three major research questions that our evaluation tries to answer are: the feasibility of the proposed framework (can sensor nodes be optically detected at large distances), the localization accuracy of one actual implementation of the StarDust framework, and whether or not atmospheric conditions can affect the recognition of sensor nodes in an image.",
        "The first two questions are investigated by evaluating the two main components of the StarDust framework: the Image Processing and the Node ID Matching.",
        "These components have been evaluated separately mainly because of lack of adequate facilities.",
        "We wanted to evaluate the performance of the Image Processing Algorithm in a long range, realistic, experimental set-up, while the Node ID Matching required a relatively large area, available for long periods of time (for connectivity data gathering).",
        "The third research question is investigated through a computer modeling of atmospheric phenomena.",
        "For the evaluation of the Image Processing module, we performed experiments in a football stadium where we deploy 6 sensor nodes in a 3×2 grid.",
        "The distance between the Central device and the sensor nodes is approximately 500 ft.",
        "The metrics of interest are the number of false positives and false negatives in the Image Processing Algorithm.",
        "For the evaluation of the Node ID Mapping component, we deploy 26 sensor nodes in an 120 × 60 ft2 flat area of a stadium.",
        "In order to investigate the influence the radio connectivity has on localization accuracy, we vary the height above ground of the deployed sensor nodes.",
        "Two set-ups are used: one in which the sensor nodes are on the ground, and the second one, in which the sensor nodes are raised 3 inches above ground.",
        "From here on, we will refer to these two experimental set-ups as the low connectivity and the high connectivity networks, respectively because when nodes are on the ground the communication range is low resulting in less neighbors than when the nodes are elevated and have a greater communication range.",
        "The metrics of interest are: the localization error (defined as the distance between the computed location and the true location - known from the manual placement), the percentage of nodes correctly localized, the convergence of the label relaxation algorithm, the time to localize and the robustness of the node ID mapping to errors in the Image Processing module.",
        "The parameters that we vary experimentally are: the angle under which images are taken, the focus of the camera, and the degree of connectivity.",
        "The parameters that we vary in simulations (subsequent to image acquisition and connectivity collection) the number of colors, the number of anchors, the number of false positives or negatives as input to the Node ID Matching component, the distance between the imaging device and sensor network (i.e., range), atmospheric conditions (light attenuation coefficient) and CCR reflectance (indicative of its quality). 5.1 Image Processing For the IPA evaluation, we deploy 6 sensor nodes in a 3 × 2 grid.",
        "We take 13 sets of pictures using different orientations of the camera and different zooming factors.",
        "All pictures were taken from the same location.",
        "Each set is composed of a picture taken in the dark and of a picture taken with a light beam pointed at the nodes.",
        "We process the pictures offline using a Matlab implementation of IPA.",
        "Since we are interested in the feasibility of identifying colored sensor nodes at large distance, the end result of our IPA is the 2D location of sensor nodes (position in the image).",
        "The transformation to 3D coordinates can be done through standard computer graphics techniques [23].",
        "One set of pictures obtained as part of our experiment is shown in Figures 10 and 11.",
        "The execution of our IPA algorithm results in Figure 12 which filters out the background, and Figure 13 which shows the output of the edge detection step of IPA.",
        "The experimental results are depicted in Figure 14.",
        "For each set of pictures the graph shows the number of false positives (the IPA determines that there is a node 65 Figure 13.",
        "Retroreflectors detected in Figure 12 0 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Experiment Number Count False Positives False Negatives Figure 14.",
        "False Positives and Negatives for the 6 nodes while there is none), and the number of false negatives (the IPA determines that there is no node while there is one).",
        "In about 45% of the cases, we obtained perfect results, i.e., no false positives and no false negatives.",
        "In the remaining cases, we obtained a number of false positives of at most one, and a number of false negatives of at most two.",
        "We exclude two pairs of pictures from Figure 14.",
        "In the first excluded pair, we obtain 42 false positives and in the second pair 10 false positives and 7 false negatives.",
        "By carefully examining the pictures, we realized that the first pair was taken out of focus and that a car temporarily appeared in one of the pictures of the second pair.",
        "The anomaly in the second set was due to the fact that we waited too long to take the second picture.",
        "If the pictures had been taken a few milliseconds apart, the car would have been represented on either both or none of the pictures and the IPA would have filtered it out. 5.2 Node ID Matching We evaluate the Node ID Matching component of our system by collecting empirical data (connectivity information) from the outdoor deployment of 26 nodes in the 120×60 ft2 area.",
        "We collect 20 sets of data for the high connectivity and low connectivity network deployments.",
        "Off-line we investigate the influence of coloring on the metrics of interest, by randomly assigning colors to the sensor nodes.",
        "For one experimental data set we generate 50 random assignments of colors to sensor nodes.",
        "It is important to observe that, for the evaluation of the Node ID Matching algorithm (color and connectivity constrained), we simulate the color assignment to sensor nodes.",
        "As mentioned in Section 4 the size of the coloring space available to us was 5 (5 colors).",
        "Through simulations of color assignment (not connectivity) we are able to investigate the influence that the size of the coloring space has on the accuracy of localization.",

        "We first investigate the accuracy of our proposed Radio Model, and subsequently use the derived values for the radio range in the evaluation of the Node ID matching component. 5.2.1 Radio Model From experiments, we obtain the average number of observed beacons (k, defined in Section 3.3.2) for the low connectivity network of 180 beacons and for the high connectivity network of 420 beacons.",
        "From our Radio Model (Equation 7, we obtain a radio range R = 25 ft for the low connectivity network and R = 40 ft for the high connectivity network.",
        "To estimate the accuracy of our simple model, we plot the number of radio links that exist in the networks, and the number of links that are missing, as functions of the distance between nodes.",
        "The results are shown in Figures 15 and 16.",
        "We define the average radio range R to be the distance over which less than 20% of potential radio links, are missing.",
        "As shown in Figure 15, the radio range is between 20 ft and 25 ft. For the higher connectivity network, the radio range was between 30 ft and 40 ft. We choose two conservative estimates of the radio range: 20 ft for the low connectivity case and 35 ft for the high connectivity case, which are in good agreement with the values predicted by our Radio Model. 5.2.2 Localization Error vs. Coloring Space Size In this experiment we investigate the effect of the number of colors on the localization accuracy.",
        "For this, we randomly assign colors from a pool of a given size, to the sensor nodes. 66 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 0 5 10 15 20 Number of Colors LocalizationError[feet] R=15feet R=20feet R=25feet Figure 17.",

        "Percentage of nodes correctly localized We then execute the localization algorithm, which uses the empirical data.",
        "The algorithm is run for three different radio ranges: 15, 20 and 25 ft, to investigate its influence on the localization error.",
        "The results are depicted in Figure 17 (localization error) and Figure 18 (percentage of nodes correctly localized).",
        "As shown, for an estimate of 20 ft for the radio range (as predicted by our Radio Model) we obtain the smallest localization errors, as small as 2 ft, when enough colors are used.",
        "Both Figures 17 and 18 confirm our intuition that a larger number of colors available significantly decrease the error in localization.",
        "The well known fact that relaxation algorithms do not always converge, was observed during our experiments.",
        "The percentage of successful runs (when the algorithm converged) is depicted in Figure 19.",
        "As shown, in several situations, the algorithm failed to converge (the algorithm execution was stopped after 100 iterations per node).",
        "If the algorithm does not converge in a predetermined number of steps, it will terminate and the label with the highest probability will provide the identity of the node.",
        "It is very probable that the chosen label is incorrect, since the probabilities of some of labels are constantly changing (with each iteration).The convergence of relaxation based algorithms is a well known issue. 5.2.3 Localization Error vs. Color Uniqueness As mentioned in the Section 3.3.1, a unique color gives a sensor node the statute of an anchor.",
        "A sensor node that is an anchor can unequivocally be identified through the Image Processing module.",
        "In this section we investigate the effect unique colors have on the localization accuracy.",
        "Specifically, we want to experimentally verify our intuition that assigning more nodes to a color can benefit the localization accuracy, by enforcing more constraints, as opposed to uniquely assigning a color to a single node. 90 95 100 105 0 5 10 15 20 Number of Colors ConvergenceRate[x100] R=15feet R=20feet R=25feet Figure 19.",

        "Localization error vs. number of colors For this, we fix the number of available colors to either 4, 6 or 8 and vary the number of nodes that are given unique colors, from 0, up to the maximum number of colors (4, 6 or 8).",
        "Naturally, if we have a maximum number of colors of 4, we can assign at most 4 anchors.",
        "The experimental results are depicted in Figure 20 (localization error) and Figure 21 (percentage of sensor node correctly localized).",
        "As expected, the localization accuracy increases with the increase in the number of colors available (larger coloring space).",
        "Also, for a given size of the coloring space (e.g., 6 colors available), if more colors are uniquely assigned to sensor nodes then the localization accuracy decreases.",
        "It is interesting to observe that by assigning colors uniquely to nodes, the benefit of having additional colors is diminished.",
        "Specifically, if 8 colors are available and all are assigned uniquely, the system would be less accurately localized (error ≈ 7 ft), when compared to the case of 6 colors and no unique assignments of colors (≈ 5 ft localization error).",
        "The same trend, of a less accurate localization can be observed in Figure 21, which shows the percentage of nodes correctly localized (i.e., 0 ft localization error).",
        "As shown, if we increase the number of colors that are uniquely assigned, the percentage of nodes correctly localized decreases. 5.2.4 Localization Error vs. Connectivity We collected empirical data for two network deployments with different degrees of connectivity (high and low) in order to assess the influence of connectivity on location accuracy.",
        "The results obtained from running our localization algorithm are depicted in Figure 22 and Figure 23.",
        "We varied the number of colors available and assigned no anchors (i.e., no unique assignments of colors).",
        "In both scenarios, as expected, localization error decrease with an increase in the number of colors.",
        "It is interesting to observe, however, that the low connectivity scenario im67 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 4 6 8 Number of Colors %CorrectLocalized[x100] 0 anchors 2 anchors 4 anchors 6 anchors 8 anchors Figure 21.",

        "Localization error vs. number of colors proves the localization accuracy quicker, from the additional number of colors available.",
        "When the number of colors becomes relatively large (twelve for our 26 sensor node network), both scenarios (low and high connectivity) have comparable localization errors, of less that 2 ft.",
        "The same trend of more accurate location information is evidenced by Figure 23 which shows that the percentage of nodes that are localized correctly grows quicker for the low connectivity deployment. 5.3 Localization Error vs.",
        "Image Processing Errors So far we investigated the sources for error in localization that are intrinsic to the Node ID Matching component.",
        "As previously presented, luminous objects can be mistakenly detected to be sensor nodes during the location detection phase of the Image Processing module.",
        "These false positives can be eliminated by the color recognition procedure of the Image Processing module.",
        "More problematic are false negatives (when a sensor node does not reflect back enough light to be detected).",
        "They need to be handled by the localization algorithm.",
        "In this case, the localization algorithm is presented with two sets of nodes of different sizes, that need to be matched: one coming from the Image Processing (which misses some nodes) and one coming from the network, with the connectivity information (here we assume a fully connected network, so that all sensor nodes report their connectivity information).",
        "In this experiment we investigate how Image Processing errors (false negatives) influence the localization accuracy.",
        "For this evaluation, we ran our localization algorithm with empirical data, but dropped a percentage of nodes from the list of nodes detected by the Image Processing algorithm (we artificially introduced false negatives in the Image Process0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Number of Colors %CorrectLocalized[x100] Low Connectivity High Connectivity Figure 23.",

        "Impact of false negatives on the localization error ing).",
        "The effect of false negatives on localization accuracy is depicted in Figure 24.",
        "As seen in the figure if the number of false negatives is 15%, the error in position estimation doubles when 4 colors are available.",
        "It is interesting to observe that the scenario when more colors are available (e.g., 12 colors) is being affected more drastically than the scenario with less colors (e.g., 4 colors).",
        "The benefit of having more colors available is still being maintained, at least for the range of colors we investigated (4 through 12 colors). 5.4 Localization Time In this section we look more closely at the duration for each of the four proposed relaxation techniques and two combinations of them: color-connectivity and color-time.",
        "We assume that 50 unique color filters can be manufactured, that the sensor network is deployed from 2,400 ft (necessary for the time-constrained relaxation) and that the time required for reporting connectivity grows linearly, with an initial reporting period of 160sec, as used in a real world tracking application [1].",
        "The localization duration results, as presented in Table 1, are depicted in Figure 25.",
        "As shown, for all practical purposes the time required by the space constrained relaxation techniques is 0sec.",
        "The same applies to the color constrained relaxation, for which the localization time is 0sec (if the number of colors is sufficient).",
        "Considering our assumptions, only for a network of size 50 the color constrained relaxation works.",
        "The localization duration for all other network sizes (100, 150 and 200) is infinite (i.e., unique color assignments to sensor nodes can not be made, since only 50 colors are unique), when only color constrained relaxation is used.",
        "Both the connectivity constrained and time constrained techniques increase linearly with the network size (for the time constrained, the Central device deploys sensor nodes one by one, recording an image after the time a sensor node is expected to reach the 68 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 Color Connectivity Time Space ColorConenctivity Color-Time Localization technique Localizationtime[sec] 50 nodes 100 nodes 150 nodes 200 nodes Figure 25.",

        "Apparent contrast in a hazing atmosphere ground).",
        "It is interesting to notice in Figure 25 the improvement in the localization time obtained by simply combining the color and the connectivity constrained techniques.",
        "The localization duration in this case is identical with the connectivity constrained technique.",
        "The combination of color and time constrained relaxations is even more interesting.",
        "For a reasonable localization duration of 52seconds a perfect (i.e., 0 ft localization error) localization system can be built.",
        "In this scenario, the set of sensor nodes is split in batches, with each batch having a set of unique colors.",
        "It would be very interesting to consider other scenarios, where the strength of the space constrained relaxation (0sec for any sensor network size) is used for improving the other proposed relaxation techniques.",
        "We leave the investigation and rigorous classification of such technique combination for future work. 5.5 System Range In this section we evaluate the feasibility of the StarDust localization framework when considering the realities of light propagation through the atmosphere.",
        "The main factor that determines the range of our system is light scattering, which redirects the luminance of the source into the medium (in essence equally affecting the luminosity of the target and of the background).",
        "Scattering limits the visibility range by reducing the apparent contrast between the target and its background (approaches zero, as the distance increases).",
        "The apparent contrast Cr is quantitatively expressed by the formula: Cr = (Nt r −Nb r )/Nb r (10) where Nt r and Nb r are the apparent target radiance and apparent background radiance at distance r from the light source, respectively.",
        "The apparent radiance Nt r of a target at a distance r from the light source, is given by: Nt r = Na + Iρte−2σr πr2 (11) where I is the intensity of the light source, ρt is the target reflectance, σ is the spectral attenuation coefficient (≈ 0.12km−1 and ≈ 0.60km−1 for a clear and a hazy atmosphere, respectively) and Na is the radiance of the atmospheric backscatter, and it can be expressed as follows: Na = Gσ2I 2π 2σrZ 0.02σr e−x x2 dx (12) where G = 0.24 is a backscatter gain.",
        "The apparent background radiance Nb r is given by formulas similar with Equations 11 and 12, where only the target reflectance ρt is substituted with the background reflectance ρb.",
        "It is important to remark that when Cr reaches its lower limit, no increase in the source luminance or receiver sensitivity will increase the range of the system.",
        "From Equations 11 and 12 it can be observed that the parameter which can be controlled and can influence the range of the system is ρt, the target reflectance.",
        "Figures 26 and 27 depict the apparent contrast Cr as a function of the distance r for a clear and for a hazy atmosphere, respectively.",
        "The apparent contrast is investigated for reflectance coefficients ρt ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 (perfect reflector).",
        "For a contrast C of at least 0.5, as it can be seen in Figure 26 a range of approximately 4,500 ft can be achieved if the atmosphere is clear.",
        "The performance dramatically deteriorates, when the atmospheric conditions are problematic.",
        "As shown in Figure 27 a range of up to 1,500 ft is achievable, when using highly reflective CCR components.",
        "While our light source (3 million candlepower) was sufficient for a range of a few hundred feet, we remark that there exist commercially available light sources (20 million candlepower) or military (150 million candlepower [27]), powerful enough for ranges of a few thousand feet. 6 StarDust System Optimizations In this section we describe extensions of the proposed architecture that can constitute future research directions. 6.1 Chained Constraint Primitives In this paper we proposed four primitives for constraintbased relaxation algorithms: color, connectivity, time and space.",
        "To demonstrate the power that can be obtained by combining them, we proposed and evaluated one combination of such primitives: color and connectivity.",
        "An interesting research direction to pursue could be to chain more than two of these primitives.",
        "An example of such chain is: color, temporal, spatial and connectivity.",
        "Other research directions could be to use voting scheme for deciding which primitive to use or assign different weights to different relaxation algorithms. 69 6.2 Location Learning If after several iterations of the algorithm, none of the label probabilities for a node ni converges to a higher value, the confidence in our labeling of that node is relatively low.",
        "It would be interesting to associate with a node, more than one label (implicitly more than one location) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network (if the network was deployed for target tracking). 6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in extremely rugged environments.",
        "Canopies, dense vegetation, extremely obstructing environments pose significant challenges for sensor nodes localization.",
        "The hope, and our original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears under the canopy.",
        "By recording the last visible position of a sensor node (as seen from the aircraft) a reasonable estimate of the sensor node location can be obtained.",
        "This would require that sensor nodes posses self-righting capabilities, while in mid-air.",
        "Nevertheless, we remark on the suitability of our localization framework for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 7 Conclusions StarDust solves the localization problem for aerial deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required.",
        "Results show that accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within milliseconds.",
        "StarDust also shows robustness with respect to errors.",
        "We predict the influence the atmospheric conditions can have on the range of a system based on the StarDust framework, and show that hazy environments or daylight can pose significant challenges.",
        "Most importantly, the properties of StarDust support the potential for even more accurate localization solutions as well as solutions for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 8 References [1] T. He, S. Krishnamurthy, J.",

                "Corner-Cube Retroreflector (a) and an array of CCRs molded in plastic (b) esting property of this optical component is that an incoming beam of light is reflected back, towards the source of the light, irrespective of the angle of incidence.",
                "This is in contrast with a mirror, which needs to be precisely positioned to be perpendicular to the incident light.",
                "A very common and inexpensive implementation of an array of CCRs is the retroreflective plastic material used on cars and bicycles for night time detection, shown in Figure 1(b).",
                "In the StarDust system, each node is equipped with a small (e.g. 0.5in2) array of CCRs and the enclosure has self-righting capabilities that orient the array of CCRs predominantly upwards.",
                "It is critical to understand that the upward orientation does not need to be exact.",
                "Even when large angular variations from a perfectly upward orientation are present, a CCR will return the light in the exact same direction from which it came.",
                "In the remaining part of the section, we present the architecture of the StarDust system and the design of its main components. 3.1 System Architecture The envisioned sensor network localization scenario is as follows: • The sensor nodes are released, possibly in a controlled manner, from an aerial vehicle during the night. • The aerial vehicle hovers over the deployment area and uses a strobe light to illuminate it.",
                "The sensor nodes, equipped with CCRs and optical filters (acting as coloring devices) have self-righting capabilities and retroreflect the incoming strobe light.",
                "The retro-reflected light is either white, as the originating source light, or colored, due to optical filters. • The aerial vehicle records a sequence of two images very close in time (msec level).",
                "One image is taken when the strobe light is on, the other when the strobe light is off.",
                "The acquired images are used for obtaining the locations of sensor nodes (which appear as luminous spots in the image). • The aerial vehicle executes the mapping of node IDs to the identified locations in one of the following ways: a) by using the color of a retro-reflected light, if a sensor node has a unique color; b) by requiring sensor nodes to establish neighborhood information and report it to a base station; c) by controlling the time sequence of sensor nodes deployment and recording additional imLight Emitter Sensor Node i Transfer Function Φi(λ) Ψ(λ) Φ(Ψ(λ)) Image Processing Node ID Matching Radio Model R G(Λ,E) Central Device V V Figure 2.",
                "The StarDust system architecture ages; d) by controlling the location where a sensor node is deployed. • The computed locations are disseminated to the sensor network.",
                "The architecture of the StarDust system is shown in Figure 2.",
                "The architecture consists of two main components: the first is centralized and it is located on a more powerful device.",
                "The second is distributed and it resides on all sensor nodes.",
                "The Central Device consists of the following: the Light Emitter, the Image Processing module, the Node ID Mapping module and the Radio Model.",
                "The distributed component of the architecture is the Transfer Function, which acts as a filter for the incoming light.",
                "The aforementioned modules are briefly described below: • Light Emitter - It is a strobe light, capable of producing very intense, collimated light pulses.",
                "The emitted light is non-monochromatic (unlike a laser) and it is characterized by a spectral density Ψ(λ), a function of the wavelength.",
                "The emitted light is incident on the CCRs present on sensor nodes. • Transfer Function Φ(Ψ(λ)) - This is a bandpass filter for the incident light on the CCR.",
                "The filter allows a portion of the original spectrum, to be retro-reflected.",
                "From here on, we will refer to the transfer function as the color of a sensor node. • Image Processing - The Image Processing module acquires high resolution images.",
                "From these images the locations and the colors of sensor nodes are obtained.",
                "If only one set of pictures can be taken (i.e., one location of the light emitter/image analysis device), then the map of the field is assumed to be known as well as the distance between the imaging device and the field.",
                "The aforementioned assumptions (field map and distance to it) are not necessary if the images can be simultaneously taken from different locations.",
                "It is important to remark here that the identity of a node can not be directly obtained through Image Processing alone, unless a specific characteristic of a sensor node can be identified in the image. • Node ID Matching - This module uses the detected locations and through additional techniques (e.g., sensor node coloring and connectivity information (G(Λ,E)) from the deployed network) to uniquely identify the sensor nodes observed in the image.",
                "The connectivity information is represented by neighbor tables sent from 59 Algorithm 1 Image Processing 1: Background filtering 2: Retro-reflected light recognition through intensity filtering 3: Edge detection to obtain the location of sensor nodes 4: Color identification for each detected sensor node each sensor node to the Central Device. • Radio Model - This component provides an estimate of the radio range to the Node ID Matching module.",
                "It is only used by node ID matching techniques that are based on the radio connectivity in the network.",
                "The estimate of the radio range R is based on the sensor node density (obtained through the Image Processing module) and the connectivity information (i.e., G(Λ,E)).",
                "The two main components of the StarDust architecture are the Image Processing and the Node ID Mapping.",
                "Their design and analysis is presented in the sections that follow. 3.2 Image Processing The goal of the Image Processing Algorithm (IPA) is to identify the location of the nodes and their color.",
                "Note that IPA does not identify which node fell where, but only what is the set of locations where the nodes fell.",
                "IPA is executed after an aerial vehicle records two pictures: one in which the field of deployment is illuminated and one when no illuminations is present.",
                "Let Pdark be the picture of the deployment area, taken when no light was emitted and Plight be the picture of the same deployment area when a strong light beam was directed towards the sensor nodes.",
                "The proposed IPA has several steps, as shown in Algorithm 1.",
                "The first step is to obtain a third picture Pfilter where only the differences between Pdark and Plight remain.",
                "Let us assume that Pdark has a resolution of n × m, where n is the number of pixels in a row of the picture, while m is the number of pixels in a column of the picture.",
                "Then Pdark is composed of n × m pixels noted Pdark(i, j), i ∈ 1 ≤ i ≤ n,1 ≤ j ≤ m. Similarly Plight is composed of n × m pixels noted Plight(i, j), 1 ≤ i ≤ n,1 ≤ j ≤ m. Each pixel P is described by an RGB value where the R value is denoted by PR, the G value is denoted by PG, and the B value is denoted by PB.",
                "IPA then generates the third picture, Pfilter, through the following transformations: PR filter(i, j) = PR light(i, j)−PR dark(i, j) PG filter(i, j) = PG light(i, j)−PG dark(i, j) PB filter(i, j) = PB light(i, j)−PB dark(i, j) (1) After this transformation, all the features that appeared in both Pdark and Plight are removed from Pfilter.",
                "This simplifies the recognition of light retro-reflected by sensor nodes.",
                "The second step consists of identifying the elements contained in Pfilter that retro-reflect light.",
                "For this, an intensity filter is applied to Pfilter.",
                "First IPA converts Pfilter into a grayscale picture.",
                "Then the brightest pixels are identified and used to create Preflect.",
                "This step is eased by the fact that the reflecting nodes should appear much brighter than any other illuminated object in the picture.",
                "Support: Q(λk) ni P1 ... P2 ... PN λ1 ... λk ... λN Figure 3.",
                "Probabilistic label relaxation The third step runs an edge detection algorithm on Preflect to identify the boundary of the nodes present.",
                "A tool such as Matlab provides a number of edge detection techniques.",
                "We used the bwboundaries function.",
                "For the obtained edges, the location (x,y) (in the image) of each node is determined by computing the centroid of the points constituting its edges.",
                "Standard computer graphics techniques [23] are then used to transform the 2D locations of sensor nodes detected in multiple images into 3D sensor node locations.",
                "The color of the node is obtained as the color of the pixel located at (x,y) in Plight. 3.3 Node ID Matching The goal of the Node ID Matching module is to obtain the identity (node ID) of a luminous spot in the image, detected to be a sensor node.",
                "For this, we define V = {(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(xm,ym)} to be the set of locations of the sensor nodes, as detected by the Image Processing module and Λ = {λ1,λ2,...,λm} to be the set of unique node IDs assigned to the m sensor nodes, before deployment.",

                "We model the problem of finding the label λj of a node ni as a probabilistic label relaxation problem, frequently used in image processing/understanding.",
                "In the image processing domain, scene labeling (i.e., identifying objects in an image) plays a major role.",
                "The goal of scene labeling is to assign a label to each object detected in an image, such that an appropriate image interpretation is achieved.",
                "It is prohibitively expensive to consider the interactions among all the objects in an image.",
                "Instead, constraints placed among nearby objects generate local consistencies and through iteration, global consistencies can be obtained.",
                "The main idea of the sensor node localization through probabilistic label relaxation is to iteratively compute the probability of each label being the correct label for a sensor node, by taking into account, at each iteration, the support for a label.",
                "The support for a label can be understood as a hint or proof, that a particular label is more likely to be the correct one, when compared with the other potential labels for a sensor node.",
                "We pictorially depict this main idea in Figure 3.",
                "As shown, node ni has a set of candidate labels {λ1,...,λk}.",
                "Each of the labels has a different value for the Support function Q(λk).",
                "We defer the explanation of how the Support function is implemented until the subsections that follow, where we provide four concrete techniques.",
                "Formally, the algorithm is outlined in Algorithm 2, where the equations necessary for computing the new probability Pni(λk) for a label λk of a node ni, are expressed by the 60 Algorithm 2 Label Relaxation 1: for each sensor node ni do 2: assign equal prob. to all possible labels 3: end for 4: repeat 5: converged ← true 6: for each sensor node ni do 7: for each each label λj of ni do 8: compute the Support label λj: Equation 4 9: end for 10: compute K for the node ni: Equation 3 11: for each each label λj do 12: update probability of label λj: Equation 2 13: if |new prob.−old prob.| ≥ ε then 14: converged ← false 15: end if 16: end for 17: end for 18: until converged = true following equations: Ps+1 ni (λk) = 1 Kni Ps ni (λk)Qs ni (λk) (2) where Kni is a normalizing constant, given by: Kni = N ∑ k=1 Ps ni (λk)Qs ni (λk) (3) and Qs ni (λk) is: Qs ni (λk) = support for label λk of node ni (4) The label relaxation algorithm is iterative and it is polynomial in the size of the network(number of nodes).",
                "The pseudo-code is shown in Algorithm 2.",
                "It initializes the probabilities associated with each possible label, for a node ni, through a uniform distribution.",
                "At each iteration s, the algorithm updates the probability associated with each label, by considering the Support Qs ni (λk) for each candidate label of a sensor node.",
                "In the sections that follow, we describe four different techniques for implementing the Support function: based on node coloring, radio connectivity, the time of deployment (time) and the location of deployment (space).",
                "While some of these techniques are simplistic, they are primitives which, when combined, can create powerful localization systems.",
                "These design techniques have different trade-offs, which we will present in Section 3.3.6. 3.3.1 Relaxation with Color Constraints The unique mapping between a sensor nodes position (identified by the image processing) and a label can be obtained by assigning a unique color to each sensor node.",

                "The same trend of more accurate location information is evidenced by Figure 23 which shows that the percentage of nodes that are localized correctly grows quicker for the low connectivity deployment. 5.3 Localization Error vs.",
                "Image Processing Errors So far we investigated the sources for error in localization that are intrinsic to the Node ID Matching component.",
                "As previously presented, luminous objects can be mistakenly detected to be sensor nodes during the location detection phase of the Image Processing module.",
                "These false positives can be eliminated by the color recognition procedure of the Image Processing module.",
                "More problematic are false negatives (when a sensor node does not reflect back enough light to be detected).",

                "It is interesting to observe that the scenario when more colors are available (e.g., 12 colors) is being affected more drastically than the scenario with less colors (e.g., 4 colors).",
                "The benefit of having more colors available is still being maintained, at least for the range of colors we investigated (4 through 12 colors). 5.4 Localization Time In this section we look more closely at the duration for each of the four proposed relaxation techniques and two combinations of them: color-connectivity and color-time.",
                "We assume that 50 unique color filters can be manufactured, that the sensor network is deployed from 2,400 ft (necessary for the time-constrained relaxation) and that the time required for reporting connectivity grows linearly, with an initial reporting period of 160sec, as used in a real world tracking application [1].",
                "The localization duration results, as presented in Table 1, are depicted in Figure 25.",

                "We leave the investigation and rigorous classification of such technique combination for future work. 5.5 System Range In this section we evaluate the feasibility of the StarDust localization framework when considering the realities of light propagation through the atmosphere.",
                "The main factor that determines the range of our system is light scattering, which redirects the luminance of the source into the medium (in essence equally affecting the luminosity of the target and of the background).",
                "Scattering limits the visibility range by reducing the apparent contrast between the target and its background (approaches zero, as the distance increases).",
                "The apparent contrast Cr is quantitatively expressed by the formula: Cr = (Nt r −Nb r )/Nb r (10) where Nt r and Nb r are the apparent target radiance and apparent background radiance at distance r from the light source, respectively.",
                "The apparent radiance Nt r of a target at a distance r from the light source, is given by: Nt r = Na + Iρte−2σr πr2 (11) where I is the intensity of the light source, ρt is the target reflectance, σ is the spectral attenuation coefficient (≈ 0.12km−1 and ≈ 0.60km−1 for a clear and a hazy atmosphere, respectively) and Na is the radiance of the atmospheric backscatter, and it can be expressed as follows: Na = Gσ2I 2π 2σrZ 0.02σr e−x x2 dx (12) where G = 0.24 is a backscatter gain.",
                "The apparent background radiance Nb r is given by formulas similar with Equations 11 and 12, where only the target reflectance ρt is substituted with the background reflectance ρb.",
                "It is important to remark that when Cr reaches its lower limit, no increase in the source luminance or receiver sensitivity will increase the range of the system.",
                "From Equations 11 and 12 it can be observed that the parameter which can be controlled and can influence the range of the system is ρt, the target reflectance.",
                "Figures 26 and 27 depict the apparent contrast Cr as a function of the distance r for a clear and for a hazy atmosphere, respectively.",
                "The apparent contrast is investigated for reflectance coefficients ρt ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 (perfect reflector).",
                "For a contrast C of at least 0.5, as it can be seen in Figure 26 a range of approximately 4,500 ft can be achieved if the atmosphere is clear.",
                "The performance dramatically deteriorates, when the atmospheric conditions are problematic.",
                "As shown in Figure 27 a range of up to 1,500 ft is achievable, when using highly reflective CCR components.",
                "While our light source (3 million candlepower) was sufficient for a range of a few hundred feet, we remark that there exist commercially available light sources (20 million candlepower) or military (150 million candlepower [27]), powerful enough for ranges of a few thousand feet. 6 StarDust System Optimizations In this section we describe extensions of the proposed architecture that can constitute future research directions. 6.1 Chained Constraint Primitives In this paper we proposed four primitives for constraintbased relaxation algorithms: color, connectivity, time and space.",
                "To demonstrate the power that can be obtained by combining them, we proposed and evaluated one combination of such primitives: color and connectivity.",
                "An interesting research direction to pursue could be to chain more than two of these primitives.",
                "An example of such chain is: color, temporal, spatial and connectivity.",
                "Other research directions could be to use voting scheme for deciding which primitive to use or assign different weights to different relaxation algorithms. 69 6.2 Location Learning If after several iterations of the algorithm, none of the label probabilities for a node ni converges to a higher value, the confidence in our labeling of that node is relatively low.",
                "It would be interesting to associate with a node, more than one label (implicitly more than one location) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network (if the network was deployed for target tracking). 6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in extremely rugged environments.",
                "Canopies, dense vegetation, extremely obstructing environments pose significant challenges for sensor nodes localization.",
                "The hope, and our original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears under the canopy.",
                "By recording the last visible position of a sensor node (as seen from the aircraft) a reasonable estimate of the sensor node location can be obtained.",
                "This would require that sensor nodes posses self-righting capabilities, while in mid-air.",
                "Nevertheless, we remark on the suitability of our localization framework for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 7 Conclusions StarDust solves the localization problem for aerial deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required.",
                "Results show that accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within milliseconds.",
                "StarDust also shows robustness with respect to errors.",
                "We predict the influence the atmospheric conditions can have on the range of a system based on the StarDust framework, and show that hazy environments or daylight can pose significant challenges.",
                "Most importantly, the properties of StarDust support the potential for even more accurate localization solutions as well as solutions for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 8 References [1] T. He, S. Krishnamurthy, J.",

                "The main difficulty when applying the above ideas to the real world is the complexity of the hardware that needs to be put on a sensor node so that the emitted light can be detected from thousands of feet.",

                "Instead, what we propose to use for sensor node <br>localization</br> is a passive optical element called a retro-reflector.",

                "Corner-Cube Retroreflector (a) and an array of CCRs molded in plastic (b) esting property of this optical component is that an incoming beam of light is reflected back, towards the source of the light, irrespective of the angle of incidence.",
                "This is in contrast with a mirror, which needs to be precisely positioned to be perpendicular to the incident light.",
                "A very common and inexpensive implementation of an array of CCRs is the retroreflective plastic material used on cars and bicycles for night time detection, shown in Figure 1(b).",
                "In the StarDust system, each node is equipped with a small (e.g. 0.5in2) array of CCRs and the enclosure has self-righting capabilities that orient the array of CCRs predominantly upwards.",
                "It is critical to understand that the upward orientation does not need to be exact.",
                "Even when large angular variations from a perfectly upward orientation are present, a CCR will return the light in the exact same direction from which it came.",
                "In the remaining part of the section, we present the architecture of the StarDust system and the design of its main components. 3.1 System Architecture The envisioned sensor network <br>localization</br> scenario is as follows: • The sensor nodes are released, possibly in a controlled manner, from an aerial vehicle during the night. • The aerial vehicle hovers over the deployment area and uses a strobe light to illuminate it.",
                "The sensor nodes, equipped with CCRs and optical filters (acting as coloring devices) have self-righting capabilities and retroreflect the incoming strobe light.",
                "The retro-reflected light is either white, as the originating source light, or colored, due to optical filters. • The aerial vehicle records a sequence of two images very close in time (msec level).",
                "One image is taken when the strobe light is on, the other when the strobe light is off.",
                "The acquired images are used for obtaining the locations of sensor nodes (which appear as luminous spots in the image). • The aerial vehicle executes the mapping of node IDs to the identified locations in one of the following ways: a) by using the color of a retro-reflected light, if a sensor node has a unique color; b) by requiring sensor nodes to establish neighborhood information and report it to a base station; c) by controlling the time sequence of sensor nodes deployment and recording additional imLight Emitter Sensor Node i Transfer Function Φi(λ) Ψ(λ) Φ(Ψ(λ)) Image Processing Node ID Matching Radio Model R G(Λ,E) Central Device V V Figure 2.",
                "The StarDust system architecture ages; d) by controlling the location where a sensor node is deployed. • The computed locations are disseminated to the sensor network.",
                "The architecture of the StarDust system is shown in Figure 2.",
                "The architecture consists of two main components: the first is centralized and it is located on a more powerful device.",
                "The second is distributed and it resides on all sensor nodes.",
                "The Central Device consists of the following: the Light Emitter, the Image Processing module, the Node ID Mapping module and the Radio Model.",
                "The distributed component of the architecture is the Transfer Function, which acts as a filter for the incoming light.",
                "The aforementioned modules are briefly described below: • Light Emitter - It is a strobe light, capable of producing very intense, collimated light pulses.",
                "The emitted light is non-monochromatic (unlike a laser) and it is characterized by a spectral density Ψ(λ), a function of the wavelength.",
                "The emitted light is incident on the CCRs present on sensor nodes. • Transfer Function Φ(Ψ(λ)) - This is a bandpass filter for the incident light on the CCR.",
                "The filter allows a portion of the original spectrum, to be retro-reflected.",
                "From here on, we will refer to the transfer function as the color of a sensor node. • Image Processing - The Image Processing module acquires high resolution images.",
                "From these images the locations and the colors of sensor nodes are obtained.",
                "If only one set of pictures can be taken (i.e., one location of the light emitter/image analysis device), then the map of the field is assumed to be known as well as the distance between the imaging device and the field.",
                "The aforementioned assumptions (field map and distance to it) are not necessary if the images can be simultaneously taken from different locations.",
                "It is important to remark here that the identity of a node can not be directly obtained through Image Processing alone, unless a specific characteristic of a sensor node can be identified in the image. • Node ID Matching - This module uses the detected locations and through additional techniques (e.g., sensor node coloring and connectivity information (G(Λ,E)) from the deployed network) to uniquely identify the sensor nodes observed in the image.",
                "The connectivity information is represented by neighbor tables sent from 59 Algorithm 1 Image Processing 1: Background filtering 2: Retro-reflected light recognition through intensity filtering 3: Edge detection to obtain the location of sensor nodes 4: Color identification for each detected sensor node each sensor node to the Central Device. • Radio Model - This component provides an estimate of the radio range to the Node ID Matching module.",
                "It is only used by node ID matching techniques that are based on the radio connectivity in the network.",
                "The estimate of the radio range R is based on the sensor node density (obtained through the Image Processing module) and the connectivity information (i.e., G(Λ,E)).",
                "The two main components of the StarDust architecture are the Image Processing and the Node ID Mapping.",
                "Their design and analysis is presented in the sections that follow. 3.2 Image Processing The goal of the Image Processing Algorithm (IPA) is to identify the location of the nodes and their color.",
                "Note that IPA does not identify which node fell where, but only what is the set of locations where the nodes fell.",
                "IPA is executed after an aerial vehicle records two pictures: one in which the field of deployment is illuminated and one when no illuminations is present.",
                "Let Pdark be the picture of the deployment area, taken when no light was emitted and Plight be the picture of the same deployment area when a strong light beam was directed towards the sensor nodes.",
                "The proposed IPA has several steps, as shown in Algorithm 1.",
                "The first step is to obtain a third picture Pfilter where only the differences between Pdark and Plight remain.",
                "Let us assume that Pdark has a resolution of n × m, where n is the number of pixels in a row of the picture, while m is the number of pixels in a column of the picture.",
                "Then Pdark is composed of n × m pixels noted Pdark(i, j), i ∈ 1 ≤ i ≤ n,1 ≤ j ≤ m. Similarly Plight is composed of n × m pixels noted Plight(i, j), 1 ≤ i ≤ n,1 ≤ j ≤ m. Each pixel P is described by an RGB value where the R value is denoted by PR, the G value is denoted by PG, and the B value is denoted by PB.",
                "IPA then generates the third picture, Pfilter, through the following transformations: PR filter(i, j) = PR light(i, j)−PR dark(i, j) PG filter(i, j) = PG light(i, j)−PG dark(i, j) PB filter(i, j) = PB light(i, j)−PB dark(i, j) (1) After this transformation, all the features that appeared in both Pdark and Plight are removed from Pfilter.",
                "This simplifies the recognition of light retro-reflected by sensor nodes.",
                "The second step consists of identifying the elements contained in Pfilter that retro-reflect light.",
                "For this, an intensity filter is applied to Pfilter.",
                "First IPA converts Pfilter into a grayscale picture.",
                "Then the brightest pixels are identified and used to create Preflect.",
                "This step is eased by the fact that the reflecting nodes should appear much brighter than any other illuminated object in the picture.",
                "Support: Q(λk) ni P1 ... P2 ... PN λ1 ... λk ... λN Figure 3.",
                "Probabilistic label relaxation The third step runs an edge detection algorithm on Preflect to identify the boundary of the nodes present.",
                "A tool such as Matlab provides a number of edge detection techniques.",
                "We used the bwboundaries function.",
                "For the obtained edges, the location (x,y) (in the image) of each node is determined by computing the centroid of the points constituting its edges.",
                "Standard computer graphics techniques [23] are then used to transform the 2D locations of sensor nodes detected in multiple images into 3D sensor node locations.",
                "The color of the node is obtained as the color of the pixel located at (x,y) in Plight. 3.3 Node ID Matching The goal of the Node ID Matching module is to obtain the identity (node ID) of a luminous spot in the image, detected to be a sensor node.",
                "For this, we define V = {(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(xm,ym)} to be the set of locations of the sensor nodes, as detected by the Image Processing module and Λ = {λ1,λ2,...,λm} to be the set of unique node IDs assigned to the m sensor nodes, before deployment.",
                "From here on, we refer to node IDs as labels.",
                "We model the problem of finding the label λj of a node ni as a probabilistic label relaxation problem, frequently used in image processing/understanding.",
                "In the image processing domain, scene labeling (i.e., identifying objects in an image) plays a major role.",
                "The goal of scene labeling is to assign a label to each object detected in an image, such that an appropriate image interpretation is achieved.",
                "It is prohibitively expensive to consider the interactions among all the objects in an image.",
                "Instead, constraints placed among nearby objects generate local consistencies and through iteration, global consistencies can be obtained.",

                "It is critical to understand that the upward orientation does not need to be exact.",
                "Even when large angular variations from a perfectly upward orientation are present, a CCR will return the light in the exact same direction from which it came.",
                "In the remaining part of the section, we present the architecture of the StarDust system and the design of its main components. 3.1 System Architecture The envisioned sensor network localization scenario is as follows: • The sensor nodes are released, possibly in a controlled manner, from an aerial vehicle during the night. • The aerial vehicle hovers over the deployment area and uses a strobe light to illuminate it.",
                "The sensor nodes, equipped with CCRs and optical filters (acting as coloring devices) have self-righting capabilities and retroreflect the incoming strobe light.",

                "The StarDust system architecture ages; d) by controlling the location where a sensor node is deployed. • The computed locations are disseminated to the sensor network.",
                "The architecture of the StarDust system is shown in Figure 2.",
                "The architecture consists of two main components: the first is centralized and it is located on a more powerful device.",
                "The second is distributed and it resides on all sensor nodes.",
                "The Central Device consists of the following: the Light Emitter, the Image Processing module, the Node ID Mapping module and the Radio Model.",
                "The distributed component of the architecture is the Transfer Function, which acts as a filter for the incoming light.",
                "The aforementioned modules are briefly described below: • Light Emitter - It is a strobe light, capable of producing very intense, collimated light pulses.",
                "The emitted light is non-monochromatic (unlike a laser) and it is characterized by a spectral density Ψ(λ), a function of the wavelength.",
                "The emitted light is incident on the CCRs present on sensor nodes. • Transfer Function Φ(Ψ(λ)) - This is a bandpass filter for the incident light on the CCR.",
                "The filter allows a portion of the original spectrum, to be retro-reflected.",
                "From here on, we will refer to the transfer function as the color of a sensor node. • Image Processing - The Image Processing module acquires high resolution images.",
                "From these images the locations and the colors of sensor nodes are obtained.",
                "If only one set of pictures can be taken (i.e., one location of the light emitter/image analysis device), then the map of the field is assumed to be known as well as the distance between the imaging device and the field.",
                "The aforementioned assumptions (field map and distance to it) are not necessary if the images can be simultaneously taken from different locations.",
                "It is important to remark here that the identity of a node can not be directly obtained through Image Processing alone, unless a specific characteristic of a sensor node can be identified in the image. • Node ID Matching - This module uses the detected locations and through additional techniques (e.g., sensor node coloring and connectivity information (G(Λ,E)) from the deployed network) to uniquely identify the sensor nodes observed in the image.",
                "The connectivity information is represented by neighbor tables sent from 59 Algorithm 1 Image Processing 1: Background filtering 2: Retro-reflected light recognition through intensity filtering 3: Edge detection to obtain the location of sensor nodes 4: Color identification for each detected sensor node each sensor node to the Central Device. • Radio Model - This component provides an estimate of the radio range to the Node ID Matching module.",
                "It is only used by node ID matching techniques that are based on the radio connectivity in the network.",
                "The estimate of the radio range R is based on the sensor node density (obtained through the Image Processing module) and the connectivity information (i.e., G(Λ,E)).",
                "The two main components of the StarDust architecture are the Image Processing and the Node ID Mapping.",
                "Their design and analysis is presented in the sections that follow. 3.2 Image Processing The goal of the Image Processing Algorithm (IPA) is to identify the location of the nodes and their color.",
                "Note that IPA does not identify which node fell where, but only what is the set of locations where the nodes fell.",
                "IPA is executed after an aerial vehicle records two pictures: one in which the field of deployment is illuminated and one when no illuminations is present.",
                "Let Pdark be the picture of the deployment area, taken when no light was emitted and Plight be the picture of the same deployment area when a strong light beam was directed towards the sensor nodes.",
                "The proposed IPA has several steps, as shown in Algorithm 1.",
                "The first step is to obtain a third picture Pfilter where only the differences between Pdark and Plight remain.",
                "Let us assume that Pdark has a resolution of n × m, where n is the number of pixels in a row of the picture, while m is the number of pixels in a column of the picture.",
                "Then Pdark is composed of n × m pixels noted Pdark(i, j), i ∈ 1 ≤ i ≤ n,1 ≤ j ≤ m. Similarly Plight is composed of n × m pixels noted Plight(i, j), 1 ≤ i ≤ n,1 ≤ j ≤ m. Each pixel P is described by an RGB value where the R value is denoted by PR, the G value is denoted by PG, and the B value is denoted by PB.",
                "IPA then generates the third picture, Pfilter, through the following transformations: PR filter(i, j) = PR light(i, j)−PR dark(i, j) PG filter(i, j) = PG light(i, j)−PG dark(i, j) PB filter(i, j) = PB light(i, j)−PB dark(i, j) (1) After this transformation, all the features that appeared in both Pdark and Plight are removed from Pfilter.",
                "This simplifies the recognition of light retro-reflected by sensor nodes.",
                "The second step consists of identifying the elements contained in Pfilter that retro-reflect light.",
                "For this, an intensity filter is applied to Pfilter.",
                "First IPA converts Pfilter into a grayscale picture.",
                "Then the brightest pixels are identified and used to create Preflect.",
                "This step is eased by the fact that the reflecting nodes should appear much brighter than any other illuminated object in the picture.",
                "Support: Q(λk) ni P1 ... P2 ... PN λ1 ... λk ... λN Figure 3.",
                "Probabilistic label relaxation The third step runs an edge detection algorithm on Preflect to identify the boundary of the nodes present.",

                "The three major research questions that our evaluation tries to answer are: the feasibility of the proposed framework (can sensor nodes be optically detected at large distances), the localization accuracy of one actual implementation of the StarDust framework, and whether or not atmospheric conditions can affect the recognition of sensor nodes in an image.",
                "The first two questions are investigated by evaluating the two main components of the StarDust framework: the Image Processing and the Node ID Matching.",
                "These components have been evaluated separately mainly because of lack of adequate facilities.",
                "We wanted to evaluate the performance of the Image Processing Algorithm in a long range, realistic, experimental set-up, while the Node ID Matching required a relatively large area, available for long periods of time (for connectivity data gathering).",
                "The third research question is investigated through a computer modeling of atmospheric phenomena.",
                "For the evaluation of the Image Processing module, we performed experiments in a football stadium where we deploy 6 sensor nodes in a 3×2 grid.",
                "The distance between the Central device and the sensor nodes is approximately 500 ft.",
                "The metrics of interest are the number of false positives and false negatives in the Image Processing Algorithm.",

                "In order to investigate the influence the radio connectivity has on localization accuracy, we vary the height above ground of the deployed sensor nodes.",
                "Two set-ups are used: one in which the sensor nodes are on the ground, and the second one, in which the sensor nodes are raised 3 inches above ground.",
                "From here on, we will refer to these two experimental set-ups as the low connectivity and the high connectivity networks, respectively because when nodes are on the ground the communication range is low resulting in less neighbors than when the nodes are elevated and have a greater communication range.",
                "The metrics of interest are: the localization error (defined as the distance between the computed location and the true location - known from the manual placement), the percentage of nodes correctly localized, the convergence of the label relaxation algorithm, the time to localize and the robustness of the node ID mapping to errors in the Image Processing module.",
                "The parameters that we vary experimentally are: the angle under which images are taken, the focus of the camera, and the degree of connectivity.",
                "The parameters that we vary in simulations (subsequent to image acquisition and connectivity collection) the number of colors, the number of anchors, the number of false positives or negatives as input to the Node ID Matching component, the distance between the imaging device and sensor network (i.e., range), atmospheric conditions (light attenuation coefficient) and CCR reflectance (indicative of its quality). 5.1 Image Processing For the IPA evaluation, we deploy 6 sensor nodes in a 3 × 2 grid.",

                "In the remaining cases, we obtained a number of false positives of at most one, and a number of false negatives of at most two.",
                "We exclude two pairs of pictures from Figure 14.",
                "In the first excluded pair, we obtain 42 false positives and in the second pair 10 false positives and 7 false negatives.",
                "By carefully examining the pictures, we realized that the first pair was taken out of focus and that a car temporarily appeared in one of the pictures of the second pair.",
                "The anomaly in the second set was due to the fact that we waited too long to take the second picture.",
                "If the pictures had been taken a few milliseconds apart, the car would have been represented on either both or none of the pictures and the IPA would have filtered it out. 5.2 Node ID Matching We evaluate the Node ID Matching component of our system by collecting empirical data (connectivity information) from the outdoor deployment of 26 nodes in the 120×60 ft2 area.",

                "The main factor that determines the range of our system is light scattering, which redirects the luminance of the source into the medium (in essence equally affecting the luminosity of the target and of the background).",

                "The apparent background radiance Nb r is given by formulas similar with Equations 11 and 12, where only the target reflectance ρt is substituted with the background reflectance ρb.",
                "It is important to remark that when Cr reaches its lower limit, no increase in the source luminance or receiver sensitivity will increase the range of the system.",
                "From Equations 11 and 12 it can be observed that the parameter which can be controlled and can influence the range of the system is ρt, the target reflectance.",
                "Figures 26 and 27 depict the apparent contrast Cr as a function of the distance r for a clear and for a hazy atmosphere, respectively.",
                "The apparent contrast is investigated for reflectance coefficients ρt ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 (perfect reflector).",
                "For a contrast C of at least 0.5, as it can be seen in Figure 26 a range of approximately 4,500 ft can be achieved if the atmosphere is clear.",

                "Other research directions could be to use voting scheme for deciding which primitive to use or assign different weights to different relaxation algorithms. 69 6.2 Location Learning If after several iterations of the algorithm, none of the label probabilities for a node ni converges to a higher value, the confidence in our labeling of that node is relatively low.",
                "It would be interesting to associate with a node, more than one label (implicitly more than one location) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network (if the network was deployed for target tracking). 6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in extremely rugged environments.",
                "Canopies, dense vegetation, extremely obstructing environments pose significant challenges for sensor nodes localization.",
                "The hope, and our original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears under the canopy.",
                "By recording the last visible position of a sensor node (as seen from the aircraft) a reasonable estimate of the sensor node location can be obtained.",
                "This would require that sensor nodes posses self-righting capabilities, while in mid-air.",
                "Nevertheless, we remark on the suitability of our localization framework for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 7 Conclusions StarDust solves the localization problem for aerial deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required.",
                "Results show that accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within milliseconds.",
                "StarDust also shows robustness with respect to errors.",

                "The StarDust system architecture ages; d) by controlling the location where a sensor node is deployed. • The computed locations are disseminated to the sensor network.",
                "The architecture of the StarDust system is shown in Figure 2.",
                "The architecture consists of two main components: the first is centralized and it is located on a more powerful device.",
                "The second is distributed and it resides on all sensor nodes.",
                "The Central Device consists of the following: the Light Emitter, the Image Processing module, the Node ID Mapping module and the Radio Model.",
                "The distributed component of the architecture is the Transfer Function, which acts as a filter for the incoming light.",
                "The aforementioned modules are briefly described below: • Light Emitter - It is a strobe light, capable of producing very intense, collimated light pulses.",
                "The emitted light is non-monochromatic (unlike a laser) and it is characterized by a spectral density Ψ(λ), a function of the wavelength.",
                "The emitted light is incident on the CCRs present on sensor nodes. • Transfer Function Φ(Ψ(λ)) - This is a bandpass filter for the incident light on the CCR.",
                "The filter allows a portion of the original spectrum, to be retro-reflected.",
                "From here on, we will refer to the transfer function as the color of a sensor node. • Image Processing - The Image Processing module acquires high resolution images.",
                "From these images the locations and the colors of sensor nodes are obtained.",
                "If only one set of pictures can be taken (i.e., one location of the light emitter/image analysis device), then the map of the field is assumed to be known as well as the distance between the imaging device and the field.",
                "The aforementioned assumptions (field map and distance to it) are not necessary if the images can be simultaneously taken from different locations.",
                "It is important to remark here that the identity of a node can not be directly obtained through Image Processing alone, unless a specific characteristic of a sensor node can be identified in the image. • Node ID Matching - This module uses the detected locations and through additional techniques (e.g., sensor node coloring and connectivity information (G(Λ,E)) from the deployed network) to uniquely identify the sensor nodes observed in the image.",
                "The connectivity information is represented by neighbor tables sent from 59 Algorithm 1 Image Processing 1: Background filtering 2: Retro-reflected light recognition through intensity filtering 3: Edge detection to obtain the location of sensor nodes 4: Color identification for each detected sensor node each sensor node to the Central Device. • Radio Model - This component provides an estimate of the radio range to the Node ID Matching module.",
                "It is only used by node ID matching techniques that are based on the radio connectivity in the network.",
                "The estimate of the radio range R is based on the sensor node density (obtained through the Image Processing module) and the connectivity information (i.e., G(Λ,E)).",
                "The two main components of the StarDust architecture are the Image Processing and the Node ID Mapping.",
                "Their design and analysis is presented in the sections that follow. 3.2 Image Processing The goal of the Image Processing Algorithm (IPA) is to identify the location of the nodes and their color.",
                "Note that IPA does not identify which node fell where, but only what is the set of locations where the nodes fell.",
                "IPA is executed after an aerial vehicle records two pictures: one in which the field of deployment is illuminated and one when no illuminations is present.",
                "Let Pdark be the picture of the deployment area, taken when no light was emitted and Plight be the picture of the same deployment area when a strong light beam was directed towards the sensor nodes.",
                "The proposed IPA has several steps, as shown in Algorithm 1.",
                "The first step is to obtain a third picture Pfilter where only the differences between Pdark and Plight remain.",
                "Let us assume that Pdark has a resolution of n × m, where n is the number of pixels in a row of the picture, while m is the number of pixels in a column of the picture.",
                "Then Pdark is composed of n × m pixels noted Pdark(i, j), i ∈ 1 ≤ i ≤ n,1 ≤ j ≤ m. Similarly Plight is composed of n × m pixels noted Plight(i, j), 1 ≤ i ≤ n,1 ≤ j ≤ m. Each pixel P is described by an RGB value where the R value is denoted by PR, the G value is denoted by PG, and the B value is denoted by PB.",
                "IPA then generates the third picture, Pfilter, through the following transformations: PR filter(i, j) = PR light(i, j)−PR dark(i, j) PG filter(i, j) = PG light(i, j)−PG dark(i, j) PB filter(i, j) = PB light(i, j)−PB dark(i, j) (1) After this transformation, all the features that appeared in both Pdark and Plight are removed from Pfilter.",
                "This simplifies the recognition of light retro-reflected by sensor nodes.",
                "The second step consists of identifying the elements contained in Pfilter that retro-reflect light.",
                "For this, an intensity filter is applied to Pfilter.",
                "First IPA converts Pfilter into a grayscale picture.",
                "Then the brightest pixels are identified and used to create Preflect.",
                "This step is eased by the fact that the reflecting nodes should appear much brighter than any other illuminated object in the picture.",

                "It is important to remark that when Cr reaches its lower limit, no increase in the source luminance or receiver sensitivity will increase the range of the system.",
                "From Equations 11 and 12 it can be observed that the parameter which can be controlled and can influence the range of the system is ρt, the target reflectance.",

                "It would be interesting to associate with a node, more than one label (implicitly more than one location) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network (if the network was deployed for target tracking). 6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in extremely rugged environments.",
                "Canopies, dense vegetation, extremely obstructing environments pose significant challenges for sensor nodes localization.",

                "Nevertheless, we remark on the suitability of our localization framework for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 7 Conclusions StarDust solves the localization problem for aerial deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required.",
                "Results show that accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within milliseconds.",
                "StarDust also shows robustness with respect to errors.",

                "In the StarDust system, each node is equipped with a small (e.g. 0.5in2) array of CCRs and the enclosure has self-righting capabilities that orient the array of CCRs predominantly upwards.",
                "It is critical to understand that the upward orientation does not need to be exact.",
                "Even when large angular variations from a perfectly upward orientation are present, a CCR will return the light in the exact same direction from which it came.",
                "In the remaining part of the section, we present the architecture of the StarDust system and the design of its main components. 3.1 System Architecture The envisioned sensor network localization scenario is as follows: • The sensor nodes are released, possibly in a controlled manner, from an aerial vehicle during the night. • The aerial vehicle hovers over the deployment area and uses a strobe light to illuminate it.",
                "The sensor nodes, equipped with CCRs and optical filters (acting as coloring devices) have self-righting capabilities and retroreflect the incoming strobe light.",
                "The retro-reflected light is either white, as the originating source light, or colored, due to optical filters. • The aerial vehicle records a sequence of two images very close in time (msec level).",
                "One image is taken when the strobe light is on, the other when the strobe light is off.",
                "The acquired images are used for obtaining the locations of sensor nodes (which appear as luminous spots in the image). • The aerial vehicle executes the mapping of node IDs to the identified locations in one of the following ways: a) by using the color of a retro-reflected light, if a sensor node has a unique color; b) by requiring sensor nodes to establish neighborhood information and report it to a base station; c) by controlling the time sequence of sensor nodes deployment and recording additional imLight Emitter Sensor Node i Transfer Function Φi(λ) Ψ(λ) Φ(Ψ(λ)) Image Processing Node ID Matching Radio Model R G(Λ,E) Central Device V V Figure 2.",
                "The StarDust system architecture ages; d) by controlling the location where a sensor node is deployed. • The computed locations are disseminated to the sensor network.",
                "The architecture of the StarDust system is shown in Figure 2.",
                "The architecture consists of two main components: the first is centralized and it is located on a more powerful device.",
                "The second is distributed and it resides on all sensor nodes.",
                "The Central Device consists of the following: the Light Emitter, the Image Processing module, the Node ID Mapping module and the Radio Model.",
                "The distributed component of the architecture is the Transfer Function, which acts as a filter for the incoming light.",
                "The aforementioned modules are briefly described below: • Light Emitter - It is a strobe light, capable of producing very intense, collimated light pulses.",
                "The emitted light is non-monochromatic (unlike a laser) and it is characterized by a spectral density Ψ(λ), a function of the wavelength.",
                "The emitted light is incident on the CCRs present on sensor nodes. • Transfer Function Φ(Ψ(λ)) - This is a bandpass filter for the incident light on the CCR.",
                "The filter allows a portion of the original spectrum, to be retro-reflected.",
                "From here on, we will refer to the transfer function as the color of a sensor node. • Image Processing - The Image Processing module acquires high resolution images.",
                "From these images the locations and the colors of sensor nodes are obtained.",
                "If only one set of pictures can be taken (i.e., one location of the light emitter/image analysis device), then the map of the field is assumed to be known as well as the distance between the imaging device and the field.",
                "The aforementioned assumptions (field map and distance to it) are not necessary if the images can be simultaneously taken from different locations.",
                "It is important to remark here that the identity of a node can not be directly obtained through Image Processing alone, unless a specific characteristic of a sensor node can be identified in the image. • Node ID Matching - This module uses the detected locations and through additional techniques (e.g., sensor node coloring and connectivity information (G(Λ,E)) from the deployed network) to uniquely identify the sensor nodes observed in the image.",
                "The connectivity information is represented by neighbor tables sent from 59 Algorithm 1 Image Processing 1: Background filtering 2: Retro-reflected light recognition through intensity filtering 3: Edge detection to obtain the location of sensor nodes 4: Color identification for each detected sensor node each sensor node to the Central Device. • Radio Model - This component provides an estimate of the radio <br>range</br> to the Node ID Matching module.",
                "It is only used by node ID matching techniques that are based on the radio connectivity in the network.",
                "The estimate of the radio <br>range</br> R is based on the sensor node density (obtained through the Image Processing module) and the connectivity information (i.e., G(Λ,E)).",
                "The two main components of the StarDust architecture are the Image Processing and the Node ID Mapping.",
                "Their design and analysis is presented in the sections that follow. 3.2 Image Processing The goal of the Image Processing Algorithm (IPA) is to identify the location of the nodes and their color.",
                "Note that IPA does not identify which node fell where, but only what is the set of locations where the nodes fell.",

                "To demonstrate the power that can be obtained by combining them, we proposed and evaluated one combination of such primitives: color and connectivity.",
                "An interesting research direction to pursue could be to chain more than two of these primitives.",
                "An example of such chain is: color, temporal, spatial and connectivity.",
                "Other research directions could be to use voting scheme for deciding which primitive to use or assign different weights to different relaxation algorithms. 69 6.2 Location Learning If after several iterations of the algorithm, none of the label probabilities for a node ni converges to a higher value, the confidence in our labeling of that node is relatively low.",
                "It would be interesting to associate with a node, more than one label (implicitly more than one location) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network (if the network was deployed for target tracking). 6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in extremely rugged environments.",
                "Canopies, dense vegetation, extremely obstructing environments pose significant challenges for sensor nodes localization.",
                "The hope, and our original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears under the canopy.",
                "By recording the last visible position of a sensor node (as seen from the aircraft) a reasonable estimate of the sensor node location can be obtained.",
                "This would require that sensor nodes posses self-righting capabilities, while in mid-air.",
                "Nevertheless, we remark on the suitability of our localization framework for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 7 Conclusions StarDust solves the localization problem for aerial deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required.",
                "Results show that accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within milliseconds.",
                "StarDust also shows robustness with respect to errors.",
                "We predict the influence the atmospheric conditions can have on the <br>range</br> of a system based on the StarDust framework, and show that hazy environments or daylight can pose significant challenges.",

                "The main factor that determines the range of our system is light scattering, which redirects the luminance of the source into the medium (in essence equally affecting the luminosity of the target and of the background).",
                "Scattering limits the visibility range by reducing the apparent contrast between the target and its background (approaches zero, as the distance increases).",
                "The apparent contrast Cr is quantitatively expressed by the formula: Cr = (Nt r −Nb r )/Nb r (10) where Nt r and Nb r are the apparent target radiance and apparent background radiance at distance r from the light source, respectively.",
                "The apparent radiance Nt r of a target at a distance r from the light source, is given by: Nt r = Na + Iρte−2σr πr2 (11) where I is the intensity of the light source, ρt is the target reflectance, σ is the spectral attenuation coefficient (≈ 0.12km−1 and ≈ 0.60km−1 for a clear and a hazy atmosphere, respectively) and Na is the radiance of the atmospheric backscatter, and it can be expressed as follows: Na = Gσ2I 2π 2σrZ 0.02σr e−x x2 dx (12) where G = 0.24 is a backscatter gain.",
                "The apparent background radiance Nb r is given by formulas similar with Equations 11 and 12, where only the target reflectance ρt is substituted with the background reflectance ρb.",
                "It is important to remark that when Cr reaches its lower limit, no increase in the source luminance or receiver sensitivity will increase the range of the system.",
                "From Equations 11 and 12 it can be observed that the parameter which can be controlled and can influence the range of the system is ρt, the target reflectance.",
                "Figures 26 and 27 depict the apparent contrast Cr as a function of the distance r for a clear and for a hazy atmosphere, respectively.",
                "The apparent contrast is investigated for reflectance coefficients ρt ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 (perfect reflector).",
                "For a contrast C of at least 0.5, as it can be seen in Figure 26 a range of approximately 4,500 ft can be achieved if the atmosphere is clear.",
                "The performance dramatically deteriorates, when the atmospheric conditions are problematic.",
                "As shown in Figure 27 a range of up to 1,500 ft is achievable, when using highly reflective CCR components.",
                "While our light source (3 million candlepower) was sufficient for a range of a few hundred feet, we remark that there exist commercially available light sources (20 million candlepower) or military (150 million candlepower [27]), powerful enough for ranges of a few thousand feet. 6 StarDust System Optimizations In this section we describe extensions of the proposed architecture that can constitute future research directions. 6.1 Chained Constraint Primitives In this paper we proposed four primitives for constraintbased relaxation algorithms: color, connectivity, time and space.",
                "To demonstrate the power that can be obtained by combining them, we proposed and evaluated one combination of such primitives: color and connectivity.",
                "An interesting research direction to pursue could be to chain more than two of these primitives.",
                "An example of such chain is: color, temporal, spatial and connectivity.",
                "Other research directions could be to use voting scheme for deciding which primitive to use or assign different weights to different relaxation algorithms. 69 6.2 Location Learning If after several iterations of the algorithm, none of the label probabilities for a node ni converges to a higher value, the confidence in our labeling of that node is relatively low.",
                "It would be interesting to associate with a node, more than one label (implicitly more than one location) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network (if the network was deployed for target tracking). 6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the <br>sensor node</br> localization in extremely rugged environments.",
                "Canopies, dense vegetation, extremely obstructing environments pose significant challenges for sensor nodes localization.",
                "The hope, and our original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the <br>sensor node</br> disappears under the canopy.",
                "By recording the last visible position of a <br>sensor node</br> (as seen from the aircraft) a reasonable estimate of the <br>sensor node</br> location can be obtained.",
                "This would require that sensor nodes posses self-righting capabilities, while in mid-air.",
                "Nevertheless, we remark on the suitability of our localization framework for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 7 Conclusions StarDust solves the localization problem for aerial deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required.",
                "Results show that accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within milliseconds.",
                "StarDust also shows robustness with respect to errors.",
                "We predict the influence the atmospheric conditions can have on the range of a system based on the StarDust framework, and show that hazy environments or daylight can pose significant challenges.",
                "Most importantly, the properties of StarDust support the potential for even more accurate localization solutions as well as solutions for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 8 References [1] T. He, S. Krishnamurthy, J.",

                "While our light source (3 million candlepower) was sufficient for a range of a few hundred feet, we remark that there exist commercially available light sources (20 million candlepower) or military (150 million candlepower [27]), powerful enough for ranges of a few thousand feet. 6 StarDust System Optimizations In this section we describe extensions of the proposed architecture that can constitute future research directions. 6.1 Chained Constraint Primitives In this paper we proposed four primitives for constraintbased relaxation algorithms: color, connectivity, time and space.",
                "To demonstrate the power that can be obtained by combining them, we proposed and evaluated one combination of such primitives: color and connectivity.",
                "An interesting research direction to pursue could be to chain more than two of these primitives.",
                "An example of such chain is: color, temporal, spatial and connectivity.",
                "Other research directions could be to use voting scheme for deciding which primitive to use or assign different weights to different relaxation algorithms. 69 6.2 Location Learning If after several iterations of the algorithm, none of the label probabilities for a node ni converges to a higher value, the confidence in our labeling of that node is relatively low.",
                "It would be interesting to associate with a node, more than one label (implicitly more than one location) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network (if the network was deployed for target tracking). 6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in extremely rugged environments.",
                "Canopies, dense vegetation, extremely obstructing environments pose significant challenges for sensor nodes localization.",
                "The hope, and our original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears under the canopy.",
                "By recording the last visible position of a sensor node (as seen from the aircraft) a reasonable estimate of the sensor node location can be obtained.",
                "This would require that sensor nodes posses self-righting capabilities, while in mid-air.",
                "Nevertheless, we remark on the suitability of our localization framework for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 7 Conclusions StarDust solves the localization problem for aerial deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required.",
                "Results show that accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within milliseconds.",
                "StarDust also shows robustness with respect to errors.",
                "We predict the influence the atmospheric conditions can have on the range of a system based on the StarDust framework, and show that hazy environments or daylight can pose significant challenges.",
                "Most importantly, the properties of StarDust support the potential for even more accurate localization solutions as well as solutions for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 8 References [1] T. He, S. Krishnamurthy, J.",

                "From here on, we will refer to the transfer function as the color of a sensor node. • <br>image processing</br> - The <br>image processing</br> module acquires high resolution images.",
                "From these images the locations and the colors of sensor nodes are obtained.",

                "Scattering limits the visibility range by reducing the apparent contrast between the target and its background (approaches zero, as the distance increases).",
                "The apparent contrast Cr is quantitatively expressed by the formula: Cr = (Nt r −Nb r )/Nb r (10) where Nt r and Nb r are the apparent target radiance and apparent background radiance at distance r from the light source, respectively.",
                "The apparent radiance Nt r of a target at a distance r from the light source, is given by: Nt r = Na + Iρte−2σr πr2 (11) where I is the intensity of the light source, ρt is the target reflectance, σ is the spectral attenuation coefficient (≈ 0.12km−1 and ≈ 0.60km−1 for a clear and a hazy atmosphere, respectively) and Na is the radiance of the atmospheric backscatter, and it can be expressed as follows: Na = Gσ2I 2π 2σrZ 0.02σr e−x x2 dx (12) where G = 0.24 is a backscatter gain.",
                "The apparent background radiance Nb r is given by formulas similar with Equations 11 and 12, where only the target reflectance ρt is substituted with the background reflectance ρb.",
                "It is important to remark that when Cr reaches its lower limit, no increase in the source luminance or receiver sensitivity will increase the range of the system.",
                "From Equations 11 and 12 it can be observed that the parameter which can be controlled and can influence the range of the system is ρt, the target reflectance.",
                "Figures 26 and 27 depict the apparent contrast Cr as a function of the distance r for a clear and for a hazy atmosphere, respectively.",
                "The apparent contrast is investigated for reflectance coefficients ρt ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 (perfect reflector).",
                "For a contrast C of at least 0.5, as it can be seen in Figure 26 a range of approximately 4,500 ft can be achieved if the atmosphere is clear.",
                "The performance dramatically deteriorates, when the atmospheric conditions are problematic.",
                "As shown in Figure 27 a range of up to 1,500 ft is achievable, when using highly reflective CCR components.",
                "While our light source (3 million candlepower) was sufficient for a range of a few hundred feet, we remark that there exist commercially available light sources (20 million candlepower) or military (150 million candlepower [27]), powerful enough for ranges of a few thousand feet. 6 StarDust System Optimizations In this section we describe extensions of the proposed architecture that can constitute future research directions. 6.1 Chained Constraint Primitives In this paper we proposed four primitives for constraintbased relaxation algorithms: color, connectivity, time and space.",
                "To demonstrate the power that can be obtained by combining them, we proposed and evaluated one combination of such primitives: color and connectivity.",
                "An interesting research direction to pursue could be to chain more than two of these primitives.",
                "An example of such chain is: color, temporal, spatial and connectivity.",
                "Other research directions could be to use voting scheme for deciding which primitive to use or assign different weights to different relaxation algorithms. 69 6.2 Location Learning If after several iterations of the algorithm, none of the label probabilities for a node ni converges to a higher value, the confidence in our labeling of that node is relatively low.",
                "It would be interesting to associate with a node, more than one label (implicitly more than one location) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network (if the network was deployed for target tracking). 6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in extremely rugged environments.",
                "Canopies, dense vegetation, extremely obstructing environments pose significant challenges for sensor nodes localization.",
                "The hope, and our original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears under the canopy.",
                "By recording the last visible position of a sensor node (as seen from the aircraft) a reasonable estimate of the sensor node location can be obtained.",
                "This would require that sensor nodes posses self-righting capabilities, while in mid-air.",
                "Nevertheless, we remark on the suitability of our localization framework for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 7 Conclusions StarDust solves the localization problem for aerial deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required.",
                "Results show that accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within milliseconds.",
                "StarDust also shows robustness with respect to errors.",
                "We predict the influence the atmospheric conditions can have on the range of a system based on the StarDust framework, and show that hazy environments or daylight can pose significant challenges.",
                "Most importantly, the properties of StarDust support the potential for even more accurate localization solutions as well as solutions for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 8 References [1] T. He, S. Krishnamurthy, J.",

                "The main factor that determines the range of our system is light scattering, which redirects the luminance of the source into the medium (in essence equally affecting the luminosity of the target and of the background).",
                "Scattering limits the visibility range by reducing the apparent contrast between the target and its background (approaches zero, as the distance increases).",
                "The apparent contrast Cr is quantitatively expressed by the formula: Cr = (Nt r −Nb r )/Nb r (10) where Nt r and Nb r are the apparent target radiance and apparent background radiance at distance r from the light source, respectively.",
                "The apparent radiance Nt r of a target at a distance r from the light source, is given by: Nt r = Na + Iρte−2σr πr2 (11) where I is the intensity of the light source, ρt is the target reflectance, σ is the spectral attenuation coefficient (≈ 0.12km−1 and ≈ 0.60km−1 for a clear and a hazy atmosphere, respectively) and Na is the radiance of the atmospheric backscatter, and it can be expressed as follows: Na = Gσ2I 2π 2σrZ 0.02σr e−x x2 dx (12) where G = 0.24 is a backscatter gain.",
                "The apparent background radiance Nb r is given by formulas similar with Equations 11 and 12, where only the target reflectance ρt is substituted with the background reflectance ρb.",
                "It is important to remark that when Cr reaches its lower limit, no increase in the source luminance or receiver sensitivity will increase the range of the system.",
                "From Equations 11 and 12 it can be observed that the parameter which can be controlled and can influence the range of the system is ρt, the target reflectance.",
                "Figures 26 and 27 depict the apparent contrast Cr as a function of the distance r for a clear and for a hazy atmosphere, respectively.",
                "The apparent contrast is investigated for reflectance coefficients ρt ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 (perfect reflector).",
                "For a contrast C of at least 0.5, as it can be seen in Figure 26 a range of approximately 4,500 ft can be achieved if the atmosphere is clear.",
                "The performance dramatically deteriorates, when the atmospheric conditions are problematic.",
                "As shown in Figure 27 a range of up to 1,500 ft is achievable, when using highly reflective CCR components.",
                "While our light source (3 million candlepower) was sufficient for a range of a few hundred feet, we remark that there exist commercially available light sources (20 million candlepower) or military (150 million candlepower [27]), powerful enough for ranges of a few thousand feet. 6 StarDust System Optimizations In this section we describe extensions of the proposed architecture that can constitute future research directions. 6.1 Chained Constraint Primitives In this paper we proposed four primitives for constraintbased relaxation algorithms: color, connectivity, time and space.",
                "To demonstrate the power that can be obtained by combining them, we proposed and evaluated one combination of such primitives: color and connectivity.",
                "An interesting research direction to pursue could be to chain more than two of these primitives.",
                "An example of such chain is: color, temporal, spatial and connectivity.",
                "Other research directions could be to use voting scheme for deciding which primitive to use or assign different weights to different relaxation algorithms. 69 6.2 Location Learning If after several iterations of the algorithm, none of the label probabilities for a node ni converges to a higher value, the confidence in our labeling of that node is relatively low.",
                "It would be interesting to associate with a node, more than one label (implicitly more than one location) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network (if the network was deployed for target tracking). 6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in extremely rugged environments.",
                "Canopies, dense vegetation, extremely obstructing environments pose significant challenges for sensor nodes localization.",
                "The hope, and our original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears under the canopy.",
                "By recording the last visible position of a sensor node (as seen from the aircraft) a reasonable estimate of the sensor node location can be obtained.",
                "This would require that sensor nodes posses self-righting capabilities, while in mid-air.",
                "Nevertheless, we remark on the suitability of our localization framework for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 7 Conclusions StarDust solves the localization problem for aerial deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required.",
                "Results show that accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within milliseconds.",
                "StarDust also shows robustness with respect to errors.",
                "We predict the influence the atmospheric conditions can have on the range of a system based on the StarDust framework, and show that hazy environments or daylight can pose significant challenges.",
                "Most importantly, the properties of StarDust support the potential for even more accurate localization solutions as well as solutions for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 8 References [1] T. He, S. Krishnamurthy, J.",

                "Localization error vs. number of colors proves the localization accuracy quicker, from the additional number of colors available.",
                "When the number of colors becomes relatively large (twelve for our 26 sensor node network), both scenarios (low and high connectivity) have comparable localization errors, of less that 2 ft.",
                "The same trend of more accurate location information is evidenced by Figure 23 which shows that the percentage of nodes that are localized correctly grows quicker for the low connectivity deployment. 5.3 Localization Error vs.",
                "Image Processing Errors So far we investigated the sources for error in localization that are intrinsic to the Node ID Matching component.",

                "These false positives can be eliminated by the color recognition procedure of the Image Processing module.",
                "More problematic are false negatives (when a sensor node does not reflect back enough light to be detected).",

                "In this case, the localization algorithm is presented with two sets of nodes of different sizes, that need to be matched: one coming from the Image Processing (which misses some nodes) and one coming from the network, with the connectivity information (here we assume a fully connected network, so that all sensor nodes report their connectivity information).",
                "In this experiment we investigate how Image Processing errors (false negatives) influence the localization accuracy.",

                "The main factor that determines the range of our system is light scattering, which redirects the luminance of the source into the medium (in essence equally affecting the luminosity of the target and of the background).",
                "Scattering limits the visibility range by reducing the apparent contrast between the target and its background (approaches zero, as the distance increases).",
                "The apparent contrast Cr is quantitatively expressed by the formula: Cr = (Nt r −Nb r )/Nb r (10) where Nt r and Nb r are the apparent target radiance and apparent background radiance at distance r from the light source, respectively.",
                "The apparent radiance Nt r of a target at a distance r from the light source, is given by: Nt r = Na + Iρte−2σr πr2 (11) where I is the intensity of the light source, ρt is the target reflectance, σ is the spectral attenuation coefficient (≈ 0.12km−1 and ≈ 0.60km−1 for a clear and a hazy atmosphere, respectively) and Na is the radiance of the atmospheric backscatter, and it can be expressed as follows: Na = Gσ2I 2π 2σrZ 0.02σr e−x x2 dx (12) where G = 0.24 is a backscatter gain.",
                "The apparent background radiance Nb r is given by formulas similar with Equations 11 and 12, where only the target reflectance ρt is substituted with the background reflectance ρb.",
                "It is important to remark that when Cr reaches its lower limit, no increase in the source luminance or receiver sensitivity will increase the range of the system.",
                "From Equations 11 and 12 it can be observed that the parameter which can be controlled and can influence the range of the system is ρt, the target reflectance.",
                "Figures 26 and 27 depict the apparent contrast Cr as a function of the distance r for a clear and for a hazy atmosphere, respectively.",
                "The apparent contrast is investigated for reflectance coefficients ρt ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 (perfect reflector).",
                "For a contrast C of at least 0.5, as it can be seen in Figure 26 a range of approximately 4,500 ft can be achieved if the atmosphere is clear.",
                "The performance dramatically deteriorates, when the atmospheric conditions are problematic.",
                "As shown in Figure 27 a range of up to 1,500 ft is achievable, when using highly reflective CCR components.",
                "While our light source (3 million candlepower) was sufficient for a range of a few hundred feet, we remark that there exist commercially available light sources (20 million candlepower) or military (150 million candlepower [27]), powerful enough for ranges of a few thousand feet. 6 StarDust System Optimizations In this section we describe extensions of the proposed architecture that can constitute future research directions. 6.1 Chained Constraint Primitives In this paper we proposed four primitives for constraintbased relaxation algorithms: color, connectivity, time and space.",
                "To demonstrate the power that can be obtained by combining them, we proposed and evaluated one combination of such primitives: color and connectivity.",
                "An interesting research direction to pursue could be to chain more than two of these primitives.",
                "An example of such chain is: color, temporal, spatial and connectivity.",
                "Other research directions could be to use voting scheme for deciding which primitive to use or assign different weights to different relaxation algorithms. 69 6.2 Location Learning If after several iterations of the algorithm, none of the label probabilities for a node ni converges to a higher value, the confidence in our labeling of that node is relatively low.",
                "It would be interesting to associate with a node, more than one label (implicitly more than one location) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network (if the network was deployed for target tracking). 6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in extremely rugged environments.",
                "Canopies, dense vegetation, extremely obstructing environments pose significant challenges for sensor nodes localization.",
                "The hope, and our original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears under the canopy.",
                "By recording the last visible position of a sensor node (as seen from the aircraft) a reasonable estimate of the sensor node location can be obtained.",
                "This would require that sensor nodes posses self-righting capabilities, while in mid-air.",
                "Nevertheless, we remark on the suitability of our localization framework for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 7 Conclusions StarDust solves the localization problem for aerial deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required.",
                "Results show that accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within milliseconds.",
                "StarDust also shows robustness with respect to errors.",
                "We predict the influence the atmospheric conditions can have on the range of a system based on the StarDust framework, and show that hazy environments or daylight can pose significant challenges.",
                "Most importantly, the properties of StarDust support the potential for even more accurate localization solutions as well as solutions for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 8 References [1] T. He, S. Krishnamurthy, J.",

                "We leave the investigation and rigorous classification of such technique combination for future work. 5.5 System Range In this section we evaluate the feasibility of the StarDust localization framework when considering the realities of light propagation through the atmosphere.",
                "The main factor that determines the range of our system is light scattering, which redirects the luminance of the source into the medium (in essence equally affecting the luminosity of the target and of the background).",
                "Scattering limits the visibility range by reducing the apparent contrast between the target and its background (approaches zero, as the distance increases).",
                "The apparent contrast Cr is quantitatively expressed by the formula: Cr = (Nt r −Nb r )/Nb r (10) where Nt r and Nb r are the apparent target radiance and apparent background radiance at distance r from the light source, respectively.",
                "The apparent radiance Nt r of a target at a distance r from the light source, is given by: Nt r = Na + Iρte−2σr πr2 (11) where I is the intensity of the light source, ρt is the target reflectance, σ is the spectral attenuation coefficient (≈ 0.12km−1 and ≈ 0.60km−1 for a clear and a hazy atmosphere, respectively) and Na is the radiance of the atmospheric backscatter, and it can be expressed as follows: Na = Gσ2I 2π 2σrZ 0.02σr e−x x2 dx (12) where G = 0.24 is a backscatter gain.",
                "The apparent background radiance Nb r is given by formulas similar with Equations 11 and 12, where only the target reflectance ρt is substituted with the background reflectance ρb.",
                "It is important to remark that when Cr reaches its lower limit, no increase in the source luminance or receiver sensitivity will increase the range of the system.",
                "From Equations 11 and 12 it can be observed that the parameter which can be controlled and can influence the range of the system is ρt, the target reflectance.",
                "Figures 26 and 27 depict the apparent contrast Cr as a function of the distance r for a clear and for a hazy atmosphere, respectively.",
                "The apparent contrast is investigated for reflectance coefficients ρt ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 (perfect reflector).",
                "For a contrast C of at least 0.5, as it can be seen in Figure 26 a range of approximately 4,500 ft can be achieved if the atmosphere is clear.",
                "The performance dramatically deteriorates, when the atmospheric conditions are problematic.",
                "As shown in Figure 27 a range of up to 1,500 ft is achievable, when using highly reflective CCR components.",
                "While our light source (3 million candlepower) was sufficient for a range of a few hundred feet, we remark that there exist commercially available light sources (20 million candlepower) or military (150 million candlepower [27]), powerful enough for ranges of a few thousand feet. 6 StarDust System Optimizations In this section we describe extensions of the proposed architecture that can constitute future research directions. 6.1 Chained Constraint Primitives In this paper we proposed four primitives for constraintbased relaxation algorithms: color, connectivity, time and space.",
                "To demonstrate the power that can be obtained by combining them, we proposed and evaluated one combination of such primitives: color and connectivity.",
                "An interesting research direction to pursue could be to chain more than two of these primitives.",
                "An example of such chain is: color, temporal, spatial and connectivity.",
                "Other research directions could be to use voting scheme for deciding which primitive to use or assign different weights to different relaxation algorithms. 69 6.2 Location Learning If after several iterations of the algorithm, none of the label probabilities for a node ni converges to a higher value, the confidence in our labeling of that node is relatively low.",
                "It would be interesting to associate with a node, more than one label (implicitly more than one location) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network (if the network was deployed for target tracking). 6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in extremely rugged environments.",
                "Canopies, dense vegetation, extremely obstructing environments pose significant challenges for sensor nodes localization.",
                "The hope, and our original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears under the canopy.",
                "By recording the last visible position of a sensor node (as seen from the aircraft) a reasonable estimate of the sensor node location can be obtained.",
                "This would require that sensor nodes posses self-righting capabilities, while in mid-air.",
                "Nevertheless, we remark on the suitability of our localization framework for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 7 Conclusions StarDust solves the localization problem for aerial deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required.",
                "Results show that accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within milliseconds.",
                "StarDust also shows robustness with respect to errors.",
                "We predict the influence the atmospheric conditions can have on the range of a system based on the StarDust framework, and show that hazy environments or daylight can pose significant challenges.",
                "Most importantly, the properties of StarDust support the potential for even more accurate localization solutions as well as solutions for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 8 References [1] T. He, S. Krishnamurthy, J.",

                "If only one set of pictures can be taken (i.e., one location of the light emitter/image analysis device), then the map of the field is assumed to be known as well as the distance between the imaging device and the field.",

Each pixel P is described by an RGB value where the R value is denoted by PR, the G value is denoted by PG, and the B value is denoted by PB.",

                "This simplifies the recognition of light retro-reflected by sensor nodes.",
                "The second step consists of identifying the elements contained in Pfilter that retro-reflect light.",

                "The main factor that determines the range of our system is light scattering, which redirects the luminance of the source into the medium (in essence equally affecting the luminosity of the target and of the background).",
                "Scattering limits the visibility range by reducing the apparent contrast between the target and its background (approaches zero, as the distance increases).",
                "The apparent contrast Cr is quantitatively expressed by the formula: Cr = (Nt r −Nb r )/Nb r (10) where Nt r and Nb r are the apparent target radiance and apparent background radiance at distance r from the light source, respectively.",
                "The apparent radiance Nt r of a target at a distance r from the light source, is given by: Nt r = Na + Iρte−2σr πr2 (11) where I is the intensity of the light source, ρt is the target reflectance, σ is the spectral attenuation coefficient (≈ 0.12km−1 and ≈ 0.60km−1 for a clear and a hazy atmosphere, respectively) and Na is the radiance of the atmospheric backscatter, and it can be expressed as follows: Na = Gσ2I 2π 2σrZ 0.02σr e−x x2 dx (12) where G = 0.24 is a backscatter gain.",
                "The apparent background radiance Nb r is given by formulas similar with Equations 11 and 12, where only the target reflectance ρt is substituted with the background reflectance ρb.",
                "It is important to remark that when Cr reaches its lower limit, no increase in the source luminance or receiver sensitivity will increase the range of the system.",
                "From Equations 11 and 12 it can be observed that the parameter which can be controlled and can influence the range of the system is ρt, the target reflectance.",
                "Figures 26 and 27 depict the apparent contrast Cr as a function of the distance r for a clear and for a hazy atmosphere, respectively.",
                "The apparent contrast is investigated for reflectance coefficients ρt ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 (perfect reflector).",
                "For a contrast C of at least 0.5, as it can be seen in Figure 26 a range of approximately 4,500 ft can be achieved if the atmosphere is clear.",
                "The performance dramatically deteriorates, when the atmospheric conditions are problematic.",
                "As shown in Figure 27 a range of up to 1,500 ft is achievable, when using highly reflective CCR components.",
                "While our light source (3 million candlepower) was sufficient for a range of a few hundred feet, we remark that there exist commercially available light sources (20 million candlepower) or military (150 million candlepower [27]), powerful enough for ranges of a few thousand feet. 6 StarDust System Optimizations In this section we describe extensions of the proposed architecture that can constitute future research directions. 6.1 Chained Constraint Primitives In this paper we proposed four primitives for constraintbased relaxation algorithms: color, connectivity, time and space.",
                "To demonstrate the power that can be obtained by combining them, we proposed and evaluated one combination of such primitives: color and connectivity.",
                "An interesting research direction to pursue could be to chain more than two of these primitives.",
                "An example of such chain is: color, temporal, spatial and connectivity.",
                "Other research directions could be to use voting scheme for deciding which primitive to use or assign different weights to different relaxation algorithms. 69 6.2 Location Learning If after several iterations of the algorithm, none of the label probabilities for a node ni converges to a higher value, the confidence in our labeling of that node is relatively low.",
                "It would be interesting to associate with a node, more than one label (implicitly more than one location) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network (if the network was deployed for target tracking). 6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in extremely rugged environments.",
                "Canopies, dense vegetation, extremely obstructing environments pose significant challenges for sensor nodes localization.",
                "The hope, and our original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears under the canopy.",
                "By recording the last visible position of a sensor node (as seen from the aircraft) a reasonable estimate of the sensor node location can be obtained.",
                "This would require that sensor nodes posses self-righting capabilities, while in mid-air.",
                "Nevertheless, we remark on the suitability of our localization framework for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 7 Conclusions StarDust solves the localization problem for aerial deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required.",
                "Results show that accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within milliseconds.",
                "StarDust also shows robustness with respect to errors.",
                "We predict the influence the atmospheric conditions can have on the range of a system based on the StarDust framework, and show that hazy environments or daylight can pose significant challenges.",
                "Most importantly, the properties of StarDust support the potential for even more accurate localization solutions as well as solutions for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 8 References [1] T. He, S. Krishnamurthy, J.",

                "If only one set of pictures can be taken (i.e., one location of the light emitter/image analysis device), then the map of the field is assumed to be known as well as the distance between the imaging device and the field.",

Each pixel P is described by an RGB value where the R value is denoted by PR, the G value is denoted by PG, and the B value is denoted by PB.",
                "IPA then generates the third picture, Pfilter, through the following transformations: PR filter(i, j) = PR light(i, j)−PR dark(i, j) PG filter(i, j) = PG light(i, j)−PG dark(i, j) PB filter(i, j) = PB light(i, j)−PB dark(i, j) (1) After this transformation, all the features that appeared in both Pdark and Plight are removed from Pfilter.",
                "This simplifies the recognition of light retro-reflected by sensor nodes.",
                "The second step consists of identifying the elements contained in Pfilter that retro-reflect light.",
                "For this, an intensity filter is applied to Pfilter.",
                "First IPA converts Pfilter into a grayscale picture.",
                "Then the brightest pixels are identified and used to create Preflect.",

                "Each node can be identified, based on its unique color.",
                "This is the scenario for the relaxation with color constraints. • If |C| ≥ 1, there are several options for how to partition the coloring space.",

                "The apparent radiance Nt r of a target at a distance r from the light source, is given by: Nt r = Na + Iρte−2σr πr2 (11) where I is the intensity of the light source, ρt is the target reflectance, σ is the spectral attenuation coefficient (≈ 0.12km−1 and ≈ 0.60km−1 for a clear and a hazy atmosphere, respectively) and Na is the radiance of the atmospheric backscatter, and it can be expressed as follows: Na = Gσ2I 2π 2σrZ 0.02σr e−x x2 dx (12) where G = 0.24 is a backscatter gain.",
                "The apparent background radiance Nb r is given by formulas similar with Equations 11 and 12, where only the target reflectance ρt is substituted with the background reflectance ρb.",
                "It is important to remark that when Cr reaches its lower limit, no increase in the source luminance or receiver sensitivity will increase the range of the system.",
                "From Equations 11 and 12 it can be observed that the parameter which can be controlled and can influence the range of the system is ρt, the target reflectance.",
                "Figures 26 and 27 depict the apparent contrast Cr as a function of the distance r for a clear and for a hazy atmosphere, respectively.",
                "The apparent contrast is investigated for reflectance coefficients ρt ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 (perfect reflector).",
                "For a contrast C of at least 0.5, as it can be seen in Figure 26 a range of approximately 4,500 ft can be achieved if the atmosphere is clear.",

                "An example of such chain is: color, temporal, spatial and <br>connectivity</br>.",
                "Other research directions could be to use voting scheme for deciding which primitive to use or assign different weights to different relaxation algorithms. 69 6.2 Location Learning If after several iterations of the algorithm, none of the label probabilities for a node ni converges to a higher value, the confidence in our labeling of that node is relatively low.",
                "It would be interesting to associate with a node, more than one label (implicitly more than one location) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network (if the network was deployed for target tracking). 6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in extremely rugged environments.",
                "Canopies, dense vegetation, extremely obstructing environments pose significant challenges for sensor nodes localization.",
                "The hope, and our original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears under the canopy.",
                "By recording the last visible position of a sensor node (as seen from the aircraft) a reasonable estimate of the sensor node location can be obtained.",
                "This would require that sensor nodes posses self-righting capabilities, while in mid-air.",
                "Nevertheless, we remark on the suitability of our localization framework for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments. 7 Conclusions StarDust solves the localization problem for aerial deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required.",
                "Results show that accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within milliseconds.",
                "StarDust also shows robustness with respect to errors.",
                "We predict the influence the atmospheric conditions can have on the range of a system based on the StarDust framework, and show that hazy environments or daylight can pose significant challenges.",
