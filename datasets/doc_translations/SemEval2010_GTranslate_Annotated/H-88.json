Clarke School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, Canada claclark@plg.uwaterloo.ca ABSTRACT The direct application of standard ranking techniques to retrieve individual elements from a collection of XML documents often produces a result set in which the top ranks are dominated by a large number of elements taken from a small number of highly relevant documents. This paper presents and evaluates an algorithm that re-ranks this result set, with the aim of minimizing redundant content while preserving the benefits of element retrieval, including the benefit of identifying topic-focused components contained within relevant documents. The test collection developed by the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) forms the basis for the evaluation.

INTRODUCTION The representation of documents in XML provides an opportunity for information retrieval systems to take advantage of document structure, returning individual document components when appropriate, rather than complete documents in all circumstances. In response to a user query, an XML information retrieval system might return a mixture of paragraphs, sections, articles, bibliographic entries and other components. This facility is of particular benefit when a collection contains very long documents, such as product manuals or books, where the user should be directed to the most relevant portions of these documents. <article> <fm> <atl>Text Compression for Dynamic Document Databases</atl> <au>Alistair Moffat</au> <au>Justin Zobel</au> <au>Neil Sharman</au> <abs><p><b>Abstract</b> For ...</p></abs> </fm> <bdy> <sec><st>INTRODUCTION</st> <ip1>Modern document databases...</ip1> <p>There are good reasons to compress...</p> </sec> <sec><st>REDUCING MEMORY REQUIREMENTS</st>... <ss1><st>2.1 Method A</st>... </sec> ... </bdy> </article> Figure 1: A journal article encoded in XML. Figure 1 provides an example of a journal article encoded in XML, illustrating many of the important characteristics of XML documents. Tags indicate the beginning and end of each element, with elements varying widely in size, from one word to thousands of words. Some elements, such as paragraphs and sections, may be reasonably presented to the user as retrieval results, but others are not appropriate. Elements overlap each other - articles contain sections, sections contain subsections, and subsections contain paragraphs. Each of these characteristics affects the design of an XML IR system, and each leads to fundamental problems that must be solved in an successful system. Most of these fundamental problems can be solved through the careful adaptation of standard IR techniques, but the problems caused by overlap are unique to this area [4,11] and form the primary focus of this paper. The article of figure 1 may be viewed as an XML tree, as illustrated in figure 2. Formally, a collection of XML documents may be represented as a forest of ordered, rooted trees, consisting of a set of nodes N and a set of directed edges E connecting these nodes. For each node x ∈ N , the notation x.parent refers to the parent node of x, if one exists, and the notation x.children refers to the set of child nodes sec bdyfm atl au au au abs p b st ip1 sec st ss1 st article p Figure 2: Example XML tree. of x. Since an element may be represented by the node at its root, the output of an XML IR system may be viewed as a ranked list of the top-m nodes. The direct application of a standard relevance ranking technique to a set of XML elements can produce a result in which the top ranks are dominated by many structurally related elements. A high scoring section is likely to contain several high scoring paragraphs and to be contained in an high scoring article. For example, many of the elements in figure 2 would receive a high score on the keyword query text index compression algorithms. If each of these elements are presented to a user as an individual and separate result, she may waste considerable time reviewing and rejecting redundant content. One possible solution is to report only the highest scoring element along a given path in the tree, and to remove from the lower ranks any element containing it, or contained within it. Unfortunately, this approach destroys some of the possible benefits of XML IR. For example, an outer element may contain a substantial amount of information that does not appear in an inner element, but the inner element may be heavily focused on the query topic and provide a short overview of the key concepts. In such cases, it is reasonable to report elements which contain, or are contained in, higher ranking elements. Even when an entire book is relevant, a user may still wish to have the most important paragraphs highlighted, to guide her reading and to save time [6]. This paper presents a method for controlling overlap. Starting with an initial element ranking, a re-ranking algorithm adjusts the scores of lower ranking elements that contain, or are contained within, higher ranking elements, reflecting the fact that this information may now be redundant. For example, once an element representing a section appears in the ranking, the scores for the paragraphs it contains and the article that contains it are reduced. The inspiration for this strategy comes partially from recent work on structured documents retrieval, where terms appearing in different fields, such as the title and body, are given different weights [20]. Extending that approach, the re-ranking algorithm varies weights dynamically as elements are processed. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: After a discussion of background work and evaluation methodology, a baseline retrieval method is presented in section 4. This baseline method represents a reasonable adaptation of standard IR technology to XML. Section 5 then outlines a strategy for controlling overlap, using the baseline method as a starting point. A re-ranking algorithm implementing this strategy is presented in section 6 and evaluated in section 7. Section 8 discusses an extended version of the algorithm. 2. BACKGROUND This section provides a general overview of XML information retrieval and discusses related work, with an emphasis on the fundamental problems mentioned in the introduction. Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1]. Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language. We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need. Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document. Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages. When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16]. In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole. If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article. It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results. This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10]. For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself. Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user. An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18]. Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8]. INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself. Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas. The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX. Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning. While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved. Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics. Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3. INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology. For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002. Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example. At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics. The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used. For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection. For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned. For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy. Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description. In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants. Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own XML IR system. Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient. Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic. A four-point scale is used in both dimensions. Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant. Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values. One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others. This variant is essentially the familiar MAP value, with (3,3) elements treated as relevant and all other elements treated as not relevant. Other quantization functions are designed to give partial credit to elements which are near misses, due to a lack or exhaustivity and/or specificity. Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function placing greater emphasis on specificity. This paper reports results of this metric using all three of these quantization functions. Since this metric was first introduced at INEX 2002, it is generally referred as the inex-2002 metric. The inex-2002 metric does not penalize overlap. In particular, both the generalized and sog quantization functions give partial credit to a near miss even when a (3,3) element overlapping it is reported at a higher rank. To address this problem, Kazai et al. [11] propose an XML cumulated gain metric, which compares the cumulated gain [9] of a ranked list to an ideal gain vector. This ideal gain vector is constructed from the relevance judgments by eliminating overlap and retaining only best element along a given path. Thus, the XCG metric rewards retrieval runs that avoid overlap. While XCG was not used officially at INEX 2004, a version of it is likely to be used in the future. At INEX 2003, yet another metric was introduced to ameliorate the perceived limitations of the inex-2002 metric. This inex-2003 metric extends the definitions of precision and recall to consider both the size of reported components and the overlap between them. Two versions were created, one that considered only component size and another that considered both size and overlap. While the inex-2003 metric exhibits undesirable anomalies [11], and was not used in 2004, values are reported in the evaluation section to provide an additional instrument for investigating overlap. 4. BASELINE RETRIEVAL METHOD This section provides an overview of baseline XML information retrieval method currently used in the MultiText IR system, developed by the Information Retrieval Group at the University of Waterloo [3]. This retrieval method results from the adaptation and tuning of the Okapi BM25 measure [21] to the XML information retrieval task. The MultiText system performed respectably at INEX 2004, placing in the top ten under all of the quantization functions, and placing first when the quantization function emphasized exhaustivity. To support retrieval from XML and other structured document types, the system provides generalized queries of the form: rank X by Y where X is a sub-query specifying a set of document elements to be ranked and Y is a vector of sub-queries specifying individual retrieval terms. For our INEX 2004 runs, the sub-query X specified a list of retrievable elements as those with tag names as follows: abs app article bb bdy bm fig fm ip1 li p sec ss1 ss2 vt This list includes bibliographic entries (bb) and figure captions (fig) as well as paragraphs, sections and subsections. Prior to INEX 2004, the INEX collection and the INEX 2003 relevance judgments were manually analyzed to select these tag names. Tag names were selected on the basis of their frequency in the collection, the average size of their associated elements, and the relative number of positive relevance judgments they received. Automating this selection process is planned as future work. For INEX 2004, the term vector Y was derived from the topic by splitting phrases into individual words, eliminating stopwords and negative terms (those starting with -), and applying a stemmer. For example, keyword field of topic 166 +tree edit distance + XML -image became the four-term query $tree $edit $distance $xml where the $ operator within a quoted string stems the term that follows it. Our implementation of Okapi BM25 is derived from the formula of Robertson et al. [21] by setting parameters k2 = 0 and k3 = ∞. Given a term set Q, an element x is assigned the score   t∈Q w(1) qt (k1 + 1)xt K + xt (1) where w(1) = log ¡ D − Dt + 0.5 Dt + 0.5 ¢ D = number of documents in the corpus Dt = number of documents containing t qt = frequency that t occurs in the topic xt = frequency that t occurs in x K = k1((1 − b) + b · lx/lavg) lx = length of x lavg = average document length 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 0.15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 MeanAveragePrecision(inex-2002) k1 strict generalized sog Figure 3: Impact of k1 on inex-2002 mean average precision with b = 0.75 (INEX 2003 CO topics). Prior to INEX 2004, the INEX 2003 topics and judgments were used to tune the b and k1 parameters, and the impact of this tuning is discussed later in this section. For the purposes of computing document-level statistics (D, Dt and lavg) a document is defined to be an article. These statistics are used for ranking all element types. Following the suggestion of Kamps et al. [10], the retrieval results are filtered to eliminate very short elements, those less than 25 words in length. The use of article statistics for all element types might be questioned. This approach may be justified by viewing the collection as a set of articles to be searched using standard document-oriented techniques, where only articles may be returned. The score computed for an element is essentially the score it would receive if it were added to the collection as a new document, ignoring the minor adjustments needed to the document-level statistics. Nonetheless, we plan to examine this issue again in the future. In our experience, the performance of BM25 typically benefits from tuning the b and k1 parameters to the collection, whenever training queries are available for this purpose. Prior to INEX 2004, we trained the MultiText system using the INEX 2003 queries. As a starting point we used the values b = 0.75 and k1 = 1.2, which perform well on TREC adhoc collections and are used as default values in our system. The results were surprising. Figure 3 shows the result of varying k1 with b = 0.75 on the MAP values under three quantization functions. In our experience, optimal values for k1 are typically in the range 0.0 to 2.0. In this case, large values are required for good performance. Between k1 = 1.0 and k1 = 6.0 MAP increases by over 15% under the strict quantization. Similar improvements are seen under the generalized and sog quantizations. In contrast, our default value of b = 0.75 works well under all quantization functions (figure 4). After tuning over a wide range of values under several quantization functions, we selected values of k = 10.0 and b = 0.80 for our INEX 2004 experiments, and these values are used for the experiments reported in section 7. 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 0.15 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 MeanAveragePrecision(inex-2002) b strict generalized sog Figure 4: Impact of b on inex-2002 mean average precision with k1 = 10 (INEX 2003 CO topics). 5. CONTROLLING OVERLAP Starting with an element ranking generated by the baseline method described in the previous section, elements are re-ranked to control overlap by iteratively adjusting the scores of those elements containing or contained in higher ranking elements. At a conceptual level, re-ranking proceeds as follows: 1. Report the highest ranking element. 2. Adjust the scores of the unreported elements. 3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until m elements are reported. One approach to adjusting the scores of unreported elements in step 2 might be based on the Okapi BM25 scores of the involved elements. For example, assume a paragraph with score p is reported in step 1. In step 2, the section containing the paragraph might then have its score s lowered by an amount α · p to reflect the reduced contribution the paragraph should make to the sections score. In a related context, Robertson et al. [20] argue strongly against the linear combination of Okapi scores in this fashion. That work considers the problem of assigning different weights to different document fields, such as the title and body associated with Web pages. A common approach to this problem scores the title and body separately and generates a final score as a linear combination of the two. Robertson et al. discuss the theoretical flaws in this approach and demonstrate experimentally that it can actually harm retrieval effectiveness. Instead, they apply the weights at the term frequency level, with an occurrence of a query term t in the title making a greater contribution to the score than an occurrence in the body. In equation 1, xt becomes α0 · yt + α1 · zt, where yt is the number of times t occurs in the title and zt is the number of times t occurs in the body. Translating this approach to our context, the contribution of terms appearing in elements is dynamically reduced as they are reported. The next section presents and analysis a simple re-ranking algorithm that follows this strategy. The algorithm is evaluated experimentally in section 7. One limitation of the algorithm is that the contribution of terms appearing in reported elements is reduced by the same factor regardless of the number of reported elements in which it appears. In section 8 the algorithm is extended to apply increasing weights, lowering the score, when a term appears in more than one reported element. 6. RE-RANKING ALGORITHM The re-ranking algorithm operates over XML trees, such as the one appearing in figure 2. Input to the algorithm is a list of n elements ranked according to their initial BM25 scores. During the initial ranking the XML tree is dynamically re-constructed to include only those nodes with nonzero BM25 scores, so n may be considerably less than |N |. Output from the algorithm is a list of the top m elements, ranked according to their adjusted scores. An element is represented by the node x ∈ N at its root. Associated with this node are fields storing the length of element, term frequencies, and other information required by the re-ranking algorithm, as follows: x.f - term frequency vector x.g - term frequency adjustments x.l - element length x.score - current Okapi BM25 score x.reported - boolean flag, initially false x.children - set of child nodes x.parent - parent node, if one exists These fields are populated during the initial ranking process, and updated as the algorithm progresses. The vector x.f contains term frequency information corresponding to each term in the query. The vector x.g is initially zero and is updated by the algorithm as elements are reported. The score field contains the current BM25 score for the element, which will change as the values in x.g change. The score is computed using equation 1, with the xt value for each term determined by a combination of the values in x.f and x.g. Given a term t ∈ Q, let ft be the component of x.f corresponding to t, and let gt be the component of x.g corresponding to t, then: xt = ft − α · gt (2) For processing by the re-ranking algorithm, nodes are stored in priority queues, ordered by decreasing score. Each priority queue PQ supports three operations: PQ.front() - returns the node with greatest score PQ.add (x) - adds node x to the queue PQ.remove(x) - removes node x from the queue When implemented using standard data structures, the front operation requires O(1) time, and the other operations require O(log n) time, where n is the size of the queue. The core of the re-ranking algorithm is presented in figure 5. The algorithm takes as input the priority queue S containing the initial ranking, and produces the top-m reranked nodes in the priority queue F. After initializing F to be empty on line 1, the algorithm loops m times over lines 215, transferring at least one node from S to F during each iteration. At the start of each iteration, the unreported node at the front of S has the greatest adjusted score, and it is removed and added to F. The algorithm then traverses the 1 F ← ∅ 2 for i ← 1 to m do 3 x ← S.front() 4 S.remove(x) 5 x.reported ← true 6 F.add(x) 7 8 foreach y ∈ x.children do 9 Down (y) 10 end do 11 12 if x is not a root node then 13 Up (x, x.parent) 14 end if 15 end do Figure 5: Re-Ranking Algorithm - As input, the algorithm takes a priority queue S, containing XML nodes ranked by their initial scores, and returns its results in priority queue F, ranked by adjusted scores. 1 Up(x, y) ≡ 2 S.remove(y) 3 y.g ← y.g + x.f − x.g 4 recompute y.score 5 S.add(y) 6 if y is not a root node then 7 Up (x, y.parent) 8 end if 9 10 Down(x) ≡ 11 if not x.reported then 12 S.remove(x) 14 x.g ← x.f 15 recompute x.score 16 if x.score > 0 then 17 F.add(x) 18 end if 19 x.reported ← true 20 foreach y ∈ x.children do 21 Down (y) 22 end do 23 end if Figure 6: Tree traversal routines called by the reranking algorithm. 0.0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 0.25 0.26 0.27 0.28 0.29 0.30 0.31 0.32 0.33 0.34 0.35 0.36 MeanAveragePrecision(inex-2002) XMLCumulatedGain(XCG) alpha MAP (strict) MAP (generalized) MAP (sog) XCG (sog2) Figure 7: Impact of α on XCG and inex-2002 MAP (INEX 2004 CO topics; assessment set I). nodes ancestors (lines 8-10) and descendants (lines 12-14) adjusting the scores of these nodes. The tree traversal routines, Up and Down are given in figure 6. The Up routine removes each ancestor node from S, adjusts its term frequency values, recomputes its score, and adds it back into S. The adjustment of the term frequency values (line 3) adds to y.g only the previously unreported term occurrences in x. Re-computation of the score on line 4 uses equations 1 and 2. The Down routine performs a similar operation on each descendant. However, since the contents of each descendant are entirely contained in a reported element its final score may be computed, and it is removed from S and added to F. In order to determine the time complexity of the algorithm, first note that a node may be an argument to Down at most once. Thereafter, the reported flag of its parent is true. During each call to Down a node may be moved from S to F, requiring O(log n) time. Thus, the total time for all calls to Down is O(n log n), and we may temporarily ignore lines 8-10 of figure 5 when considering the time complexity of the loop over lines 2-15. During each iteration of this loop, a node and each of its ancestors are removed from a priority queue and then added back into a priority queue. Since a node may have at most h ancestors, where h is the maximum height of any tree in the collection, each of the m iterations requires O(h log n) time. Combining these observations produces an overall time complexity of O((n + mh) log n). In practice, re-ranking an INEX result set requires less than 200ms on a three-year-old desktop PC. 7. EVALUATION None of the metrics described in section 3.3 is a close fit with the view of overlap advocated by this paper. Nonetheless, when taken together they provide insight into the behaviour of the re-ranking algorithm. The INEX evaluation packages (inex_eval and inex_eval_ng) were used to compute values for the inex-2002 and inex-2003 metrics. Values for the XCG metrics were computed using software supplied by its inventors [11]. Figure 7 plots the three variants of inex-2002 MAP metric together with the XCG metric. Values for these metrics 0.0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 0.20 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 MeanAveragePrecision(inex-2003) alpha strict, overlap not considered strict, overlap considered generalized, overlap not considered generalized, overlap considered Figure 8: Impact of α on inex-2003 MAP (INEX 2004 CO topics; assessment set I). are plotted for values of α between 0.0 and 1.0. Recalling that the XCG metric is designed to penalize overlap, while the inex-2002 metric ignores overlap, the conflict between the metrics is obvious. The MAP values at one extreme (α = 0.0) and the XCG value at the other extreme (α = 1.0) represent retrieval performance comparable to the best systems at INEX 2004 [8,12]. Figure 8 plots values of the inex-2003 MAP metric for two quantizations, with and without consideration of overlap. Once again, conflict is apparent, with the influence of α substantially lessened when overlap is considered. 8. EXTENDED ALGORITHM One limitation of the re-ranking algorithm is that a single weight α is used to adjust the scores of both the ancestors and descendants of reported elements. An obvious extension is to use different weights in these two cases. Furthermore, the same weight is used regardless of the number of times an element is contained in a reported element. For example, a paragraph may form part of a reported section and then form part of a reported article. Since the user may now have seen this paragraph twice, its score should be further lowered by increasing the value of the weight. Motivated by these observations, the re-ranking algorithm may be extended with a series of weights 1 = β0 ≥ β1 ≥ β2 ≥ ... ≥ βM ≥ 0. where βj is the weight applied to a node that has been a descendant of a reported node j times. Note that an upper bound on M is h, the maximum height of any XML tree in the collection. However, in practice M is likely to be relatively small (perhaps 3 or 4). Figure 9 presents replacements for the Up and Down routines of figure 6, incorporating this series of weights. One extra field is required in each node, as follows: x.j - down count The value of x.j is initially set to zero in all nodes and is incremented each time Down is called with x as its argument. When computing the score of node, the value of x.j selects 1 Up(x, y) ≡ 2 if not y.reported then 3 S.remove(y) 4 y.g ← y.g + x.f − x.g 5 recompute y.score 6 S.add(y) 8 if y is not a root node then 9 Up (x, y.parent) 10 end if 11 end if 12 13 Down(x) ≡ 14 if x.j < M then 15 x.j ← x.j + 1 16 if not x.reported then 17 S.remove(x) 18 recompute x.score 19 S.add(x) 20 end if 21 foreach y ∈ x.children do 22 Down (y) 23 end do 24 end if Figure 9: Extended tree traversal routines. the weight to be applied to the node by adjusting the value of xt in equation 1, as follows: xt = βx.j · (ft − α · gt) (3) where ft and gt are the components of x.f and x.g corresponding to term t. A few additional changes are required to extend Up and Down. The Up routine returns immediately (line 2) if its argument has already been reported, since term frequencies have already been adjusted in its ancestors. The Down routine does not report its argument, but instead recomputes its score and adds it back into S. A node cannot be an argument to Down more than M +1 times, which in turn implies an overall time complexity of O((nM + mh) log n). Since M ≤ h and m ≤ n, the time complexity is also O(nh log n). 9. CONCLUDING DISCUSSION When generating retrieval results over an XML collection, some overlap in the results should be tolerated, and may be beneficial. For example, when a highly exhaustive and fairly specific (3,2) element contains a much smaller (2,3) element, both should be reported to the user, and retrieval algorithms and evaluation metrics should respect this relationship. The algorithm presented in this paper controls overlap by weighting the terms occurring in reported elements to reflect their reduced importance. Other approaches may also help to control overlap. For example, when XML retrieval results are presented to users it may be desirable to cluster structurally related elements together, visually illustrating the relationships between them. While this style of user interface may help a user cope with overlap, the strategy presented in this paper continues to be applicable, by determining the best elements to include in each cluster. At Waterloo, we continue to develop and test our ideas for INEX 2005. In particular, we are investigating methods for learning the α and βj weights. We are also re-evaluating our approach to document statistics and examining appropriate adjustments to the k1 parameter as term weights change [20]. 10.

Clarke Escuela de Ciencias de la Computación, Universidad de Waterloo, Canadá claclark@plg.uwaterloo.ca Resumen La aplicación directa de las técnicas de clasificación estándar para recuperar elementos individuales de una colección de documentos XML a menudo produce un resultado que produce un resultado produce un resultado.establecido en el que los rangos superiores están dominados por una gran cantidad de elementos tomados de un pequeño número de documentos altamente relevantes. Este documento presenta y evalúa un algoritmo que vuelve a rangar este conjunto de resultados, con el objetivo de minimizar el contenido redundante al tiempo que preserva los beneficios de la recuperación de elementos, incluido el beneficio de identificar componentes centrados en el tema contenidos en documentos relevantes. La recopilación de pruebas desarrollada por la iniciativa para la evaluación de la recuperación de XML (INEX) forma la base de la evaluación. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos H.3.3 [Sistemas de información]: Algoritmos de Búsqueda y recuperación de información de almacenamiento de información y recuperación de términos generales, medición, rendimiento, experimentación 1. Introducción La representación de documentos en XML brinda la oportunidad de que los sistemas de recuperación de información aprovechen la estructura del documento, que devuelve los componentes de documentos individuales cuando sea apropiado, en lugar de documentos completos en todas las circunstancias. En respuesta a una consulta de usuario, un sistema de recuperación de información XML podría devolver una mezcla de párrafos, secciones, artículos, entradas bibliográficas y otros componentes. Esta instalación es de particular beneficio cuando una colección contiene documentos muy largos, como manuales o libros de productos, donde el usuario debe dirigirse a las partes más relevantes de estos documentos.<artículo> <fm> <tl> Compresión de texto para bases de datos de documentos dinámicos </ttl> <au> Alistair Moffat </au> <au> Justin Zobel </au> <au> Neil Sharman </au> <ens> <ens> <ens>P> <b> Abstract </b> para ... </p> </sbs> </fm> <bdy> <sec> <st> Introducción </st> <p1> bases de datos de documentos modernos ... </ip1> <p> Hay buenas razones para comprimir ... </p> </ec> <ec> <s> Reducción de los requisitos de memoria </st> ... <ss1> <st> 2.1 Método A <//ST> ... </ec> ... </bdy> </artículo> Figura 1: Un artículo de revista codificado en XML. La Figura 1 proporciona un ejemplo de un artículo de revista codificado en XML, que ilustra muchas de las características importantes de los documentos XML. Las etiquetas indican el principio y el final de cada elemento, con elementos que varían ampliamente en tamaño, de una palabra a miles de palabras. Algunos elementos, como párrafos y secciones, pueden presentarse razonablemente al usuario como resultados de recuperación, pero otros no son apropiados. Los elementos se superponen entre sí: los artículos contienen secciones, las secciones contienen subsecciones y las subsecciones contienen párrafos. Cada una de estas características afecta el diseño de un sistema IR XML, y cada uno conduce a problemas fundamentales que deben resolverse en un sistema exitoso. La mayoría de estos problemas fundamentales se pueden resolver a través de la cuidadosa adaptación de las técnicas IR estándar, pero los problemas causados por la superposición son exclusivos de esta área [4,11] y forman el enfoque principal de este documento. El artículo de la Figura 1 puede verse como un árbol XML, como se ilustra en la Figura 2. Formalmente, una colección de documentos XML puede representarse como un bosque de árboles ordenados y enraizados, que consiste en un conjunto de nodos N y un conjunto de bordes E dirigidos que conecta estos nodos. Para cada nodo x ∈ N, la notación X.Parent se refiere al nodo principal de X, si existe, y la notación X. Los niños se refieren al conjunto de nodos infantiles Sec Bdyfm Atl Au Au ABS P B ST IP1 SEC ST SS1ST Artículo P Figura 2: Ejemplo de árbol XML.de x. Dado que un elemento puede estar representado por el nodo en su raíz, la salida de un sistema IR XML puede verse como una lista clasificada de los nodos TOP-M. La aplicación directa de una técnica de clasificación de relevancia estándar para un conjunto de elementos XML puede producir un resultado en el que los rangos superiores están dominados por muchos elementos estructuralmente relacionados. Es probable que una sección de alta puntuación contenga varios párrafos de alta puntuación y sea contenida en un artículo de alta puntuación. Por ejemplo, muchos de los elementos en la Figura 2 recibirían una puntuación alta en los algoritmos de compresión del índice de texto de consulta clave. Si cada uno de estos elementos se presenta a un usuario como un resultado individual y separado, puede perder un tiempo considerable revisando y rechazando contenido redundante. Una posible solución es informar solo el elemento de puntuación más alto a lo largo de una ruta determinada en el árbol, y eliminar de los rangos inferiores cualquier elemento que lo contenga, o contenido dentro de él. Desafortunadamente, este enfoque destruye algunos de los posibles beneficios de XML IR. Por ejemplo, un elemento exterior puede contener una cantidad sustancial de información que no aparece en un elemento interno, pero el elemento interno puede estar muy enfocado en el tema de la consulta y proporcionar una breve descripción de los conceptos clave. En tales casos, es razonable informar elementos que contienen o están contenidos en elementos de clasificación más altos. Incluso cuando un libro completo es relevante, un usuario aún puede desear que se resalten los párrafos más importantes, para guiar su lectura y ahorrar tiempo [6]. Este artículo presenta un método para controlar la superposición. Comenzando con una clasificación de elementos iniciales, un algoritmo de reanicación ajusta los puntajes de elementos de clasificación más bajos que contienen, o están contenidos, elementos de clasificación más altos, lo que refleja el hecho de que esta información ahora puede ser redundante. Por ejemplo, una vez que aparece un elemento que representa una sección en la clasificación, los puntajes para los párrafos que contiene y el artículo que lo contiene se reduce. La inspiración para esta estrategia proviene en parte del trabajo reciente en la recuperación de documentos estructurados, donde los términos que aparecen en diferentes campos, como el título y el cuerpo, tienen diferentes pesos [20]. Al extender ese enfoque, el algoritmo de reanimiento varía los pesos dinámicamente a medida que se procesan elementos. El resto del documento se organiza de la siguiente manera: después de una discusión sobre el trabajo de antecedentes y la metodología de evaluación, se presenta un método de recuperación de línea de base en la Sección 4. Este método de referencia representa una adaptación razonable de la tecnología IR estándar a XML. La Sección 5 describe una estrategia para controlar la superposición, utilizando el método de referencia como punto de partida. En la Sección 6 se presenta un algoritmo de reanupación que implementa esta estrategia y se evalúa en la Sección 7. La Sección 8 discute una versión extendida del algoritmo.2. Antecedentes Esta sección proporciona una descripción general de la recuperación de información XML y analiza el trabajo relacionado, con énfasis en los problemas fundamentales mencionados en la introducción. Mucha investigación en el área de la recuperación de XML lo ve desde una perspectiva de base de datos tradicional, que se ocupa de problemas como la implementación de lenguajes de consulta estructurados [5] y el procesamiento de las uniones [1]. Aquí, tomamos un perceptivo IR orientado al contenido, centrándonos en documentos XML que contienen principalmente datos y consultas del lenguaje natural que se expresan principalmente en el lenguaje natural. Suponemos que estas consultas indican solo la naturaleza del contenido deseado, no su estructura, y que el papel del sistema IR es determinar qué elementos satisfacen mejor la información subyacente. Otra investigación IR ha considerado consultas mixtas, en las que se especifican tanto el contenido como los requisitos estructurales [2,6,14,17,23].2.1 Estadísticas de término y documento en aplicaciones de recuperación de información tradicional La unidad de recuperación estándar se considera el documento. Dependiendo de la aplicación, este término podría interpretarse para abarcar muchos objetos diferentes, incluidas páginas web, artículos periodísticos y mensajes de correo electrónico. Al aplicar técnicas de clasificación de relevancia estándar en el contexto de XML IR, un enfoque natural es tratar cada elemento como un documento separado, con estadísticas de término disponibles para cada uno [16]. Además, la mayoría de las técnicas de clasificación requieren estadísticas globales (por ejemplo, frecuencia inversa de documentos) calculadas sobre la colección en su conjunto. Si consideramos que esta colección incluye todos los elementos que podrían ser devueltos por el sistema, una ocurrencia específica de un término puede aparecer en varios documentos diferentes, tal vez en elementos que representan un párrafo, una subsección, una sección y un artículo. No es apropiado calcular la frecuencia del documento inverso bajo el supuesto de que el término está contenido en todos estos elementos, ya que el número de elementos que contienen un término depende completamente de la disposición estructural de los documentos [13,23].2.2 Elementos recuperables Si bien un sistema IR XML podría recuperar cualquier elemento, muchos elementos pueden no ser apropiados como resultados de recuperación. Este suele ser el caso en que los elementos contienen muy poco texto [10]. Por ejemplo, un título de sección que contiene solo los términos de consulta puede recibir una puntuación alta de un algoritmo de clasificación, pero solo sería de valor limitado para un usuario, que podría preferir la sección real en sí. Otros elementos pueden reflejar la estructura física, en lugar de lógica, física, que puede tener poco o ningún significado para un usuario. Un sistema IR XML efectivo debe devolver solo aquellos elementos que tienen suficiente contenido para ser utilizables y pueden estar solo como objetos independientes [15,18]. Los componentes estándar de documentos, como párrafos, secciones, subsecciones y resúmenes, generalmente cumplen con estos requisitos;Los títulos, frases en cursiva y campos de metadatos individuales a menudo no.2.3 Metodología de evaluación En los últimos tres años, la iniciativa para la evaluación de la recuperación de XML (INEX) ha alentado la investigación sobre la tecnología de recuperación de información XML [7,8]. INEX es una serie de conferencias experimentales, similar a TREC, con grupos de diferentes instituciones que completan una o más tareas experimentales utilizando sus propias herramientas y sistemas, y comparando sus resultados en la conferencia misma. Más de 50 grupos participaron en INEX 2004, y la conferencia se ha vuelto tan influyente en el área de XML IR como TREC está en otras áreas IR. La investigación descrita en este documento, así como en gran parte del trabajo relacionado que cita, depende de las colecciones de prueba desarrolladas por INEX. La superposición causa problemas considerables con la evaluación de la recuperación, y los organizadores e participantes de INEX han luchado con estos problemas desde el principio. Si bien se han logrado un progreso sustancial, estos problemas aún no están completamente resueltos. Kazai et al.[11] proporcionan una exposición detallada del problema de superposición en el contexto de la evaluación de recuperación de INEX y discuten las métricas de evaluación actuales y propuestas. Muchas de estas métricas se aplican para evaluar los experimentos informados en este documento, y se describen brevemente en la siguiente sección.3. Las limitaciones de espacio de INEX 2004 impiden la inclusión de más de un breve resumen de las tareas de INEX 2004 y la metodología de evaluación. Para obtener información detallada, se deben consultar los procedimientos de la conferencia en sí [8].3.1 Tareas para las principales tareas experimentales, los participantes de INEX 2004 recibieron una colección de 12,107 artículos tomados de las revistas y revistas de las Sociedades de Computación IEEE entre 1995 y 2002. Cada documento está codificado en XML utilizando un DTD común, con el documento de las Figuras 1 y 2 que proporciona un ejemplo. En INEX 2004, las dos tareas experimentales principales fueron las tareas de recuperación ADHOC, investigando el rendimiento de los sistemas que buscan una colección estática utilizando temas previamente invisibles. Las dos tareas diferían en los tipos de temas que usaron. Para una tarea, la tarea de solo contenido o CO, los temas consisten en declaraciones cortas de lenguaje natural sin referencia directa a la estructura de los documentos en la colección. Para esta tarea, se requiere el sistema IR para seleccionar los elementos que se devolverán. Para la otra tarea, la tarea de contenido y estructura o CAS, los temas se escriben en un lenguaje de consulta XML [22] y contienen referencias explícitas a la estructura de documentos, que el sistema IR debe intentar satisfacer. Dado que el trabajo descrito en este documento se dirige a la tarea de solo contenido, donde el sistema IR no recibe orientación sobre los elementos para devolver, la tarea CAS se ignora en el resto de nuestra descripción. En 2004, los organizadores de la conferencia seleccionaron 40 nuevos temas de CO de las contribuciones proporcionadas por los participantes de la conferencia. Cada tema incluye una consulta de palabras clave breve, que es ejecutada sobre la colección por cada grupo participante en su propio sistema XML IR. Cada grupo podría presentar hasta tres carreras experimentales que consisten en los elementos M = 1500 superiores para cada tema.3.2 Evaluación de relevancia Dado que XML IR se refiere a la ubicación de los elementos que proporcionan una cobertura completa de un tema al tiempo que contiene la menor cantidad de información extraña posible, los juicios simples relevantes versus no relevantes no son suficientes. En cambio, los organizadores de INEX adoptaron dos dimensiones para una evaluación de relevancia: la dimensión de agotamiento refleja el grado en que un elemento cubre el tema, y la dimensión de especificidad refleja el grado en que un elemento se centra en el tema. Se usa una escala de cuatro puntos en ambas dimensiones. Por lo tanto, un elemento (3,3) es altamente exhaustivo y altamente específico, un elemento (1,3) es marginalmente exhaustivo y altamente específico, y un elemento (0,0) no es relevante. Se puede encontrar información adicional sobre la metodología de evaluación en Piwowarski y Lalmas [19], quienes proporcionan una justificación detallada.3.3 Métricas de evaluación La métrica de evaluación principal utilizada en INEX 2004 es una versión de precisión promedio media (MAP), ajustada por varias funciones de cuantización para dar diferentes pesos a diferentes elementos, dependiendo de sus valores de agotamiento y especificidad. Una variante, la función de cuantización estricta da un peso de 1 a (3,3) elementos y un peso de 0 a todos los demás. Esta variante es esencialmente el valor de mapa familiar, con (3,3) elementos tratados como relevantes y todos los demás elementos tratados como no relevantes. Otras funciones de cuantificación están diseñadas para dar crédito parcial a los elementos que están cerca de las fallas, debido a la falta o agotación y/o especificidad. Tanto la función de cuantización generalizada como los elementos de crédito de la función de generalización orientada a la especificidad (SOG) de acuerdo con su grado de relevancia [11], con la segunda función poniendo mayor énfasis en la especificidad. Este documento informa los resultados de esta métrica utilizando las tres funciones de cuantización. Dado que esta métrica se introdujo por primera vez en INEX 2002, generalmente se conoce como la métrica INEX-2002. La métrica INEX-2002 no penaliza la superposición. En particular, tanto las funciones de cuantización generalizada como la SOG dan crédito parcial a una fallas cercanas incluso cuando un elemento (3,3) que se superpone a él se informa en un rango más alto. Para abordar este problema, Kazai et al.[11] propone una métrica de ganancia acumulada por XML, que compara la ganancia acumulada [9] de una lista clasificada con un vector de ganancia ideal. Este vector de ganancia ideal se construye a partir de los juicios de relevancia al eliminar la superposición y retener solo el mejor elemento a lo largo de una ruta determinada. Por lo tanto, la recuperación de la métrica XCG corre que evitan la superposición. Si bien XCG no se usó oficialmente en INEX 2004, es probable que se use una versión en el futuro. En INEX 2003, se introdujo otra métrica para mejorar las limitaciones percibidas de la métrica INEX-2002. Esta métrica INEX-2003 extiende las definiciones de precisión y recuerdo para considerar tanto el tamaño de los componentes informados como la superposición entre ellos. Se crearon dos versiones, una que consideró solo el tamaño del componente y otra que consideró tanto el tamaño como la superposición. Si bien la métrica INEX-2003 exhibe anomalías indeseables [11], y no se usó en 2004, los valores se informan en la sección de evaluación para proporcionar un instrumento adicional para investigar la superposición.4. Método de recuperación de línea de base Esta sección proporciona una descripción general del método de recuperación de información XML de línea de base que se utiliza actualmente en el sistema IR multitexio, desarrollado por el grupo de recuperación de información en la Universidad de Waterloo [3]. Este método de recuperación resulta de la adaptación y ajuste de la medida Okapi BM25 [21] a la tarea de recuperación de información XML. El sistema MultiText se desempeñó respetablemente en INEX 2004, colocando en los diez primeros en todas las funciones de cuantización y colocando primero cuando la función de cuantización enfatizó la agotación. Para admitir la recuperación de XML y otros tipos de documentos estructurados, el sistema proporciona consultas generalizadas de la forma: Rango X por y donde X es un subcreidor que especifica un conjunto de elementos de documentos que se clasificarán y Y es un vector de subcreperias especificandoTérminos de recuperación individuales. Para nuestras ejecuciones de INEX 2004, el Sub-Query X especificó una lista de elementos recuperables como aquellos con nombres de etiquetas de la siguiente manera: Artículo de la aplicación ABS BB BDY BM Fig FM IP1 Li P Sec SS1 SS2 VT Esta lista incluye entradas bibliográficas (BB) y figurasubtítulos (Fig), así como párrafos, secciones y subsecciones. Antes de INEX 2004, la colección INEX y los juicios de relevancia de INEX 2003 se analizaron manualmente para seleccionar estos nombres de etiquetas. Los nombres de las etiquetas se seleccionaron sobre la base de su frecuencia en la colección, el tamaño promedio de sus elementos asociados y el número relativo de juicios de relevancia positiva que recibieron. La automatización de este proceso de selección se planifica como un trabajo futuro. Para INEX 2004, el término vector Y se derivó del tema dividiendo frases en palabras individuales, eliminando las palabras de parada y los términos negativos (aquellos que comienzan con -) y aplicando un Stemmer. Por ejemplo, el campo de palabras clave del tema 166 + Distancia de edición de árbol + XML -Image se convirtió en la consulta de cuatro términos $ Tree $ Edit $ Distancia $ XML donde el operador $ dentro de una cadena citada detiene el término que lo sigue. Nuestra implementación de Okapi BM25 se deriva de la fórmula de Robertson et al.[21] estableciendo parámetros k2 = 0 y k3 = ∞. Dado un conjunto de términos Q, se le asigna a un elemento x la puntuación t∈Q w (1) Qt (k1 + 1) xt k + xt (1) donde w (1) = log ¡d - dt + 0.5 dt + 0.5 ¢D = número de documentos en el corpus dt = número de documentos que contienen t qt = frecuencia que t ocurre en el tema xt = frecuencia que t ocurre en x k = k1 ((1 - b) + b · lx/lavg) lx =Longitud de x LAVG = Promedio del documento Longitud 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 0.15 0 2 4 6 6 8 10 12 14 Media MediaB = 0.75 (temas de CO INEX 2003). Antes de INEX 2004, los temas y juicios de INEX 2003 se utilizaron para sintonizar los parámetros B y K1, y el impacto de esta sintonización se discute más adelante en esta sección. A los fines de calcular estadísticas a nivel de documento (D, DT y LAV), se define un documento como un artículo. Estas estadísticas se utilizan para clasificar todos los tipos de elementos. Después de la sugerencia de Kamps et al.[10], los resultados de la recuperación se filtran para eliminar elementos muy cortos, aquellos de menos de 25 palabras de longitud. El uso de estadísticas de artículo para todos los tipos de elementos podría ser cuestionado. Este enfoque puede justificarse al ver la colección como un conjunto de artículos que se buscarán utilizando técnicas estándar orientadas a documentos, donde solo se pueden devolver artículos. El puntaje calculado para un elemento es esencialmente el puntaje que recibiría si se agregara a la colección como un nuevo documento, ignorando los ajustes menores necesarios para las estadísticas a nivel de documento. No obstante, planeamos examinar este problema nuevamente en el futuro. En nuestra experiencia, el rendimiento de BM25 generalmente se beneficia de ajustar los parámetros B y K1 a la colección, siempre que las consultas de capacitación estén disponibles para este propósito. Antes de INEX 2004, capacitamos al sistema multitext utilizando las consultas INEX 2003. Como punto de partida, utilizamos los valores B = 0.75 y K1 = 1.2, que funcionan bien en las colecciones TREC ADHOC y se utilizan como valores predeterminados en nuestro sistema. Los resultados fueron sorprendentes. La Figura 3 muestra el resultado de K1 variable con B = 0.75 en los valores del MAP en tres funciones de cuantización. En nuestra experiencia, los valores óptimos para K1 se encuentran típicamente en el rango de 0.0 a 2.0. En este caso, se requieren grandes valores para un buen rendimiento. Entre K1 = 1.0 y K1 = 6.0, el mapa aumenta en más del 15% bajo la cuantificación estricta. Se observan mejoras similares bajo las cuantizaciones generalizadas y SOG. En contraste, nuestro valor predeterminado de B = 0.75 funciona bien en todas las funciones de cuantización (Figura 4). Después de sintonizar en un amplio rango de valores bajo varias funciones de cuantización, seleccionamos valores de k = 10.0 y b = 0.80 para nuestros experimentos INEX 2004, y estos valores se usan para los experimentos informados en la Sección 7. 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.130.14 0.15 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 Precisión mediana (INEX-2002) B estricto SOG generalizado Figura 4: Impacto de B en la precisión promedio media INEX-2002 con K1 = 10 (temas de CO INEX 2003).5. Control de superposición Comenzando con una clasificación de elementos generada por el método de línea de base descrito en la sección anterior, los elementos se vuelven a clasificar para controlar la superposición ajustando iterativamente las puntuaciones de los elementos contenidos o contenidos en elementos de clasificación más altos. En un nivel conceptual, el reanimiento del rango procede de la siguiente manera: 1. Informe el elemento de clasificación más alto.2. Ajuste los puntajes de los elementos no reportados.3. Repita los pasos 1 y 2 hasta que se informen los elementos M. Un enfoque para ajustar las puntuaciones de elementos no reportados en el Paso 2 podría basarse en las puntuaciones OKAPI BM25 de los elementos involucrados. Por ejemplo, suponga que un párrafo con puntaje P se informa en el paso 1. En el paso 2, la sección que contiene el párrafo podría tener su puntaje en una cantidad α · P para reflejar la contribución reducida que el párrafo debe hacer a la puntuación de las secciones. En un contexto relacionado, Robertson et al.[20] argumentan fuertemente contra la combinación lineal de las puntuaciones de Okapi de esta manera. Ese trabajo considera el problema de asignar diferentes pesos a diferentes campos de documentos, como el título y el cuerpo asociados con las páginas web. Un enfoque común para este problema puntúa el título y el cuerpo por separado y genera una puntuación final como una combinación lineal de los dos. Robertson et al.Discuta los defectos teóricos en este enfoque y demuestre experimentalmente que en realidad puede dañar la efectividad de la recuperación. En cambio, aplican los pesos al nivel de frecuencia del término, con una aparición de un término de consulta T en el título, lo que hace una mayor contribución a la puntuación que una ocurrencia en el cuerpo. En la ecuación 1, XT se convierte en α0 · yt + α1 · zt, donde yt es el número de veces que ocurre en el título y ZT es el número de veces que ocurre en el cuerpo. Traduciendo este enfoque a nuestro contexto, la contribución de los términos que aparecen en los elementos se reduce dinámicamente como se informa. La siguiente sección presenta y análisis un algoritmo de reanimiento simple que sigue esta estrategia. El algoritmo se evalúa experimentalmente en la Sección 7. Una limitación del algoritmo es que la contribución de los términos que aparecen en los elementos informados se reduce por el mismo factor independientemente del número de elementos informados en los que aparece. En la Sección 8, el algoritmo se extiende para aplicar pesos crecientes, reduciendo la puntuación, cuando un término aparece en más de un elemento informado.6. Algoritmo de rango El algoritmo de reanimiento funciona sobre árboles XML, como el que aparece en la Figura 2. La entrada al algoritmo es una lista de n elementos clasificados de acuerdo con sus puntajes iniciales de BM25. Durante la clasificación inicial, el árbol XML se reconstruye dinámicamente para incluir solo aquellos nodos con puntajes BM25 distintos de cero, por lo que N puede ser considerablemente menor que | n |. La salida del algoritmo es una lista de los principales elementos M, clasificado de acuerdo con sus puntajes ajustados. Un elemento está representado por el nodo x ∈ N en su raíz. Asociados con este nodo están los campos que almacenan la longitud del elemento, las frecuencias de término y otra información requerida por el algoritmo de re -rango, de la siguiente manera: X.F - Vector de frecuencia de término X.G - Ajustes de frecuencia de término X.L - Longitud de elementos X. -H -S -Según Okapi BM25puntaje X. Reportado - BOOLEAN BLAG, inicialmente falso X.Children - Conjunto de nodos infantiles X.Parent - Nodo principal, si existe uno, estos campos están poblados durante el proceso de clasificación inicial y se actualizan a medida que avanza el algoritmo. El Vector X.F contiene información de frecuencia de término correspondiente a cada término en la consulta. El Vector X.G es inicialmente cero y es actualizado por el algoritmo a medida que se informan elementos. El campo de puntuación contiene la puntuación BM25 actual para el elemento, que cambiará a medida que los valores en X.G cambian. La puntuación se calcula utilizando la Ecuación 1, con el valor XT para cada término determinado por una combinación de los valores en X.F y X.G. Dado un término t ∈ Q, deje que FT sea el componente de X.F correspondiente a t, y sea GT el componente de x.g correspondiente a t, entonces: xt = ft-α · gt (2) para procesarse por el algoritmo de re-rangoLos nodos se almacenan en colas prioritarias, ordenadas al disminuir la puntuación. Cada cola prioritaria PQ admite tres operaciones: PQ.Front () - Devuelve el nodo con la mejor puntuación PQ.Add (X) - Agrega el nodo X a la cola PQ.Remove (X) - Elimina el nodo X de la cola cuando se implementa usando estándarEstructuras de datos, la operación frontal requiere o (1) tiempo, y las otras operaciones requieren tiempo O (log n), donde n es el tamaño de la cola. El núcleo del algoritmo de rango se presenta en la Figura 5. El algoritmo toma como entrada la cola de prioridad s que contiene la clasificación inicial, y produce los nodos reorganizados de TOP-M en la cola prioritaria F. Después de inicializar F para estar vacía en la línea 1, el algoritmo es m veces sobre las líneas 215, transfiriendo al menosun nodo de S a F durante cada iteración. Al comienzo de cada iteración, el nodo no declarado en la parte delantera de S tiene la mayor puntuación ajustada, y se elimina y se agrega a F.

Las rutinas transversales del árbol, arriba y abajo se dan en la Figura 6. La rutina UP elimina cada nodo del antepasado de S, ajusta sus valores de frecuencia de término, recomputa su puntaje y lo agrega nuevamente a S. El ajuste de los valores de frecuencia del término (línea 3) se suma a Y.G solo las ocurrencias de término previamente no reportadas en x.La recomputación de la puntuación en la línea 4 usa las ecuaciones 1 y 2. La rutina hacia abajo realiza una operación similar en cada descendiente. Sin embargo, dado que el contenido de cada descendiente está completamente contenido en un elemento informado, su puntaje final puede calcularse, y se elimina de S y se agrega a F. Para determinar la complejidad del tiempo del algoritmo, primero nota que un nodo puedeSea un argumento a lo máximo una vez. A partir de entonces, la bandera reportada de su padre es verdadera. Durante cada llamada a abajo, un nodo puede moverse de S a F, lo que requiere el tiempo O (log n). Por lo tanto, el tiempo total para todas las llamadas a Down es o (n log n), y podemos ignorar temporalmente las líneas 8-10 de la Figura 5 al considerar la complejidad del tiempo del bucle sobre las líneas 2-15. Durante cada iteración de este bucle, un nodo y cada uno de sus antepasados se eliminan de una cola de prioridad y luego se agregan nuevamente a una cola de prioridad. Dado que un nodo puede tener en la mayoría de los antepasados H, donde H es la altura máxima de cualquier árbol en la colección, cada una de las intensiones requiere tiempo O (H log n). La combinación de estas observaciones produce una complejidad de tiempo general de log N ((n + mh) log n). En la práctica, volver a clasificar un conjunto de resultados de INEX requiere menos de 200 ms en una PC de escritorio de tres años.7. Evaluación Ninguna de las métricas descritas en la Sección 3.3 es un ajuste cercano con la vista de la superposición defendida por este documento. No obstante, cuando se unen, proporcionan información sobre el comportamiento del algoritmo de reanimiento. Los paquetes de evaluación INEX (INEX_EVAL e INEX_EVAL_NG) se usaron para calcular valores para las métricas INEX-2002 e INEX-2003. Los valores para las métricas XCG se calcularon utilizando software suministrado por sus inventores [11]. La Figura 7 traza las tres variantes de la métrica del mapa INEX-2002 junto con la métrica XCG. Valores para estas métricas 0.0 0.0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 0.20 0.0 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 Precisión mediaConsiderado Figura 8: Impacto de α en el mapa INEX-2003 (temas de CO INEX 2004; conjunto de evaluación I).se trazan para valores de α entre 0.0 y 1.0. Recordando que la métrica XCG está diseñada para penalizar la superposición, mientras que la métrica INEX-2002 ignora la superposición, el conflicto entre las métricas es obvio. Los valores de MAP en un valor extremo (α = 0.0) y el valor XCG en el otro extremo (α = 1.0) representan un rendimiento de recuperación comparable a los mejores sistemas en INEX 2004 [8,12]. Figura 8 Los valores de los gráficos de la métrica del mapa INEX-2003 para dos cuantizaciones, con y sin consideración de superposición. Una vez más, el conflicto es evidente, con la influencia de α sustancialmente disminuida cuando se considera la superposición.8. Algoritmo extendido Una limitación del algoritmo de reanimiento es que se usa un solo peso α para ajustar las puntuaciones de los antepasados y descendientes de los elementos informados. Una extensión obvia es usar diferentes pesos en estos dos casos. Además, el mismo peso se usa independientemente del número de veces que un elemento se contiene en un elemento informado. Por ejemplo, un párrafo puede formar parte de una sección informada y luego formar parte de un artículo informado. Dado que el usuario ahora puede haber visto este párrafo dos veces, su puntaje debe reducirse aún más al aumentar el valor del peso. Motivado por estas observaciones, el algoritmo de reango puede extenderse con una serie de pesos 1 = β0 ≥ β1 ≥ β2 ≥ ... ≥ βm ≥ 0. donde βj es el peso aplicado a un nodo que ha sido descendiente de unNodo J Times informado. Tenga en cuenta que un límite superior en M es H, la altura máxima de cualquier árbol XML en la colección. Sin embargo, en la práctica M es probable que M sea relativamente pequeño (quizás 3 o 4). La Figura 9 presenta reemplazos para las rutinas ascendentes de la Figura 6, incorporando esta serie de pesos. Se requiere un campo adicional en cada nodo, de la siguiente manera: X.J - Cuenta hacia abajo El valor de X.J se establece inicialmente en cero en todos los nodos y se incrementa cada vez que se llama con X como argumento. Al calcular la puntuación del nodo, el valor de x.j selecciona 1 up (x, y) ≡ 2 si no Y. reportado, entonces 3 s.remove (y) 4 y.g ← y.g + x.f - x.g 5 recomputar y. -anotación 6 S.Agregue (y) 8 Si y no es un nodo raíz, entonces 9 hacia arriba (x, y.parent) 10 final si 11 termina si 12 13 hacia abajo (x) ≡ 14 si x.j <m entonces 15 x.j ← x.j + 1 16 si noX. Reportado luego 17 S.Remove (x) 18 Recompute X.Score 19 S.Add (x) 20 Fin Si 21 foreach y ∈ X. Los niños hacen 22 hacia abajo (y) 23 Fin Hacer 24 End si Figura 9: Árbol extendidoRutinas de transversal.El peso que se aplicará al nodo ajustando el valor de XT en la ecuación 1, de la siguiente manera: XT = βx.j · (ft - α · gt) (3) donde Ft y Gt son los componentes de X.F y X.G correspondientes atérmino t.Se requieren algunos cambios adicionales para extenderse hacia arriba y hacia abajo. La rutina UP retornos inmediatamente (línea 2) si su argumento ya se ha informado, ya que las frecuencias de términos ya se han ajustado en sus antepasados. La rutina de abajo no informa su argumento, sino que recomputa su puntaje y la agrega nuevamente a S. Un nodo no puede ser un argumento a la baja más de M +1 veces, lo que a su vez implica una complejidad de tiempo general de O ((NM +mh) log n). Como M ≤ H y M ≤ N, la complejidad del tiempo también es O (NH log n).9. Discusión final Al generar resultados de recuperación en una colección XML, se debe tolerar algunas superposiciones en los resultados y puede ser beneficioso. Por ejemplo, cuando un elemento altamente exhaustivo y bastante específico (3,2) contiene un elemento mucho más pequeño (2,3), ambos deben informarse al usuario, y los algoritmos de recuperación y las métricas de evaluación deberían respetar esta relación. El algoritmo presentado en este documento Controles se superpone ponderando los términos que ocurren en los elementos informados para reflejar su importancia reducida. Otros enfoques también pueden ayudar a controlar la superposición. Por ejemplo, cuando los resultados de recuperación de XML se presentan a los usuarios, puede ser deseable agrupar elementos estructuralmente relacionados juntos, ilustrando visualmente las relaciones entre ellos. Si bien este estilo de interfaz de usuario puede ayudar a un usuario a hacer frente a la superposición, la estrategia presentada en este documento continúa siendo aplicable, determinando los mejores elementos para incluir en cada clúster. En Waterloo, seguimos desarrollando y probando nuestras ideas para INEX 2005. En particular, estamos investigando métodos para aprender los pesos α y βJ. También estamos reevaluando nuestro enfoque para documentar las estadísticas y examinar los ajustes apropiados al parámetro K1 a medida que cambian los pesos de término [20].10.

        "Elements overlap each other - articles contain sections, sections contain subsections, and subsections contain paragraphs.",
        "Each of these characteristics affects the design of an XML IR system, and each leads to fundamental problems that must be solved in an successful system.",
        "Most of these fundamental problems can be solved through the careful adaptation of standard IR techniques, but the problems caused by overlap are unique to this area [4,11] and form the primary focus of this paper.",

        "For example, many of the elements in figure 2 would receive a high score on the keyword query text index compression algorithms.",
        "If each of these elements are presented to a user as an individual and separate result, she may waste considerable time reviewing and rejecting redundant content.",
        "One possible solution is to report only the highest scoring element along a given path in the tree, and to remove from the lower ranks any element containing it, or contained within it.",
        "Unfortunately, this approach destroys some of the possible benefits of XML IR.",
        "For example, an outer element may contain a substantial amount of information that does not appear in an inner element, but the inner element may be heavily focused on the query topic and provide a short overview of the key concepts.",
        "In such cases, it is reasonable to report elements which contain, or are contained in, higher ranking elements.",
        "Even when an entire book is relevant, a user may still wish to have the most important paragraphs highlighted, to guide her reading and to save time [6].",

        "Starting with an initial element ranking, a re-ranking algorithm adjusts the scores of lower ranking elements that contain, or are contained within, higher ranking elements, reflecting the fact that this information may now be redundant.",
        "For example, once an element representing a section appears in the ranking, the scores for the paragraphs it contains and the article that contains it are reduced.",
        "The inspiration for this strategy comes partially from recent work on structured documents retrieval, where terms appearing in different fields, such as the title and body, are given different weights [20].",
        "Extending that approach, the re-ranking algorithm varies weights dynamically as elements are processed.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: After a discussion of background work and evaluation methodology, a baseline retrieval method is presented in section 4.",

        "BACKGROUND This section provides a general overview of XML information retrieval and discusses related work, with an emphasis on the fundamental problems mentioned in the introduction.",
        "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
        "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
        "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
        "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
        "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
        "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
        "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
        "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
        "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
        "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
        "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
        "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
        "An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
        "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8].",
        "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
        "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
        "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
        "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
        "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
        "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",
        "Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3.",
        "INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology.",
        "For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002.",
        "Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
        "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
        "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
        "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
        "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
        "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
        "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
        "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
        "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own XML IR system.",
        "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
        "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
        "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
        "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
        "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
        "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",
        "This variant is essentially the familiar MAP value, with (3,3) elements treated as relevant and all other elements treated as not relevant.",
        "Other quantization functions are designed to give partial credit to elements which are near misses, due to a lack or exhaustivity and/or specificity.",
        "Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function placing greater emphasis on specificity.",
        "This paper reports results of this metric using all three of these quantization functions.",
        "Since this metric was first introduced at INEX 2002, it is generally referred as the inex-2002 metric.",
        "The inex-2002 metric does not penalize overlap.",
        "In particular, both the generalized and sog quantization functions give partial credit to a near miss even when a (3,3) element overlapping it is reported at a higher rank.",
        "To address this problem, Kazai et al. [11] propose an XML cumulated gain metric, which compares the cumulated gain [9] of a ranked list to an ideal gain vector.",
        "This ideal gain vector is constructed from the relevance judgments by eliminating overlap and retaining only best element along a given path.",
        "Thus, the XCG metric rewards retrieval runs that avoid overlap.",
        "While XCG was not used officially at INEX 2004, a version of it is likely to be used in the future.",
        "At INEX 2003, yet another metric was introduced to ameliorate the perceived limitations of the inex-2002 metric.",
        "This inex-2003 metric extends the definitions of precision and recall to consider both the size of reported components and the overlap between them.",
        "Two versions were created, one that considered only component size and another that considered both size and overlap.",
        "While the inex-2003 metric exhibits undesirable anomalies [11], and was not used in 2004, values are reported in the evaluation section to provide an additional instrument for investigating overlap. 4.",

        "The MultiText system performed respectably at INEX 2004, placing in the top ten under all of the quantization functions, and placing first when the quantization function emphasized exhaustivity.",
        "To support retrieval from XML and other structured document types, the system provides generalized queries of the form: rank X by Y where X is a sub-query specifying a set of document elements to be ranked and Y is a vector of sub-queries specifying individual retrieval terms.",
        "For our INEX 2004 runs, the sub-query X specified a list of retrievable elements as those with tag names as follows: abs app article bb bdy bm fig fm ip1 li p sec ss1 ss2 vt This list includes bibliographic entries (bb) and figure captions (fig) as well as paragraphs, sections and subsections.",
        "Prior to INEX 2004, the INEX collection and the INEX 2003 relevance judgments were manually analyzed to select these tag names.",
        "Tag names were selected on the basis of their frequency in the collection, the average size of their associated elements, and the relative number of positive relevance judgments they received.",
        "Automating this selection process is planned as future work.",
        "For INEX 2004, the term vector Y was derived from the topic by splitting phrases into individual words, eliminating stopwords and negative terms (those starting with -), and applying a stemmer.",

        "CONTROLLING OVERLAP Starting with an element ranking generated by the baseline method described in the previous section, elements are re-ranked to control overlap by iteratively adjusting the scores of those elements containing or contained in higher ranking elements.",
        "At a conceptual level, re-ranking proceeds as follows: 1.",
        "Report the highest ranking element. 2.",
        "Adjust the scores of the unreported elements. 3.",
        "Repeat steps 1 and 2 until m elements are reported.",
        "One approach to adjusting the scores of unreported elements in step 2 might be based on the Okapi BM25 scores of the involved elements.",
        "For example, assume a paragraph with score p is reported in step 1.",
        "In step 2, the section containing the paragraph might then have its score s lowered by an amount α · p to reflect the reduced contribution the paragraph should make to the sections score.",
        "In a related context, Robertson et al. [20] argue strongly against the linear combination of Okapi scores in this fashion.",
        "That work considers the problem of assigning different weights to different document fields, such as the title and body associated with Web pages.",
        "A common approach to this problem scores the title and body separately and generates a final score as a linear combination of the two.",
        "Robertson et al. discuss the theoretical flaws in this approach and demonstrate experimentally that it can actually harm retrieval effectiveness.",
        "Instead, they apply the weights at the term frequency level, with an occurrence of a query term t in the title making a greater contribution to the score than an occurrence in the body.",
        "In equation 1, xt becomes α0 · yt + α1 · zt, where yt is the number of times t occurs in the title and zt is the number of times t occurs in the body.",
        "Translating this approach to our context, the contribution of terms appearing in elements is dynamically reduced as they are reported.",
        "The next section presents and analysis a simple re-ranking algorithm that follows this strategy.",
        "The algorithm is evaluated experimentally in section 7.",
        "One limitation of the algorithm is that the contribution of terms appearing in reported elements is reduced by the same factor regardless of the number of reported elements in which it appears.",
        "In section 8 the algorithm is extended to apply increasing weights, lowering the score, when a term appears in more than one reported element. 6.",
        "RE-RANKING ALGORITHM The re-ranking algorithm operates over XML trees, such as the one appearing in figure 2.",
        "Input to the algorithm is a list of n elements ranked according to their initial BM25 scores.",
        "During the initial ranking the XML tree is dynamically re-constructed to include only those nodes with nonzero BM25 scores, so n may be considerably less than |N |.",

        "Given a term t ∈ Q, let ft be the component of x.f corresponding to t, and let gt be the component of x.g corresponding to t, then: xt = ft − α · gt (2) For processing by the re-ranking algorithm, nodes are stored in priority queues, ordered by decreasing score.",
        "Each priority queue PQ supports three operations: PQ.front() - returns the node with greatest score PQ.add (x) - adds node x to the queue PQ.remove(x) - removes node x from the queue When implemented using standard data structures, the front operation requires O(1) time, and the other operations require O(log n) time, where n is the size of the queue.",
        "The core of the re-ranking algorithm is presented in figure 5.",

        "An obvious extension is to use different weights in these two cases.",
        "Furthermore, the same weight is used regardless of the number of times an element is contained in a reported element.",
        "For example, a paragraph may form part of a reported section and then form part of a reported article.",
        "Since the user may now have seen this paragraph twice, its score should be further lowered by increasing the value of the weight.",

A few additional changes are required to extend Up and Down.",
        "The Up routine returns immediately (line 2) if its argument has already been reported, since term frequencies have already been adjusted in its ancestors.",
        "The Down routine does not report its argument, but instead recomputes its score and adds it back into S. A node cannot be an argument to Down more than M +1 times, which in turn implies an overall time complexity of O((nM + mh) log n).",

        "CONCLUDING DISCUSSION When generating retrieval results over an XML collection, some overlap in the results should be tolerated, and may be beneficial.",
        "For example, when a highly exhaustive and fairly specific (3,2) element contains a much smaller (2,3) element, both should be reported to the user, and retrieval algorithms and evaluation metrics should respect this relationship.",
        "The algorithm presented in this paper controls overlap by weighting the terms occurring in reported elements to reflect their reduced importance.",
        "Other approaches may also help to control overlap.",
        "For example, when XML retrieval results are presented to users it may be desirable to cluster structurally related elements together, visually illustrating the relationships between them.",
        "While this style of user interface may help a user cope with overlap, the strategy presented in this paper continues to be applicable, by determining the best elements to include in each cluster.",

                "For example, an outer element may contain a substantial amount of information that does not appear in an inner element, but the inner element may be heavily focused on the query topic and provide a short overview of the key concepts.",

                "Even when an entire book is relevant, a user may still wish to have the most important paragraphs highlighted, to guide her reading and to save time [6].",

                "The inspiration for this strategy comes partially from recent work on structured documents retrieval, where terms appearing in different fields, such as the title and body, are given different weights [20].",

                "BACKGROUND This section provides a general overview of XML <br>information retrieval</br> and discusses related work, with an emphasis on the fundamental problems mentioned in the introduction.",
                "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional <br>information retrieval</br> applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML <br>information retrieval</br> technology [7,8].",
                "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",
                "Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3.",
                "INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology.",
                "For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002.",
                "Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
                "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
                "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
                "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
                "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
                "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
                "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
                "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
                "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own XML IR system.",
                "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
                "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
                "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
                "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
                "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
                "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",
                "This variant is essentially the familiar MAP value, with (3,3) elements treated as relevant and all other elements treated as not relevant.",
                "Other quantization functions are designed to give partial credit to elements which are near misses, due to a lack or exhaustivity and/or specificity.",
                "Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function placing greater emphasis on specificity.",
                "This paper reports results of this metric using all three of these quantization functions.",
                "Since this metric was first introduced at INEX 2002, it is generally referred as the inex-2002 metric.",
                "The inex-2002 metric does not penalize overlap.",
                "In particular, both the generalized and sog quantization functions give partial credit to a near miss even when a (3,3) element overlapping it is reported at a higher rank.",
                "To address this problem, Kazai et al. [11] propose an XML cumulated gain metric, which compares the cumulated gain [9] of a ranked list to an ideal gain vector.",
                "This ideal gain vector is constructed from the relevance judgments by eliminating overlap and retaining only best element along a given path.",
                "Thus, the XCG metric rewards retrieval runs that avoid overlap.",
                "While XCG was not used officially at INEX 2004, a version of it is likely to be used in the future.",
                "At INEX 2003, yet another metric was introduced to ameliorate the perceived limitations of the inex-2002 metric.",
                "This inex-2003 metric extends the definitions of precision and recall to consider both the size of reported components and the overlap between them.",
                "Two versions were created, one that considered only component size and another that considered both size and overlap.",
                "While the inex-2003 metric exhibits undesirable anomalies [11], and was not used in 2004, values are reported in the evaluation section to provide an additional instrument for investigating overlap. 4.",
                "BASELINE RETRIEVAL METHOD This section provides an overview of baseline XML <br>information retrieval</br> method currently used in the MultiText IR system, developed by the <br>information retrieval</br> Group at the University of Waterloo [3].",

                "The MultiText system performed respectably at INEX 2004, placing in the top ten under all of the quantization functions, and placing first when the quantization function emphasized exhaustivity.",
                "To support retrieval from XML and other structured document types, the system provides generalized queries of the form: rank X by Y where X is a sub-query specifying a set of document elements to be ranked and Y is a vector of sub-queries specifying individual retrieval terms.",
                "For our INEX 2004 runs, the sub-query X specified a list of retrievable elements as those with tag names as follows: abs app article bb bdy bm fig fm ip1 li p sec ss1 ss2 vt This list includes bibliographic entries (bb) and figure captions (fig) as well as paragraphs, sections and subsections.",

                "In step 2, the section containing the paragraph might then have its score s lowered by an amount α · p to reflect the reduced contribution the paragraph should make to the sections score.",

                "For example, when a highly exhaustive and fairly specific (3,2) element contains a much smaller (2,3) element, both should be reported to the user, and retrieval algorithms and evaluation metrics should respect this relationship.",

                "This facility is of particular benefit when a collection contains very long documents, such as product manuals or books, where the user should be directed to the most relevant portions of these documents. <article> <fm> <atl>Text Compression for Dynamic Document Databases</atl> <au>Alistair Moffat</au> <au>Justin Zobel</au> <au>Neil Sharman</au> <abs><p><b>Abstract</b> For ...</p></abs> </fm> <bdy> <sec><st>INTRODUCTION</st> <ip1>Modern document databases...</ip1> <p>There are good reasons to compress...</p> </sec> <sec><st>REDUCING MEMORY REQUIREMENTS</st>... <ss1><st>2.1 Method A</st>... </sec> ... </bdy> </article> Figure 1: A journal article encoded in XML.",
                "Figure 1 provides an example of a journal article encoded in XML, illustrating many of the important characteristics of XML documents.",
                "Tags indicate the beginning and end of each element, with elements varying widely in size, from one word to thousands of words.",
                "Some elements, such as paragraphs and sections, may be reasonably presented to the user as retrieval results, but others are not appropriate.",
                "Elements overlap each other - articles contain sections, sections contain subsections, and subsections contain paragraphs.",
                "Each of these characteristics affects the design of an <br>xml ir</br> system, and each leads to fundamental problems that must be solved in an successful system.",
                "Most of these fundamental problems can be solved through the careful adaptation of standard IR techniques, but the problems caused by overlap are unique to this area [4,11] and form the primary focus of this paper.",
                "The article of figure 1 may be viewed as an XML tree, as illustrated in figure 2.",
                "Formally, a collection of XML documents may be represented as a forest of ordered, rooted trees, consisting of a set of nodes N and a set of directed edges E connecting these nodes.",
                "For each node x ∈ N , the notation x.parent refers to the parent node of x, if one exists, and the notation x.children refers to the set of child nodes sec bdyfm atl au au au abs p b st ip1 sec st ss1 st article p Figure 2: Example XML tree. of x.",
                "Since an element may be represented by the node at its root, the output of an <br>xml ir</br> system may be viewed as a ranked list of the top-m nodes.",
                "The direct application of a standard relevance ranking technique to a set of XML elements can produce a result in which the top ranks are dominated by many structurally related elements.",
                "A high scoring section is likely to contain several high scoring paragraphs and to be contained in an high scoring article.",
                "For example, many of the elements in figure 2 would receive a high score on the keyword query text index compression algorithms.",
                "If each of these elements are presented to a user as an individual and separate result, she may waste considerable time reviewing and rejecting redundant content.",
                "One possible solution is to report only the highest scoring element along a given path in the tree, and to remove from the lower ranks any element containing it, or contained within it.",
                "Unfortunately, this approach destroys some of the possible benefits of <br>xml ir</br>.",
                "For example, an outer element may contain a substantial amount of information that does not appear in an inner element, but the inner element may be heavily focused on the query topic and provide a short overview of the key concepts.",
                "In such cases, it is reasonable to report elements which contain, or are contained in, higher ranking elements.",
                "Even when an entire book is relevant, a user may still wish to have the most important paragraphs highlighted, to guide her reading and to save time [6].",
                "This paper presents a method for controlling overlap.",
                "Starting with an initial element ranking, a re-ranking algorithm adjusts the scores of lower ranking elements that contain, or are contained within, higher ranking elements, reflecting the fact that this information may now be redundant.",
                "For example, once an element representing a section appears in the ranking, the scores for the paragraphs it contains and the article that contains it are reduced.",
                "The inspiration for this strategy comes partially from recent work on structured documents retrieval, where terms appearing in different fields, such as the title and body, are given different weights [20].",
                "Extending that approach, the re-ranking algorithm varies weights dynamically as elements are processed.",
                "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: After a discussion of background work and evaluation methodology, a baseline retrieval method is presented in section 4.",
                "This baseline method represents a reasonable adaptation of standard IR technology to XML.",
                "Section 5 then outlines a strategy for controlling overlap, using the baseline method as a starting point.",
                "A re-ranking algorithm implementing this strategy is presented in section 6 and evaluated in section 7.",
                "Section 8 discusses an extended version of the algorithm. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND This section provides a general overview of XML information retrieval and discusses related work, with an emphasis on the fundamental problems mentioned in the introduction.",
                "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of <br>xml ir</br>, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an <br>xml ir</br> system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective <br>xml ir</br> system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8].",
                "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of <br>xml ir</br> as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",
                "Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3.",
                "INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology.",
                "For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002.",
                "Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
                "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
                "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
                "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
                "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
                "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
                "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
                "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
                "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own <br>xml ir</br> system.",
                "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since <br>xml ir</br> is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
                "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
                "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
                "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
                "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
                "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",
                "This variant is essentially the familiar MAP value, with (3,3) elements treated as relevant and all other elements treated as not relevant.",
                "Other quantization functions are designed to give partial credit to elements which are near misses, due to a lack or exhaustivity and/or specificity.",
                "Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function placing greater emphasis on specificity.",
                "This paper reports results of this metric using all three of these quantization functions.",
                "Since this metric was first introduced at INEX 2002, it is generally referred as the inex-2002 metric.",
                "The inex-2002 metric does not penalize overlap.",
                "In particular, both the generalized and sog quantization functions give partial credit to a near miss even when a (3,3) element overlapping it is reported at a higher rank.",
                "To address this problem, Kazai et al. [11] propose an XML cumulated gain metric, which compares the cumulated gain [9] of a ranked list to an ideal gain vector.",
                "This ideal gain vector is constructed from the relevance judgments by eliminating overlap and retaining only best element along a given path.",
                "Thus, the XCG metric rewards retrieval runs that avoid overlap.",
                "While XCG was not used officially at INEX 2004, a version of it is likely to be used in the future.",
                "At INEX 2003, yet another metric was introduced to ameliorate the perceived limitations of the inex-2002 metric.",
                "This inex-2003 metric extends the definitions of precision and recall to consider both the size of reported components and the overlap between them.",
                "Two versions were created, one that considered only component size and another that considered both size and overlap.",
                "While the inex-2003 metric exhibits undesirable anomalies [11], and was not used in 2004, values are reported in the evaluation section to provide an additional instrument for investigating overlap. 4.",
                "BASELINE RETRIEVAL METHOD This section provides an overview of baseline XML information retrieval method currently used in the MultiText IR system, developed by the Information Retrieval Group at the University of Waterloo [3].",
                "This retrieval method results from the adaptation and tuning of the Okapi BM25 measure [21] to the XML information retrieval task.",
                "The MultiText system performed respectably at INEX 2004, placing in the top ten under all of the quantization functions, and placing first when the quantization function emphasized exhaustivity.",
                "To support retrieval from XML and other structured document types, the system provides generalized queries of the form: rank X by Y where X is a sub-query specifying a set of document elements to be ranked and Y is a vector of sub-queries specifying individual retrieval terms.",
                "For our INEX 2004 runs, the sub-query X specified a list of retrievable elements as those with tag names as follows: abs app article bb bdy bm fig fm ip1 li p sec ss1 ss2 vt This list includes bibliographic entries (bb) and figure captions (fig) as well as paragraphs, sections and subsections.",
                "Prior to INEX 2004, the INEX collection and the INEX 2003 relevance judgments were manually analyzed to select these tag names.",
                "Tag names were selected on the basis of their frequency in the collection, the average size of their associated elements, and the relative number of positive relevance judgments they received.",
                "Automating this selection process is planned as future work.",
                "For INEX 2004, the term vector Y was derived from the topic by splitting phrases into individual words, eliminating stopwords and negative terms (those starting with -), and applying a stemmer.",
                "For example, keyword field of topic 166 +tree edit distance + XML -image became the four-term query $tree $edit $distance $xml where the $ operator within a quoted string stems the term that follows it.",

                "Following the suggestion of Kamps et al. [10], the retrieval results are filtered to eliminate very short elements, those less than 25 words in length.",
                "The use of article statistics for all element types might be questioned.",
                "This approach may be justified by viewing the collection as a set of articles to be searched using standard document-oriented techniques, where only articles may be returned.",

                "For example, once an element representing a section appears in the ranking, the scores for the paragraphs it contains and the article that contains it are reduced.",
                "The inspiration for this strategy comes partially from recent work on structured documents retrieval, where terms appearing in different fields, such as the title and body, are given different weights [20].",

                "Section 8 discusses an extended version of the algorithm. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND This section provides a general overview of XML information retrieval and discusses related work, with an emphasis on the fundamental problems mentioned in the introduction.",
                "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8].",
                "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",
                "Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3.",
                "INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology.",
                "For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002.",
                "Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
                "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
                "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
                "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
                "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
                "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
                "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
                "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
                "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own XML IR system.",
                "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
                "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
                "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
                "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
                "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
                "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",
                "This variant is essentially the familiar MAP value, with (3,3) elements treated as relevant and all other elements treated as not relevant.",
                "Other quantization functions are designed to give partial credit to elements which are near misses, due to a lack or exhaustivity and/or specificity.",
                "Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function placing greater emphasis on specificity.",
                "This paper reports results of this metric using all three of these quantization functions.",
                "Since this metric was first introduced at INEX 2002, it is generally referred as the inex-2002 metric.",
                "The inex-2002 metric does not penalize overlap.",
                "In particular, both the generalized and sog quantization functions give partial credit to a near miss even when a (3,3) element overlapping it is reported at a higher rank.",
                "To address this problem, Kazai et al. [11] propose an XML cumulated gain metric, which compares the cumulated gain [9] of a ranked list to an ideal gain vector.",
                "This ideal gain vector is constructed from the relevance judgments by eliminating overlap and retaining only best element along a given path.",
                "Thus, the XCG metric rewards retrieval runs that avoid overlap.",
                "While XCG was not used officially at INEX 2004, a version of it is likely to be used in the future.",
                "At INEX 2003, yet another metric was introduced to ameliorate the perceived limitations of the inex-2002 metric.",
                "This inex-2003 metric extends the definitions of precision and recall to consider both the size of reported components and the overlap between them.",
                "Two versions were created, one that considered only component size and another that considered both size and overlap.",
                "While the inex-2003 metric exhibits undesirable anomalies [11], and was not used in 2004, values are reported in the evaluation section to provide an additional instrument for investigating overlap. 4.",

                "To support retrieval from XML and other structured document types, the system provides generalized queries of the form: rank X by Y where X is a sub-query specifying a set of document elements to be ranked and Y is a vector of sub-queries specifying individual retrieval terms.",
                "For our INEX 2004 runs, the sub-query X specified a list of retrievable elements as those with tag names as follows: abs app article bb bdy bm fig fm ip1 li p sec ss1 ss2 vt This list includes bibliographic entries (bb) and figure captions (fig) as well as paragraphs, sections and subsections.",

                "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (<br>inex</br>) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8].",
                "<br>inex</br> is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in <br>inex</br> 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by <br>inex</br>.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the <br>inex</br> organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of <br>inex</br> retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",

                "Instead, the <br>inex</br> organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",

                "The algorithm presented in this paper controls overlap by weighting the terms occurring in reported elements to reflect their reduced importance.",
                "Other approaches may also help to control overlap.",
                "For example, when XML retrieval results are presented to users it may be desirable to cluster structurally related elements together, visually illustrating the relationships between them.",
                "While this style of user interface may help a user cope with overlap, the strategy presented in this paper continues to be applicable, by determining the best elements to include in each cluster.",

                "BACKGROUND This section provides a general overview of XML information retrieval and discusses related work, with an emphasis on the fundamental problems mentioned in the introduction.",
                "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8].",
                "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",
                "Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3.",
                "INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology.",
                "For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002.",
                "Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
                "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
                "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
                "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
                "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
                "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
                "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
                "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
                "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own XML IR system.",
                "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
                "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
                "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
                "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
                "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
                "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",

                "BACKGROUND This section provides a general overview of XML information retrieval and discusses related work, with an emphasis on the fundamental problems mentioned in the introduction.",
                "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8].",
                "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",
                "Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3.",
                "INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology.",
                "For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002.",
                "Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
                "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
                "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
                "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
                "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
                "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
                "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
                "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
                "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own XML IR system.",
                "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
                "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
                "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
                "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
                "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
                "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",
                "This variant is essentially the familiar MAP value, with (3,3) elements treated as relevant and all other elements treated as not relevant.",
                "Other quantization functions are designed to give partial credit to elements which are near misses, due to a lack or exhaustivity and/or specificity.",
                "Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function placing greater emphasis on specificity.",
                "This paper reports results of this metric using all three of these quantization functions.",
                "Since this metric was first introduced at INEX 2002, it is generally referred as the inex-2002 metric.",
                "The inex-2002 metric does not penalize overlap.",
                "In particular, both the generalized and sog quantization functions give partial credit to a near miss even when a (3,3) element overlapping it is reported at a higher rank.",
                "To address this problem, Kazai et al. [11] propose an <br>xml cumulated gain metric</br>, which compares the cumulated gain [9] of a ranked list to an ideal gain vector.",
                "This ideal gain vector is constructed from the relevance judgments by eliminating overlap and retaining only best element along a given path.",
                "Thus, the XCG metric rewards retrieval runs that avoid overlap.",
                "While XCG was not used officially at INEX 2004, a version of it is likely to be used in the future.",
                "At INEX 2003, yet another metric was introduced to ameliorate the perceived limitations of the inex-2002 metric.",
                "This inex-2003 metric extends the definitions of precision and recall to consider both the size of reported components and the overlap between them.",
                "Two versions were created, one that considered only component size and another that considered both size and overlap.",
                "While the inex-2003 metric exhibits undesirable anomalies [11], and was not used in 2004, values are reported in the evaluation section to provide an additional instrument for investigating overlap. 4.",
                "BASELINE RETRIEVAL METHOD This section provides an overview of baseline XML information retrieval method currently used in the MultiText IR system, developed by the Information Retrieval Group at the University of Waterloo [3].",
                "This retrieval method results from the adaptation and tuning of the Okapi BM25 measure [21] to the XML information retrieval task.",
                "The MultiText system performed respectably at INEX 2004, placing in the top ten under all of the quantization functions, and placing first when the quantization function emphasized exhaustivity.",
                "To support retrieval from XML and other structured document types, the system provides generalized queries of the form: rank X by Y where X is a sub-query specifying a set of document elements to be ranked and Y is a vector of sub-queries specifying individual retrieval terms.",
                "For our INEX 2004 runs, the sub-query X specified a list of retrievable elements as those with tag names as follows: abs app article bb bdy bm fig fm ip1 li p sec ss1 ss2 vt This list includes bibliographic entries (bb) and figure captions (fig) as well as paragraphs, sections and subsections.",
                "Prior to INEX 2004, the INEX collection and the INEX 2003 relevance judgments were manually analyzed to select these tag names.",
                "Tag names were selected on the basis of their frequency in the collection, the average size of their associated elements, and the relative number of positive relevance judgments they received.",
                "Automating this selection process is planned as future work.",
                "For INEX 2004, the term vector Y was derived from the topic by splitting phrases into individual words, eliminating stopwords and negative terms (those starting with -), and applying a stemmer.",
                "For example, keyword field of topic 166 +tree edit distance + XML -image became the four-term query $tree $edit $distance $xml where the $ operator within a quoted string stems the term that follows it.",
                "Our implementation of Okapi BM25 is derived from the formula of Robertson et al. [21] by setting parameters k2 = 0 and k3 = ∞.",

                "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8].",
                "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",
                "Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3.",
                "INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology.",
                "For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002.",
                "Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
                "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
                "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
                "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
                "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
                "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
                "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
                "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
                "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own XML IR system.",
                "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
                "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
                "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
                "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
                "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
                "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",
                "This variant is essentially the familiar MAP value, with (3,3) elements treated as relevant and all other elements treated as not relevant.",
                "Other quantization functions are designed to give partial credit to elements which are near misses, due to a lack or exhaustivity and/or specificity.",
                "Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function placing greater emphasis on specificity.",
                "This paper reports results of this metric using all three of these quantization functions.",
                "Since this metric was first introduced at INEX 2002, it is generally referred as the inex-2002 metric.",
                "The inex-2002 metric does not penalize overlap.",
                "In particular, both the generalized and sog quantization functions give partial credit to a near miss even when a (3,3) element overlapping it is reported at a higher rank.",
                "To address this problem, Kazai et al. [11] propose an XML <br>cumulated gain</br> metric, which compares the <br>cumulated gain</br> [9] of a ranked list to an ideal gain vector.",
                "This ideal gain vector is constructed from the relevance judgments by eliminating overlap and retaining only best element along a given path.",
                "Thus, the XCG metric rewards retrieval runs that avoid overlap.",
                "While XCG was not used officially at INEX 2004, a version of it is likely to be used in the future.",
                "At INEX 2003, yet another metric was introduced to ameliorate the perceived limitations of the inex-2002 metric.",
                "This inex-2003 metric extends the definitions of precision and recall to consider both the size of reported components and the overlap between them.",
                "Two versions were created, one that considered only component size and another that considered both size and overlap.",
                "While the inex-2003 metric exhibits undesirable anomalies [11], and was not used in 2004, values are reported in the evaluation section to provide an additional instrument for investigating overlap. 4.",
                "BASELINE RETRIEVAL METHOD This section provides an overview of baseline XML information retrieval method currently used in the MultiText IR system, developed by the Information Retrieval Group at the University of Waterloo [3].",
                "This retrieval method results from the adaptation and tuning of the Okapi BM25 measure [21] to the XML information retrieval task.",
                "The MultiText system performed respectably at INEX 2004, placing in the top ten under all of the quantization functions, and placing first when the quantization function emphasized exhaustivity.",
                "To support retrieval from XML and other structured document types, the system provides generalized queries of the form: rank X by Y where X is a sub-query specifying a set of document elements to be ranked and Y is a vector of sub-queries specifying individual retrieval terms.",
                "For our INEX 2004 runs, the sub-query X specified a list of retrievable elements as those with tag names as follows: abs app article bb bdy bm fig fm ip1 li p sec ss1 ss2 vt This list includes bibliographic entries (bb) and figure captions (fig) as well as paragraphs, sections and subsections.",
                "Prior to INEX 2004, the INEX collection and the INEX 2003 relevance judgments were manually analyzed to select these tag names.",
                "Tag names were selected on the basis of their frequency in the collection, the average size of their associated elements, and the relative number of positive relevance judgments they received.",

                "Even when an entire book is relevant, a user may still wish to have the most important paragraphs highlighted, to guide her reading and to save time [6].",
                "This paper presents a method for controlling overlap.",
                "Starting with an initial element ranking, a re-ranking algorithm adjusts the scores of lower ranking elements that contain, or are contained within, higher ranking elements, reflecting the fact that this information may now be redundant.",
                "For example, once an element representing a section appears in the ranking, the scores for the paragraphs it contains and the article that contains it are reduced.",
                "The inspiration for this strategy comes partially from recent work on structured documents retrieval, where terms appearing in different fields, such as the title and body, are given different weights [20].",
                "Extending that approach, the re-ranking algorithm varies weights dynamically as elements are processed.",
                "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: After a discussion of background work and evaluation methodology, a baseline retrieval method is presented in section 4.",
                "This baseline method represents a reasonable adaptation of standard IR technology to XML.",
                "Section 5 then outlines a strategy for controlling overlap, using the baseline method as a starting point.",
                "A re-ranking algorithm implementing this strategy is presented in section 6 and evaluated in section 7.",
                "Section 8 discusses an extended version of the algorithm. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND This section provides a general overview of XML information retrieval and discusses related work, with an emphasis on the fundamental problems mentioned in the introduction.",
                "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8].",
                "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",
                "Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3.",
                "INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology.",
                "For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002.",
                "Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
                "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
                "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
                "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
                "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
                "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
                "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
                "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
                "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own XML IR system.",
                "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
                "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
                "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
                "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
                "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
                "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",
                "This variant is essentially the familiar MAP value, with (3,3) elements treated as relevant and all other elements treated as not relevant.",
                "Other quantization functions are designed to give partial credit to elements which are near misses, due to a lack or exhaustivity and/or specificity.",
                "Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function placing greater emphasis on specificity.",
                "This paper reports results of this metric using all three of these quantization functions.",
                "Since this metric was first introduced at INEX 2002, it is generally referred as the inex-2002 metric.",
                "The inex-2002 metric does not penalize overlap.",
                "In particular, both the generalized and sog quantization functions give partial credit to a near miss even when a (3,3) element overlapping it is reported at a higher rank.",
                "To address this problem, Kazai et al. [11] propose an XML cumulated gain metric, which compares the cumulated gain [9] of a ranked list to an <br>ideal gain vector</br>.",
                "This <br>ideal gain vector</br> is constructed from the relevance judgments by eliminating overlap and retaining only best element along a given path.",
                "Thus, the XCG metric rewards retrieval runs that avoid overlap.",
                "While XCG was not used officially at INEX 2004, a version of it is likely to be used in the future.",
                "At INEX 2003, yet another metric was introduced to ameliorate the perceived limitations of the inex-2002 metric.",
                "This inex-2003 metric extends the definitions of precision and recall to consider both the size of reported components and the overlap between them.",
                "Two versions were created, one that considered only component size and another that considered both size and overlap.",
                "While the inex-2003 metric exhibits undesirable anomalies [11], and was not used in 2004, values are reported in the evaluation section to provide an additional instrument for investigating overlap. 4.",

                "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8].",
                "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",

                "Unfortunately, this approach destroys some of the possible benefits of XML IR.",
                "For example, an outer element may contain a substantial amount of information that does not appear in an inner element, but the inner element may be heavily focused on the query topic and provide a short overview of the key concepts.",
                "In such cases, it is reasonable to report elements which contain, or are contained in, higher ranking elements.",
                "Even when an entire book is relevant, a user may still wish to have the most important paragraphs highlighted, to guide her reading and to save time [6].",

                "The inspiration for this strategy comes partially from recent work on structured documents retrieval, where terms appearing in different fields, such as the title and body, are given different weights [20].",

                "Section 8 discusses an extended version of the algorithm. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND This section provides a general overview of XML information retrieval and discusses related work, with an emphasis on the fundamental problems mentioned in the introduction.",
                "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8].",
                "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",
                "Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3.",
                "INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology.",
                "For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002.",
                "Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
                "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
                "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
                "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
                "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
                "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
                "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
                "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
                "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own XML IR system.",
                "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
                "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
                "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
                "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
                "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
                "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",
                "This variant is essentially the familiar MAP value, with (3,3) elements treated as relevant and all other elements treated as not relevant.",
                "Other quantization functions are designed to give partial credit to elements which are near misses, due to a lack or exhaustivity and/or specificity.",
                "Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function placing greater emphasis on specificity.",
                "This paper reports results of this metric using all three of these quantization functions.",
                "Since this metric was first introduced at INEX 2002, it is generally referred as the inex-2002 metric.",
                "The inex-2002 metric does not penalize overlap.",
                "In particular, both the generalized and sog quantization functions give partial credit to a near miss even when a (3,3) element overlapping it is reported at a higher rank.",
                "To address this problem, Kazai et al. [11] propose an XML cumulated gain metric, which compares the cumulated gain [9] of a ranked list to an ideal gain vector.",
                "This ideal gain vector is constructed from the relevance judgments by eliminating overlap and retaining only best element along a given path.",
                "Thus, the XCG metric rewards retrieval runs that avoid overlap.",
                "While XCG was not used officially at INEX 2004, a version of it is likely to be used in the future.",
                "At INEX 2003, yet another metric was introduced to ameliorate the perceived limitations of the inex-2002 metric.",
                "This inex-2003 metric extends the definitions of precision and recall to consider both the size of reported components and the overlap between them.",
                "Two versions were created, one that considered only component size and another that considered both size and overlap.",
                "While the inex-2003 metric exhibits undesirable anomalies [11], and was not used in 2004, values are reported in the evaluation section to provide an additional instrument for investigating overlap. 4.",
                "BASELINE RETRIEVAL METHOD This section provides an overview of baseline XML information retrieval method currently used in the MultiText IR system, developed by the Information Retrieval Group at the University of Waterloo [3].",
                "This retrieval method results from the adaptation and tuning of the Okapi BM25 measure [21] to the XML information retrieval task.",
                "The <br>multitext system</br> performed respectably at INEX 2004, placing in the top ten under all of the quantization functions, and placing first when the quantization function emphasized exhaustivity.",

                "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8].",
                "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",
                "Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3.",
                "INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology.",
                "For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002.",
                "Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
                "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
                "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
                "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
                "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
                "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
                "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
                "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
                "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own XML IR system.",
                "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
                "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
                "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
                "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
                "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
                "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",
                "This variant is essentially the familiar MAP value, with (3,3) elements treated as relevant and all other elements treated as not relevant.",
                "Other quantization functions are designed to give partial credit to elements which are near misses, due to a lack or exhaustivity and/or specificity.",
                "Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function placing greater emphasis on specificity.",
                "This paper reports results of this metric using all three of these quantization functions.",
                "Since this metric was first introduced at INEX 2002, it is generally referred as the inex-2002 metric.",
                "The inex-2002 metric does not penalize overlap.",
                "In particular, both the generalized and sog quantization functions give partial credit to a near miss even when a (3,3) element overlapping it is reported at a higher rank.",
                "To address this problem, Kazai et al. [11] propose an XML cumulated gain metric, which compares the cumulated gain [9] of a ranked list to an ideal gain vector.",
                "This ideal gain vector is constructed from the relevance judgments by eliminating overlap and retaining only best element along a given path.",
                "Thus, the XCG metric rewards retrieval runs that avoid overlap.",
                "While XCG was not used officially at INEX 2004, a version of it is likely to be used in the future.",
                "At INEX 2003, yet another metric was introduced to ameliorate the perceived limitations of the inex-2002 metric.",
                "This inex-2003 metric extends the definitions of precision and recall to consider both the size of reported components and the overlap between them.",
                "Two versions were created, one that considered only component size and another that considered both size and overlap.",
                "While the inex-2003 metric exhibits undesirable anomalies [11], and was not used in 2004, values are reported in the evaluation section to provide an additional instrument for investigating overlap. 4.",
                "BASELINE RETRIEVAL METHOD This section provides an overview of baseline XML information retrieval method currently used in the MultiText IR system, developed by the Information Retrieval Group at the University of Waterloo [3].",
                "This retrieval method results from the adaptation and tuning of the Okapi BM25 measure [21] to the XML information retrieval task.",
                "The MultiText system performed respectably at INEX 2004, placing in the top ten under all of the quantization functions, and placing first when the quantization function emphasized exhaustivity.",
                "To support retrieval from XML and other structured document types, the system provides generalized queries of the form: rank X by Y where X is a sub-query specifying a set of document elements to be ranked and Y is a vector of sub-queries specifying individual retrieval terms.",
                "For our INEX 2004 runs, the sub-query X specified a list of retrievable elements as those with tag names as follows: abs app article bb bdy bm fig fm ip1 li p sec ss1 ss2 vt This list includes bibliographic entries (bb) and figure captions (fig) as well as paragraphs, sections and subsections.",
                "Prior to INEX 2004, the INEX collection and the INEX 2003 relevance judgments were manually analyzed to select these tag names.",
                "Tag names were selected on the basis of their frequency in the collection, the average size of their associated elements, and the relative number of positive relevance judgments they received.",
                "Automating this selection process is planned as future work.",
                "For INEX 2004, the term vector Y was derived from the topic by splitting phrases into individual words, eliminating stopwords and negative terms (those starting with -), and applying a stemmer.",
                "For example, keyword field of topic 166 +tree edit distance + XML -image became the four-term query $tree $edit $distance $xml where the $ operator within a quoted string stems the term that follows it.",

                "Following the suggestion of Kamps et al. [10], the retrieval results are filtered to eliminate very short elements, those less than 25 words in length.",
                "The use of article statistics for all element types might be questioned.",
                "This approach may be justified by viewing the collection as a set of articles to be searched using standard document-oriented techniques, where only articles may be returned.",

                "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8].",
                "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",
                "Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3.",
                "INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology.",
                "For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002.",
                "Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
                "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
                "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
                "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
                "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
                "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
                "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
                "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
                "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own XML IR system.",
                "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
                "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
                "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
                "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
                "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
                "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",
                "This variant is essentially the familiar MAP value, with (3,3) elements treated as relevant and all other elements treated as not relevant.",
                "Other quantization functions are designed to give partial credit to elements which are near misses, due to a lack or exhaustivity and/or specificity.",
                "Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function placing greater emphasis on specificity.",
                "This paper reports results of this metric using all three of these quantization functions.",
                "Since this metric was first introduced at INEX 2002, it is generally referred as the inex-2002 metric.",
                "The inex-2002 metric does not penalize overlap.",
                "In particular, both the generalized and sog quantization functions give partial credit to a near miss even when a (3,3) element overlapping it is reported at a higher rank.",
                "To address this problem, Kazai et al. [11] propose an XML cumulated gain metric, which compares the cumulated gain [9] of a ranked list to an ideal gain vector.",
                "This ideal gain vector is constructed from the relevance judgments by eliminating overlap and retaining only best element along a given path.",
                "Thus, the XCG metric rewards retrieval runs that avoid overlap.",
                "While XCG was not used officially at INEX 2004, a version of it is likely to be used in the future.",
                "At INEX 2003, yet another metric was introduced to ameliorate the perceived limitations of the inex-2002 metric.",
                "This inex-2003 metric extends the definitions of precision and recall to consider both the size of reported components and the overlap between them.",
                "Two versions were created, one that considered only component size and another that considered both size and overlap.",
                "While the inex-2003 metric exhibits undesirable anomalies [11], and was not used in 2004, values are reported in the evaluation section to provide an additional instrument for investigating overlap. 4.",
                "BASELINE RETRIEVAL METHOD This section provides an overview of baseline XML information retrieval method currently used in the MultiText IR system, developed by the Information Retrieval Group at the University of Waterloo [3].",
                "This retrieval method results from the adaptation and tuning of the Okapi BM25 measure [21] to the XML information retrieval task.",
                "The MultiText system performed respectably at INEX 2004, placing in the top ten under all of the quantization functions, and placing first when the quantization function emphasized exhaustivity.",
                "To support retrieval from XML and other structured document types, the system provides generalized queries of the form: rank X by Y where X is a sub-query specifying a set of document elements to be ranked and Y is a vector of sub-queries specifying individual retrieval terms.",
                "For our INEX 2004 runs, the sub-query X specified a list of retrievable elements as those with tag names as follows: abs app article bb bdy bm fig fm ip1 li p sec ss1 ss2 vt This list includes bibliographic entries (bb) and figure captions (fig) as well as paragraphs, sections and subsections.",
                "Prior to INEX 2004, the INEX collection and the INEX 2003 relevance judgments were manually analyzed to select these tag names.",
                "Tag names were selected on the basis of their frequency in the collection, the average size of their associated elements, and the relative number of positive relevance judgments they received.",
                "Automating this selection process is planned as future work.",
                "For INEX 2004, the term vector Y was derived from the topic by splitting phrases into individual words, eliminating stopwords and negative terms (those starting with -), and applying a stemmer.",
                "For example, keyword field of topic 166 +tree edit distance + XML -image became the four-term query $tree $edit $distance $xml where the $ operator within a quoted string stems the term that follows it.",

                "This approach may be justified by viewing the collection as a set of articles to be searched using standard document-oriented techniques, where only articles may be returned.",

                "Each of these characteristics affects the design of an XML IR system, and each leads to fundamental problems that must be solved in an successful system.",
                "Most of these fundamental problems can be solved through the careful adaptation of standard IR techniques, but the problems caused by overlap are unique to this area [4,11] and form the primary focus of this paper.",

                "Since an element may be represented by the node at its root, the output of an XML IR system may be viewed as a ranked list of the top-m nodes.",
                "The direct application of a standard relevance ranking technique to a set of XML elements can produce a result in which the top ranks are dominated by many structurally related elements.",
                "A high scoring section is likely to contain several high scoring paragraphs and to be contained in an high scoring article.",
                "For example, many of the elements in figure 2 would receive a high score on the keyword query text index compression algorithms.",
                "If each of these elements are presented to a user as an individual and separate result, she may waste considerable time reviewing and rejecting redundant content.",
                "One possible solution is to report only the highest scoring element along a given path in the tree, and to remove from the lower ranks any element containing it, or contained within it.",
                "Unfortunately, this approach destroys some of the possible benefits of XML IR.",
                "For example, an outer element may contain a substantial amount of information that does not appear in an inner element, but the inner element may be heavily focused on the query topic and provide a short overview of the key concepts.",
                "In such cases, it is reasonable to report elements which contain, or are contained in, higher ranking elements.",
                "Even when an entire book is relevant, a user may still wish to have the most important paragraphs highlighted, to guide her reading and to save time [6].",

                "Starting with an initial element ranking, a re-ranking algorithm adjusts the scores of lower ranking elements that contain, or are contained within, higher ranking elements, reflecting the fact that this information may now be redundant.",
                "For example, once an element representing a section appears in the ranking, the scores for the paragraphs it contains and the article that contains it are reduced.",
                "The inspiration for this strategy comes partially from recent work on structured documents retrieval, where terms appearing in different fields, such as the title and body, are given different weights [20].",
                "Extending that approach, the re-ranking algorithm varies weights dynamically as elements are processed.",
                "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: After a discussion of background work and evaluation methodology, a baseline retrieval method is presented in section 4.",
                "This baseline method represents a reasonable adaptation of standard IR technology to XML.",
                "Section 5 then outlines a strategy for controlling overlap, using the baseline method as a starting point.",
                "A re-ranking algorithm implementing this strategy is presented in section 6 and evaluated in section 7.",
                "Section 8 discusses an extended version of the algorithm. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND This section provides a general overview of XML information retrieval and discusses related work, with an emphasis on the fundamental problems mentioned in the introduction.",
                "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8].",
                "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",
                "Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3.",
                "INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology.",
                "For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002.",
                "Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
                "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
                "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
                "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
                "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
                "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
                "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
                "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
                "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own XML IR system.",
                "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
                "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
                "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
                "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
                "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
                "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",
                "This variant is essentially the familiar MAP value, with (3,3) elements treated as relevant and all other elements treated as not relevant.",
                "Other quantization functions are designed to give partial credit to elements which are near misses, due to a lack or exhaustivity and/or specificity.",
                "Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function placing greater emphasis on specificity.",
                "This paper reports results of this metric using all three of these quantization functions.",
                "Since this metric was first introduced at INEX 2002, it is generally referred as the inex-2002 metric.",
                "The inex-2002 metric does not penalize overlap.",
                "In particular, both the generalized and sog quantization functions give partial credit to a near miss even when a (3,3) element overlapping it is reported at a higher rank.",
                "To address this problem, Kazai et al. [11] propose an XML cumulated gain metric, which compares the cumulated gain [9] of a ranked list to an ideal gain vector.",
                "This ideal gain vector is constructed from the relevance judgments by eliminating overlap and retaining only best element along a given path.",
                "Thus, the XCG metric rewards retrieval runs that avoid overlap.",
                "While XCG was not used officially at INEX 2004, a version of it is likely to be used in the future.",
                "At INEX 2003, yet another metric was introduced to ameliorate the perceived limitations of the inex-2002 metric.",
                "This inex-2003 metric extends the definitions of precision and recall to consider both the size of reported components and the overlap between them.",
                "Two versions were created, one that considered only component size and another that considered both size and overlap.",
                "While the inex-2003 metric exhibits undesirable anomalies [11], and was not used in 2004, values are reported in the evaluation section to provide an additional instrument for investigating overlap. 4.",
                "BASELINE RETRIEVAL METHOD This section provides an overview of baseline XML information retrieval method currently used in the MultiText IR system, developed by the Information Retrieval Group at the University of Waterloo [3].",
                "This retrieval method results from the adaptation and tuning of the Okapi BM25 measure [21] to the XML information retrieval task.",
                "The MultiText system performed respectably at INEX 2004, placing in the top ten under all of the quantization functions, and placing first when the quantization function emphasized exhaustivity.",
                "To support retrieval from XML and other structured document types, the system provides generalized queries of the form: rank X by Y where X is a sub-query specifying a set of document elements to be ranked and Y is a vector of sub-queries specifying individual retrieval terms.",
                "For our INEX 2004 runs, the sub-query X specified a list of retrievable elements as those with tag names as follows: abs app article bb bdy bm fig fm ip1 li p sec ss1 ss2 vt This list includes bibliographic entries (bb) and figure captions (fig) as well as paragraphs, sections and subsections.",
                "Prior to INEX 2004, the INEX collection and the INEX 2003 relevance judgments were manually analyzed to select these tag names.",
                "Tag names were selected on the basis of their frequency in the collection, the average size of their associated elements, and the relative number of positive relevance judgments they received.",

                "Section 8 discusses an extended version of the algorithm. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND This section provides a general overview of XML information retrieval and discusses related work, with an emphasis on the fundamental problems mentioned in the introduction.",
                "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8].",
                "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",
                "Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3.",
                "INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology.",
                "For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002.",
                "Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
                "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
                "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
                "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
                "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
                "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
                "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
                "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
                "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own XML IR system.",
                "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
                "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
                "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
                "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
                "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
                "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",
                "This variant is essentially the familiar MAP value, with (3,3) elements treated as relevant and all other elements treated as not relevant.",
                "Other quantization functions are designed to give partial credit to elements which are near misses, due to a lack or exhaustivity and/or specificity.",
                "Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function placing greater emphasis on specificity.",
                "This paper reports results of this metric using all three of these quantization functions.",
                "Since this metric was first introduced at INEX 2002, it is generally referred as the inex-2002 metric.",
                "The inex-2002 metric does not penalize overlap.",
                "In particular, both the generalized and sog quantization functions give partial credit to a near miss even when a (3,3) element overlapping it is reported at a higher rank.",
                "To address this problem, Kazai et al. [11] propose an XML cumulated gain metric, which compares the cumulated gain [9] of a ranked list to an ideal gain vector.",
                "This ideal gain vector is constructed from the relevance judgments by eliminating overlap and retaining only best element along a given path.",
                "Thus, the XCG metric rewards retrieval runs that avoid overlap.",
                "While XCG was not used officially at INEX 2004, a version of it is likely to be used in the future.",
                "At INEX 2003, yet another metric was introduced to ameliorate the perceived limitations of the inex-2002 metric.",
                "This inex-2003 metric extends the definitions of precision and recall to consider both the size of reported components and the overlap between them.",
                "Two versions were created, one that considered only component size and another that considered both size and overlap.",
                "While the inex-2003 metric exhibits undesirable anomalies [11], and was not used in 2004, values are reported in the evaluation section to provide an additional instrument for investigating overlap. 4.",

                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",

                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",

                "Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
                "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
                "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
                "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
                "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
                "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
                "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
                "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
                "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own XML IR system.",
                "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
                "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
                "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
                "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
                "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
                "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",
                "This variant is essentially the familiar MAP value, with (3,3) elements treated as relevant and all other elements treated as not relevant.",
                "Other quantization functions are designed to give partial credit to elements which are near misses, due to a lack or exhaustivity and/or specificity.",
                "Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function placing greater emphasis on specificity.",
                "This paper reports results of this metric using all three of these quantization functions.",
                "Since this metric was first introduced at INEX 2002, it is generally referred as the inex-2002 metric.",
                "The inex-2002 metric does not penalize overlap.",
                "In particular, both the generalized and sog quantization functions give partial credit to a near miss even when a (3,3) element overlapping it is reported at a higher rank.",
                "To address this problem, Kazai et al. [11] propose an XML cumulated gain metric, which compares the cumulated gain [9] of a ranked list to an ideal gain vector.",
                "This ideal gain vector is constructed from the relevance judgments by eliminating overlap and retaining only best element along a given path.",
                "Thus, the XCG metric rewards retrieval runs that avoid overlap.",
                "While XCG was not used officially at INEX 2004, a version of it is likely to be used in the future.",

                "Unfortunately, this approach destroys some of the possible benefits of <br>xml</br> IR.",
                "For example, an outer element may contain a substantial amount of information that does not appear in an inner element, but the inner element may be heavily focused on the query topic and provide a short overview of the key concepts.",
                "In such cases, it is reasonable to report elements which contain, or are contained in, higher ranking elements.",
                "Even when an entire book is relevant, a user may still wish to have the most important paragraphs highlighted, to guide her reading and to save time [6].",

                "BACKGROUND This section provides a general overview of <br>xml</br> information retrieval and discusses related work, with an emphasis on the fundamental problems mentioned in the introduction.",
                "Much research in the area of <br>xml</br> retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on <br>xml</br> documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of <br>xml</br> IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an <br>xml</br> IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective <br>xml</br> IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of <br>xml</br> Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into <br>xml</br> information retrieval technology [7,8].",
                "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of <br>xml</br> IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",
                "Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3.",
                "INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology.",
                "For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002.",
                "Each document is encoded in <br>xml</br> using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
                "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
                "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
                "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
                "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
                "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an <br>xml</br> query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
                "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
                "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
                "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own <br>xml</br> IR system.",
                "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since <br>xml</br> IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
                "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
                "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
                "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
                "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
                "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",

                "Even when an entire book is relevant, a user may still wish to have the most important paragraphs highlighted, to guide her reading and to save time [6].",

                "Section 8 discusses an extended version of the algorithm. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND This section provides a general overview of XML information retrieval and discusses related work, with an emphasis on the fundamental problems mentioned in the introduction.",
                "Much research in the area of XML retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].",
                "Here, we take a content oriented IR perceptive, focusing on XML documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.",
                "We assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the IR system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.",
                "Other IR research has considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23]. 2.1 Term and Document Statistics In traditional information retrieval applications the standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.",
                "Depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.",
                "When applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of XML IR, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics available for each [16].",
                "In addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g. inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.",
                "If we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.",
                "It is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23]. 2.2 Retrievable Elements While an XML IR system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.",
                "This is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].",
                "For example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.",
                "Other elements may reflect the documents physical, rather than logical, structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.",
                "An effective XML IR system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].",
                "Standard document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles, italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not. 2.3 Evaluation Methodology Over the past three years, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) has encouraged research into XML information retrieval technology [7,8].",
                "INEX is an experimental conference series, similar to TREC, with groups from different institutions completing one or more experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and comparing their results at the conference itself.",
                "Over 50 groups participated in INEX 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of XML IR as TREC is in other IR areas.",
                "The research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by INEX.",
                "Overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval evaluation, and the INEX organizers and participants have wrestled with these problems since the beginning.",
                "While substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.",
                "Kazai et al. [11] provide a detailed exposition of the overlap problem in the context of INEX retrieval evaluation and discuss both current and proposed evaluation metrics.",
                "Many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section. 3.",
                "INEX 2004 Space limitations prevent the inclusion of more than a brief summary of INEX 2004 tasks and evaluation methodology.",
                "For detailed information, the proceedings of the conference itself should be consulted [8]. 3.1 Tasks For the main experimental tasks, INEX 2004 participants were provided with a collection of 12,107 articles taken from the IEEE Computer Societies magazines and journals between 1995 and 2002.",
                "Each document is encoded in XML using a common DTD, with the document of figures 1 and 2 providing one example.",
                "At INEX 2004, the two main experimental tasks were both adhoc retrieval tasks, investigating the performance of systems searching a static collection using previously unseen topics.",
                "The two tasks differed in the types of topics they used.",
                "For one task, the content-only or CO task, the topics consist of short natural language statements with no direct reference to the structure of the documents in the collection.",
                "For this task, the IR system is required to select the elements to be returned.",
                "For the other task, the contentand-structure or CAS task, the topics are written in an XML query language [22] and contain explicit references to document structure, which the IR system must attempt to satisfy.",
                "Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.",
                "In 2004, 40 new CO topics were selected by the conference organizers from contributions provided by the conference participants.",
                "Each topic includes a short keyword query, which is executed over the collection by each participating group on their own XML IR system.",
                "Each group could submit up to three experimental runs consisting of the top m = 1500 elements for each topic. 3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide complete coverage of a topic while containing as little extraneous information as possible, simple relevant vs. not relevant judgments are not sufficient.",
                "Instead, the INEX organizers adopted two dimensions for relevance assessment: The exhaustivity dimension reflects the degree to which an element covers the topic, and the specificity dimension reflects the degree to which an element is focused on the topic.",
                "A four-point scale is used in both dimensions.",
                "Thus, a (3,3) element is highly exhaustive and highly specific, a (1,3) element is marginally exhaustive and highly specific, and a (0,0) element is not relevant.",
                "Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by various quantization functions to give different weights to different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.",
                "One variant, the strict quantization function gives a weight of 1 to (3,3) elements and a weight of 0 to all others.",
                "This variant is essentially the familiar MAP value, with (3,3) elements treated as relevant and all other elements treated as not relevant.",
                "Other quantization functions are designed to give partial credit to elements which are near misses, due to a lack or exhaustivity and/or specificity.",
                "Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function placing greater emphasis on specificity.",
                "This paper reports results of this metric using all three of these quantization functions.",
                "Since this metric was first introduced at INEX 2002, it is generally referred as the inex-2002 metric.",
                "The inex-2002 metric does not penalize overlap.",
                "In particular, both the generalized and sog quantization functions give partial credit to a near miss even when a (3,3) element overlapping it is reported at a higher <br>rank</br>.",
                "To address this problem, Kazai et al. [11] propose an XML cumulated gain metric, which compares the cumulated gain [9] of a ranked list to an ideal gain vector.",
                "This ideal gain vector is constructed from the relevance judgments by eliminating overlap and retaining only best element along a given path.",
                "Thus, the XCG metric rewards retrieval runs that avoid overlap.",
                "While XCG was not used officially at INEX 2004, a version of it is likely to be used in the future.",
                "At INEX 2003, yet another metric was introduced to ameliorate the perceived limitations of the inex-2002 metric.",
                "This inex-2003 metric extends the definitions of precision and recall to consider both the size of reported components and the overlap between them.",
                "Two versions were created, one that considered only component size and another that considered both size and overlap.",
                "While the inex-2003 metric exhibits undesirable anomalies [11], and was not used in 2004, values are reported in the evaluation section to provide an additional instrument for investigating overlap. 4.",
                "BASELINE RETRIEVAL METHOD This section provides an overview of baseline XML information retrieval method currently used in the MultiText IR system, developed by the Information Retrieval Group at the University of Waterloo [3].",
                "This retrieval method results from the adaptation and tuning of the Okapi BM25 measure [21] to the XML information retrieval task.",
