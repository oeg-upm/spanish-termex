In each search stage, each of the agents is randomly matched with several other agents in parallel, and makes a decision whether to accept a potential partnership with one of them. The distinguishing feature of the proposed model is that the agents are not restricted to maintaining a synchronized (instantaneous) decision protocol and can sequentially accept and reject partnerships within the same search stage. We analyze the dynamics which drive the agents strategies towards a stable equilibrium in the new model and show that the proposed search strategy weakly dominates the one currently in use for the two-sided parallel economic search model. By identifying several unique characteristics of the equilibrium we manage to efficiently bound the strategy space that needs to be explored by the agents and propose an efficient means for extracting the distributed equilibrium strategies in common environments.

INTRODUCTION A two-sided economic search is a distributed mechanism for forming agents pairwise partnerships [5].1 On every stage of the process, each of the agents is randomly matched with another agent 1 Notice that the concept of search here is very different from the classical definition of search in AI. While AI search is an active process in which an agent finds a sequence of actions that will bring it from the initial state to a goal state, economic search refers to the identification of the best agent to commit to a partnership with. and the two interact bilaterally in order to learn the benefit encapsulated in a partnership between them. The interaction does not involve bargaining thus each agent merely needs to choose between accepting or rejecting the partnership with the other agent. A typical market where this kind of two-sided search takes place is the marriage market [22]. Recent literature suggests various software agent-based applications where a two-sided distributed (i.e., with no centralized matching mechanisms) search takes place. An important class of such applications includes secondary markets for exchanging unexploited resources. An exchange mechanism is used in those cases where selling these resources is not the core business of the organization or when the overhead for selling them makes it non-beneficial. For example, through a twosided search, agents, representing different service providers, can exchange unused bandwidth [21] and communication satellites can transfer communication with a greater geographical coverage. Twosided agents-based search can also be found in applications of buyers and sellers in eMarkets and peer-to-peer applications. The twosided nature of the search suggests that a partnership between a pair of agents is formed only if it is mutually accepted. By forming a partnership the agents gain an immediate utility and terminate their search. When resuming the search, on the other hand, a more suitable partner might be found however some resources will need to be consumed for maintaining the search process. In this paper we focus on a specific class of two-sided search matching problems, in which the performance of the partnership applies to both parties, i.e., both gain an equal utility [13]. The equal utility scenario is usually applicable in domains where the partners gain from the synergy between them. For example, consider tennis players that seek partners when playing doubles (or a canoes paddler looking for a partner to practice with). Here the players are being rewarded completely based on the teams (rather than the individual) performance. Other examples are the scenario where students need to form pairs for working together on an assignment, for which both partners share the same grade, and the scenario where two buyer agents interested in similar or interchangeable products join forces to buy a product together, taking advantage of discount for quantity (i.e. each of them enjoys the same reduced price). In all these applications, any two agents can form a partnership and the performance of any given partnership depends on the skills or the characteristics of its members. Furthermore, the equal utility scenario can also hold whenever there is an option for side-payments and the partnerships overall utility is equally split among the two agents forming it [22]. While the two-sided search literature offers comprehensive equilibrium analysis for various models, it assumes that the agents search is conducted in a purely sequential manner: each agent locates and interacts with one other agent in its environment at a time 450 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS [5, 22]. Nevertheless, when the search is assigned to autonomous software agents a better search strategy can be used. Here an agent can take advantage of its unique inherent filtering and information processing capabilities and its ability to efficiently (in comparison to people) maintain concurrent interactions with several other agents at each stage of its search. Such use of parallel interactions in search is favorable whenever the average cost2 per interaction with another agent, when interacting in parallel with a batch of other agents, is smaller than the cost of maintaining one interaction at a time (i.e., advantage to size). For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21]. Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21]. However, the agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their decision making process. Thus each agent, upon reviewing the opportunities available in a specific search stage, has to notify all other agents of its decision whether to commit to a partnership (at most with one of them) or reject the partnership (with the rest of them). This inherent restriction imposes a significant limitation on the agents strategic behavior. In our model, the agents are free to notify the other agents of their decisions in an asynchronous manner. The asynchronous approach allows the agents to re-evaluate their strategy, based on each new response they receive from the agents they interact with. This leads to a sequential decision making process by which each agent, upon sending a commit message to one of the other agents, delays its decision concerning a commitment or rejection of all other potential partnerships until receiving a response from that agent (i.e., the agent still maintains parallel interactions in each search stage, except that its decision making process at the end of the stage is sequential rather than instantaneous). The new model is a much more realistic pairwise model and, as we show in the analysis section, is always preferred by any single agents participating in the process. In the absence of other economic two-sided parallel search models, we use the model that relies on an instantaneous (synchronous) decision making process [21] (denoted I-DM throughout the rest of the paper) as a benchmark for evaluating the usefulness of our proposed sequential (asynchronous) decision making strategy (denoted S-DM). The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model). This model is a general search model which can be applied in various (not necessarily software agents-based) domains. Second, we prove that the agents SDM strategy weakly dominates the I-DM strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the S-DM strategy when all other agents are using the I-DM strategy. Finally, by using an innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of different potential partnerships, we identify unique characteristics of the equilibrium strategies in the new model. These are used for supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the calculation of the agents equilibrium strategy. This latter contribution is 2 The term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for maintaining its search, such as: self advertisement, locating other agents, communicating with them and processing their offers. of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process). We manage to extract the agents new equilibrium strategies without increasing the computational complexity in comparison to the I-DM model. Throughout the paper we demonstrate the different properties of the new model and compare it with the I-DM model using an artificial synthetic environment. In the following section we formally present the S-DM model. An equilibrium analysis and computational means for finding the equilibrium strategy are provided in Section 3. In Section 4 we review related MAS and economic search theory literature. We conclude with a discussion and suggest directions for future research in Section 5. 2. MODEL AND ANALYSIS We consider an environment populated with an infinite number of self-interested fully rational agents of different types3 . Any agent Ai can form a partnership with any other agent Aj in the environment, associated with an immediate perceived utility U(Ai, Aj) for both agents. As in many other partnership formation models (see [5, 21]) we assume that the value of U(x, y) (where x and y are any two agents in the environment) is randomly drawn from a continuous population characterized with a probability distribution function (p.d.f.) f(U) and a cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) F(U), (0 ≤ U < ∞). The agents are assumed to be acquainted with the utility distribution function f(x), however they cannot tell a-priori what utility can be gained by a partnership with any specific agent in their environment. Therefore, the only way by which an agent Ai can learn the value of a partnership with another agent Aj, U(Ai, Aj), is by interacting with agent Aj. Since each agent in two-sided search models has no prior information concerning any of the other agents in its environment, it initiates interactions (i.e., search) with other agents randomly. The nature of the two-sided search application suggests that the agents are satisfied with having a single partner, thus once a partnership is formed the two agents forming it terminate their search process and leave the environment. The agents are not limited to interacting with a single potential partner agent at a time, but rather can select to interact with several other agents in parallel. We define a search round/stage as the interval in which the agent interacts with several agents in parallel and learns the utility of forming a partnership with each of them. Based on the learned values, the agent needs to decide whether to commit or reject each of the potential partnerships available to it. Commitment is achieved by sending a commit message to the appropriate agent and an agent cannot commit to more than one potential partnership simultaneously. Declining a partnership is achieved by sending a reject message. The communication between the agents is assumed to be asynchronous and each agent can delay its decision, concerning any given potential partnership, as necessary.4 If two agents Ai and Aj mutually commit to a partnership between 3 The infinite number of agents assumption is common in two-sided search models (see [5, 22, 21]). In many domains (e.g., eCommerce) this derives from the high entrance and leave rates, thus the probability of running into the same agent in a random match is negligible. 4 Notice that the asynchronous procedure does not eliminate the inherent structure of the search. The search is still based on stages/rounds where on each search round the agent interacts with several other agents, except that now the agent can delay its decision making process (within each search round) as necessary. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 451 them, then the partnership is formed and both agents gain the immediate utility U(Ai, Aj) associated with it. If an agent does not form a partnership in a given search stage, it continues to its next search stage and interacts with more agents in a similar manner. Given the option for asynchronous decision making, each individual agent, Ai, follows the following procedure: 1: loop 2: Set N (number of parallel interactions for next search round) 3: Locate randomly a set A = {A1, . . . , AN } of agents to interact with 4: Evaluate the set of utilities {U(Ai, A1), . . . , U(Ai, AN )} 5: Set A∗ ={Aj|Aj ∈A and U(Ai, Aj)>U(resume)} 6: Send a reject message to each agent in the set {A \\ A∗ } 7: while (A∗ = ∅) do 8: Send a commit message to Aj = argmaxAl∈A∗ U(Ai, Al) 9: Remove Aj from A∗ 10: Wait for Ajs decision 11: if (Aj responded commit) then 12: Send reject messages to the remaining agents in A∗ 13: Terminate search 14: end if 15: end while 16: end loop where U(resume) denotes the expected utility of continuing the search (in the following paragraphs we show that U(resume) is fixed throughout the search and derives from the agents strategy). In the above algorithm, any agent Ai first identifies the set A∗ of other agents it is willing to accept out of those reviewed in the current search stage and sends a reject message to the rest. Then it sends a commit message to the agent Aj ∈ A∗ that is associated with the partnership yielding the highest utility. If a reject message was received from agent Aj then this agent is removed from A∗ and a new commit message is sent according to the same criteria. The process continues until either: (a) the set A∗ becomes empty, in which case the agent initiates another search stage; or (b) a dual commitment is obtained, in which case the agent sends reject messages to the remaining agents in A∗ . The method differs from the one used in the I-DM model in the way it handles the commitment messages: in the I-DM model, after evaluating the set of utilities (step 4), the agent merely sends instantaneously a commit message to the agent associated with the greatest utility and a reject message to all the other agents it interacted with (as a replacement to steps 5-15 in the above procedure). Our proposed S-DM model is much more intuitive as it allows an agent to hold and possibly exploit relatively beneficial opportunities even if its first priority partnership is rejected by the other agent. In the I-DM model, on the other hand, since reject messages are sent alongside the commit message, simultaneously, a reject message from the agent associated with the best partnership enforces a new search round. Notice that the two-sided search mechanism above aligns with most other two-sided search mechanisms in a sense that it is based on random matching (i.e., in each search round the agent encounters a random sample of agents). While the maintenance of the random matching infrastructure is an interesting research question, it is beyond the scope of this paper. Notwithstanding, we do wish to emphasize that given the large number of agents in the environment and the fact that in MAS the turnover rate is quite substantial due to the open nature of the environment (and the interoperability between environments). Therefore, the probability of ending up interacting with the same agent more than once, when initiating a random interaction, is practically negligible. THEOREM 1. The S-DM agents decision making process: (a) is the optimal one (maximizes the utility) for any individual agent in the environment; and (b) guarantees a zero deadlock probability for any given agent in the environment. Proof: (a) The method is optimal since it cannot be changed in a way that produces a better utility for the agent. Since bargaining is not applicable here (benefits are non-divisible) then the agents strategy is limited to accepting or rejecting offers. The decision of rejecting a partnership in step 6 is based only on the immediate utility that can be gained from this partnership in comparison to the expected utility of resuming the search (i.e., moving on to the next search stage) and is not affected by the willingness of the other agents to commit or reject a partnership with Ai. As for partnerships that yield a utility greater than the expected utility of resuming the search (i.e., the partnerships with agents from the set A∗ ), the agent always prefers to delay its decision concerning partnerships of this type until receiving all notifications concerning potential partnerships that are associated with a greater immediate utility. The delay never results with a loss of opportunity since the other agents decision concerning this opportunity is not affected by agent Ais willingness to commit or reject this opportunity (but rather by the other agents estimation of its expected utility if resuming the search and the rejection messages it receives for more beneficial potential partnerships). Finally, the agent cannot benefit from delaying a commit message to the agent associated with the highest utility in A∗ , thus will always send it a commit message. (b) We first prove the following lemma that states that the probability of having two partnering opportunities associated with an identical utility is zero. LEMMA 2.1. When f is a continuous distribution function, then lim y→x »Z y z=x f(z)dz -2 ! = 0. Proof: since f is continuous and the interval between x and y is finite, by the intermediate value theorem (found in most calculus texts) there exists a c between x and y thatZ y z=x f(z)dz = f(c)(y − x) (intuitively, a rectangle with the base from z = x to z = y and height = f(c) has the same area as the integral on the left hand side.). Therefore »Z y z=x f(z)dz -2 = |f(c)|2 |y − x|2 When y → x, f(c) stays bounded due to continuity of f, moreover limy→x f(c) = f(x), hence lim y→x »Z y z=x f(z)dz -2 ! = f(x)2 lim y→x |y − x|2 = 0. . An immediate derivative from the above lemma is that no tiebreaking procedures are required and an agent in a waiting state is always waiting for a reply from the single agent that is associated with the highest utility among the agents in the set A∗ (i.e., no other agent in the set A∗ is associated with an equal utility). A deadlock can be formed only if we can create a cyclic sequence of agents in which any agent is waiting for a reply from the subsequent agent in the sequence. However, in our method any agent Ai will be waiting for a reply from another agent Aj, to which it sent a commit message, only if: (1) any agent Ak ∈ A, associated with a utility U(Ai, Ak) > U(Ai, Aj), has already rejected the partnership with agent Ai; and (2) agent Aj itself is waiting for a reply from agent Al where U(Al, Aj) > U(Aj, Ai). Therefore, if we have a sequence of waiting agents then the utility associated with partnerships between any two subsequent agents in the sequence must increase along the sequence. If the sequence is cyclic, then we have a 452 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) pattern of the form: U(Ai, Al) > U(Al, Aj) > U(Aj, Ai). Since U(Ai, Al) > U(Aj, Ai), agent Ai can be waiting for agent Aj only if it has already been rejected by Al (see (1) above). However, if agent Al has rejected agent Ai then it has also rejected agent Aj. Therefore, agent Aj cannot be waiting for agent Al to make a decision. The same logic can be applied to any longer sequence. 2 The search activity is assumed to be costly [11, 1, 16] in a way that any agent needs to consume some of its resources in order to locate other agents to interact with, and for maintaining the interactions themselves. We assume utilities and costs are additive and that the agents are trying to maximize their overall utility, defined as the utility from the partnership formed minus the aggregated search costs along the search process. The agents cost of interacting with N other agents (in parallel) is given by the function c(N). The search cost structure is principally a parameter of the environment and thus shared by all agents. An agents strategy S(A ) → {commit Aj ∈ A , reject A ⊂ A , N} defines for any given set of partnership opportunities, A , what is the subset of opportunities that should be immediately declined, to which agent to send a commit message (if no pending notification from another agent is expected) or the number of new interactions to initiate (N). Since the search process is two-sided, our goal is to find an equilibrium set of strategies for the agents. 2.1 Strategy Structure Recall that each agent declines partnerships based on (a) the partnerships immediate utility in comparison to the agents expected utility from resuming search; and (b) achieving a mutual commitment (thus declining pending partnerships that were not rejected in (a)). Therefore an agents strategy can be represented by a pair (Nt , xt ) where Nt is the number of agents with whom it chooses to interact in search stage t and xt is its reservation value5 (a threshold) for accepting/rejecting the resulting N potential partnerships. The subset A∗ , thus, will include all partnership opportunities of search stage t that are associated with a utility equal to or greater than xt . The reservation value xt is actually the expected utility for resuming the search at time t (i.e., U(resume)). The agent will always prefer committing to an opportunity greater than the expected utility of resuming the search and will always prefer to resume the search otherwise. Since the agents are not limited by a decision horizon, and their search process does not imply any new information about the market structure (e.g., about the utility distribution of future partnership opportunities), their strategy is stationary - an agent will not accept an opportunity it has rejected beforehand (i.e., x1 = x2 = ... = x) and will use the same sample size, N1 = N2 = ... = N, along its search. 2.2 Calculating Acceptance Probabilities The transition from instantaneous decision making process to a sequential one introduces several new difficulties in extracting the agents strategies. Now, in order to estimate the probability of being accepted by any of the other agents, the agent needs to recursively model, while setting its strategy, the probabilities of rejections other agents might face from other agents they interact with. In the following paragraphs we introduce several complementary definitions and notations, facilitating the formal introduction of the acceptance probabilities. Consider an agent Ai, using a strategy (N, xN ) while operating in an environment where all other agents 5 Notice the reservation value used here is different from a reservation price concept (that is usually used as buyers private evaluation). The use of reservation-value based strategies is common in economic search models [21, 17]. are using a strategy (k, xk). The probability that agent Ai will receive a commitment message from agent Aj it interacted with depends on the utility associated with the potential partnership between them, x. This probability, denoted by Gk(x) can be calculated as:6 Gk(x) = 8 >< >: „ 1 − Z ∞ y=x f(y)Gk(y)dy «k−1 if x ≥ xk 0 otherwise. (1) The case where x < xk above is trivial: none of the other agents will accept agent Ai if the utility in such a partnership is smaller than their reservation value xk. However even when the partnerships utility is greater or equal to xk, commitment is not guaranteed. In the latter scenario, a commitment message from agent Aj will be received only if agent Aj has been rejected by all other agents in its set A∗ that were associated with a utility greater than the utility of a partnership with agent Ai. The unique solution to the recursive Equation 1 is: Gk(x) = 8 >>>>>< >>>>>: 1+(k−2) R ∞ y=xf(y)dy 1−k k−2 , k>2, x≥xk, exp(− R ∞ y=x f(y)dy), k=2, x≥xk, 1, k=1, x≥xk 0, x < xk. (2) Notice that as expected, a partnership opportunity that yields the maximum mutual utility is necessarily accepted by both agents, i.e., limx→∞ Gk(x) = 1. On the other hand, when the utility associated with a potential partnership opportunity is zero (x = 0) the acceptance probability is non-negligible: lim x→0 Gk(x) = (k − 1) 1−k k−2 (3) This non-intuitive result derives from the fact that there is still a non-negligible probability that the other agent is rejected by all other agents it interacts with. 2.3 Setting the Agents Strategies Using the function Gk(x), we can now formulate and explore the agents expected utility when using their search strategies. Consider again an agent Ai that is using a sample of size N while all other agents are using a strategy (k, xk). We denote by RN (x) the probability that the maximum utility that agent Ai can be guaranteed when interacting with N agents (i.e., the highest utility to which a commit message will be received) is at most x. This can be calculated as the probability that none of N agents send agent Ai a commit message for a partnership associated with a utility greater than x: RN (x) = 1 − Z ∞ max(x,xk) f(y)Gk(y)dy N (4) Notice that RN (x) is in fact a cumulative distribution function, satisfying: limx→∞ RN (x) = 1 and dRN (x)/dx > 0 (the function never gets a zero value simply because there is always a positive probability that none of the agents commit at all to a partnership with agent Ai). Therefore, the derivative of the function RN (x), denoted rN (x), is in fact the probability distribution function of the maximum utility that can be guaranteed for agent Ai when sampling N other agents: rN (x) = dRN (x) dx = 8 < : Nf(x)Gk(x) N+k−2 k−1 , x ≥ xk 0, x < xk (5) 6 The use of the recursive Equation 1 is enabled since we assume that the number of agents is infinite (thus the probability of having an overlap between the interacting agents and the affect of such overlap on the probabilities we calculate become insignificant). The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 453 This function rN (x) is essential for calculating VN (xN ), the expected utility of agent Ai when using a strategy (N, xN ), given the strategy (k, xk) used by the other agents: VN (xN )= Z ∞ y=max(xN ,xk) yrN (y)dy+ 1− Z ∞ y=max(xN ,xk) rN (y)dy VN (xN ) − c(N) (6) The right hand side of the above equation represents the expected utility of agent Ai from taking an additional search stage. The first term represents the expected utility from mutual commitment scenarios, whereas the second term is the expected utility associated with resuming the search (which equals VN (xN ) since nothing has changed for the agent). Using simple mathematical manipulations and substituting rN (x), Equation 6 transforms into: VN (x) = R ∞ y=max(x,xk) yNf(y)Gk(y) N+k−2 k−1 dy − c(N) R ∞ y=max(x,xk) Nf(y)Gk(y) N+k−2 k−1 dy (7) and further simplified into: VN (x) = max(x, xk) + Z ∞ max(x,xk) (1 − Gk(y) N k−1 )dy − c(N) 1 − Gk(max(x, xk)) N k−1 (8) Equation 8, allows us to prove some important characteristics of the model as summarized in the following Theorem 2. THEOREM 2. When other agents use strategy (k, xk): (a) An agents expected utility function, VN (xN ), when using a strategy (N, x), is quasi concave in x with a unique maximum, obtained for the value xN satisfying: VN (xN ) = xN (9) (b) The value xN satisfies: c(N) = ` max(xN , xk) − xN ´` 1 − Gk(xk) N k−1 ´ + + Z ∞ max(xN ,xk) (1 − Gk(y) N k−1 )dy (10) The proof is obtained by deriving VN (xN ) in Equation 8 and setting it to zero. After applying further mathematical manipulations we obtain (9) and (10). Both parts of Theorem 2 can be used as an efficient means for extracting the optimal reservation value xN of an agent, given the strategies of the other agents in the environment and the number of parallel interactions it uses. Furthermore, in the case of complex distribution functions where extracting xN from Equation 10 is not immediate, a simple algorithm (principally based on binary search) can be constructed for calculating the agents optimal reservation value (which equals its expected utility, according to 9), with a complexity O(log( ˆx ρ )), where ρ is the required precision level for xN and ˆx is the solution to: R ∞ y=ˆx yNf(y)F(y)N−1 dy = c(N). Having the ability to calculate xN , we can now prove the following Proposition 2.1. PROPOSITION 2.1. An agent operating in an environment where all agents are using a strategy according to the instantaneous parallel search equilibrium (i.e., according to the I-DM model [21]) can only benefit from deviating to the proposed S-DM strategy. Sketch of proof: For the I-DM model the following holds [21]: c(N) = N 2N − 1 Z ∞ y=xI−DM N (1 − F(y)2N−1 )dy (11) We apply the methodology used above in this subsection for constructing the expected utility of the agent using the S-DM strategy as a function of its reservation value, assuming all other agents are using the I-DM search strategy. This results with an optimal reservation value for the agent using S-DM, satisfying: c(N) = Z ∞ y=xS−DM N (1 − (1 − 1 N + F(y)N N )N )dy (12) Finally, we prove that the integrand in Equation 11 is smaller than the integrand in Equation 12. Given the fact that both terms equal c(N), we obtain xS−DM N > xI−DM N and consequently (according to Theorem 2) a similar relationship in terms of expected utilities. Figure 1 illustrates the superiority of the proposed search strategy S-DM, as well as the expected utility functions characteristics (as reflected in Theorem 2). For comparative reasons we use the same synthetic environment that was used for the I-DM model [21]. Here the utilities are assumed to be drawn from a uniform distribution function and the cost function was taken to be c(N) = 0.05 + 0.005N. The agent is using N = 3 while other agents are using k = 25 and xk = 0.2. The different curves depict the expected utility of the agent as a function of the reservation value, x, that it uses, when: (a) all agents are using the I-DM strategy (marked as I-DM); (b) the agent is using the S-DM strategy while the other agents are using the I-DM strategy (marked as I-DM/SDM); and (c) all agents are using the S-DM strategy (marked as S-DM). As expected, according to Equation 8 and Theorem 2, the agents expected utility remains constant until its reservation value exceeds xk. Then, it reaches a global maximum when the reservation value satisfies VN (x) = x. From the graph we can see that the agent always has an incentive to deviate from the I-DM strategy to S-DM strategy (as was proven in Proposition 2.1). 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 reservation value (x) expected utility VN(x) S-D M I-D M I-D M / S-D M Figure 1: The expected utility as a function of the reservation value used by the agent 3. EQUILIBRIUM DYNAMICS Since all agents are subject to similar search costs, and their perceived utilities are drawn from the same distribution function, they all share the same strategy in equilibrium. A multi-equilibria scenario may occur, however as we discuss in the following paragraphs since all agents share the same preferences/priorities (unlike, for example, in the famous battle of the sexes scenario) we can always identify which equilibrium strategy will be used. Notice that if all agents are using the same sample size, N, then the value xN resulting from solving Equation 10 by substituting k = N and xk = xN is a stable reservation value (i.e., none of the agents can benefit from changing just the value of xN ). An equilibrium strategy (N, xN ) can be found by identifying an N value for which no single agent has an incentive to use a different number of parallel interactions, k (and the new optimal reservation 454 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) value that is associated with k according to Equation 10). While this implies an infinite solution space, we can always bound it using Equations 8 and 10. Within the framework of this paper, we demonstrate such a bounding methodology for the common case were c(N) is linear7 or convex, by using the following Theorem 3. THEOREM 3. When c(N) is linear (or convex), then: (a) When all other agents sample k potential partners over a search round, if an agents expected utility of sampling k + 1 potential partners, Vk+1(xk+1), is smaller than Vk(xk), then the expected utility when sampling N potential partners, VN (xN ), where N > k+1, is also smaller than Vk(xk). (b) Similarly, when all other agents sample k potential partners over a search round, if an agents expected utility of using k − 1 potential partners, Vk−1(xk−1), is smaller than the expected utility when using k potential partners, Vk(xk), then the expected utility when using N potential partners, where N < k − 1, is also smaller than Vk(xk). Proof: Let us use the notation ci for c(i). Since Vk(xk) = xk ∀k (according to Equation 9), the claims are: (a) if xk+1 < xk then xN < xk for all N ≥ k + 1, and (b) if xk−1 < xk then xN < xk for all N ≤ k − 1. (a) We start by proving that if xk+1 < xk then xk+2 < xk. Assume otherwise, i.e., xk+1 < xk and xk+2 > xk. Therefore, according to Equation 10, the following holds: 0 < ck+2 − 2ck+1 + ck < Z ∞ xk+2 (1 − Gk(y) k+2 k−1 )dy − 2 Z ∞ xk (1 − Gk(y) k+1 k−1 )dy + Z ∞ xk (1 − Gk(y) k k−1 )dy where the transition to inequality is valid since c(i) is convex. Since the assumption in this proof is that xk+2 > xk then the above can be transformed into: Z ∞ xk 2Gk(y) k+1 k−1 − Gk(y) k+2 k−1 − Gk(y) k k−1 dy > 0 (13) Now notice that the integrated term is actually −Gk(y) k k−1 ` 1− Gk(y) 1 k−1 ´2 which is obviously negative, contradicting the initial assumption, thus if xk+1 < xk then necessarily xk+2 < xk. Now we need to prove the same for any xk+j. We will prove this in two steps: first, if xk+i < xk then xk+2i < xk. Second, if xk+i < xk and xk+i+1 < xk, then xk+2i+1 < xk. Together these constitute the necessary induction arguments to prove the case (a). We start with the even case, using a similar methodology: Assume otherwise, i.e., xk+l < xk ∀l = 1, ..., j − 1 and xk+2i > xk. According to Equation 10, and the fact that c(i) is convex, the following holds: Z ∞ xk 2Gk(y) k+i k−1 − Gk(y) k+2i k−1 − Gk(y) k k−1 dy > 0 (14) And again the integrand is actually −Gk(y) k k−1 ` 1−Gk(y) i k−1 ´2 which is obviously negative, contradicting the initial assumption, thus xk+2i < xk. As for the odd case, we use Equation 10 once for k + i + 1 parallel interactions and once for k + 2i + 1. From the convexity of ci, we obtain: ck+2i+1 − ck+i − ck+i+1 + ck > 0, thus: Z ∞ xk ` Gk(y) k+i k−1 +Gk(y) k+i+1 k−1 −Gk(y) k+2i+1 k−1 −Gk(y) k k−1 ´ dy>0 (15) 7 A linear cost function is mostly common in agent-based two-sided search applications, since often the cost function can be divided into fixed costs (e.g. operating the agent per time unit) and variable costs (i.e., cost of processing a single interactions data). This time the integrated term in Equation 15 can be re-written as Gk(y) k k−1 (1 − Gk(y) i k−1 )(Gk(y) i+1 k−1 − 1) which is obviously negative, contradicting the initial assumption, thus xk+i+1 < xk. Now using induction one can prove that if xk+1 < xk then xk+i < xk. This concludes part (a) of the proof. The proof for part (b) of the theorem is obtained in a similar manner. In this case: ck − 2ck−i + ck−2i > 0 and ck − ck−i−1 − ck−i + ck−2i−1 > 0. The above theorem supplies us with a powerful tool for eliminating non-equilibrium N values. It suggests that we can check the stability of a sample size N and the appropriate reservation value xN simply by calculating the optimal reservation values of a single agent when deviating towards using samples of sizes N − 1 and N + 1 (keeping the other agents with strategy (N, xN )). If both the appropriate reservation values associated with the two latter sample sizes are smaller than xN then according to Theorems 3 the same holds when deviating to any other sample size k. The above process can be further simplified by using VN+1(xN ) > xN and VN−1(xN ) > xN as the two elimination rules. This derives from Theorem 3 and the properties of the function VN (x) found in Theorem 2. Notice that a multi-equilibria scenario may occur, however can easily be resolved. If several strategies satisfy the stability condition defined above, then the agents will always prefer the one associated with the highest expected utility. Therefore an algorithm that goes over the different N values and checks them according to the rules above can be applied, assuming that we can bound the interval for searching the equilibrium N. The following Theorem 4 suggests such an upper bound. THEOREM 4. An upper bound for the equilibrium number of partners to be considered over a search round is the solution of the equation: A(N) = c(N) (16) provided A(N − 1) > c(N − 1), where we denote, A(N) := Z ∞ y=0 yNf(y)Gk(y) N+k−2 k−1 dy. Proof: We denote: A(N, x) = Z ∞ y=x yNf(y)Gk(y) N+k−2 k−1 dy so that A(N) = A(N, 0). From Equation 7: VN (x) = A(N, x) − c(N) N R ∞ x f(y)Gk(y)bdy = A(N, x) − c(N) positive , Clearly A(N) ≥ A(N, x)∀x since the integrand is positive. Hence if A(N) − c(N) < 0, then A(N, x) − c(N) < 0∀x and VN (x) < 0 ∀x. Next we prove that if A(N)−c(N) gets negative, it stays negative. Recalling that for any g(y): d dN (g(y)b(N) ) = g(y)b(N) log(g(y)) db dN we get: A (N) = −1 (k − 1)2 Z ∞ 0 Gk(y) N k−1 (log Gk(y))2 dy which is always negative, since the integrand is nonnegative. Therefore A(N) is concave. Since c(N) is convex, −c(N) is concave, and a sum of concave functions is concave, we obtain that The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 455 A(N) − c(N) is concave. This guarantees that once the concave expression A(N) − c(N) shifts from a positive value to a negative one (with the increase in N), it cannot become positive again. Therefore, having N∗ such that A(N∗ ) = c(N∗ ), and A(N∗∗ ) > c(N∗∗ ) for some N∗∗ < N∗ , is an upper bound for N, i.e., VN (x) < 0 ∀N ≥ N∗ . The condition we specify for N∗∗ is merely for ensuring that VN is switching from a positive value to a negative one (and not vice versa) and is trivial to implement. Given the existence of the upper bound, we can design an algorithm for finding the equilibrium strategy (if one exists). The algorithm extracts the upper bound, ˆN, for the equilibrium number of parallel interactions according to Theorem 4. Out of the set of values satisfying the stability condition defined above, the algorithm chooses the one associated with the highest reservation value according to Equation 10. This is the equilibrium associated with the highest expected utility to all agents according to Theorem 2. 0.1875 0.39 0.41 0.43 0.45 0.47 0.49 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 expected utility VN(x) num ber ofparallelinteractions (N) VN+ 1 ( XN) VN( XN) VN-1 ( XN) enlarged Figure 2: The incentive to deviate from strategy (N, xN ) The process is illustrated in Figure 2 for an artificial environment where partnerships utilities are associated with a uniform distribution. The cost function used is c(N) = 0.2 + 0.02N. The graph depicts a single agents expected utility when all other agents are using N parallel interactions (on the horizontal axis) and the appropriate reservation value xN (calculated according to Equation 10).

According to the discussion following Theorem 3, a stable equilibrium satisfies: VN (xN ) > max{VN+1(xN ), VN−1(xN )}. The strategy satisfying the latter condition in our example is (9, 0.437). 4. RELATED WORK The two-sided economic search for partnerships in AI literature is a sub-domain of coalition formation8 . While coalition formation models usually consider general coalition-sizes [24], the partnership formation model (often referred as matchmaking) considers environments where agents have a benefit only when forming a partnership and this benefit can not be improved by extending the partnership to more than two agents [12, 23] (e.g., in the case of buyers and sellers or peer-to-peer applications). As in the general 8 The use of the term partnership in this context refers to the agreement between two individual agents to cooperate in a pre-defined manner. For example, in the buyer-seller application a partnership is defined as an agreed transaction between the two-parties [9]. coalition formation case, agents have the incentive to form partnerships when they are incapable of executing a task by their own or when the partnership can improve their individual utilities [14]. Various centralized matching mechanisms can be found in the literature [6, 2, 8]. However, in many MAS environments, in the absence of any reliable central matching mechanism, the matching process is completely distributed. While the search in agent-based environments is well recognized to be costly [11, 21, 1], most of the proposed coalition formation mechanisms assume that an agent can scan as many partnership opportunities in its environment as needed or have access to central matchers or middle agents [6]. The incorporation of costly search in this context is quite rare [21] and to the best of our knowledge, a distributed two-sided search for partners model similar to the S-DM model has not been studied to date. Classical economic search theory ([15, 17], and references therein) widely addresses the problem of a searcher operating in a costly environment, seeking to maximize his long term utility. In these models, classified as one-sided search, the focus is on establishing the optimal strategies for the searcher, assuming no mutual search activities (i.e., no influence on the environment). Here the sequential search procedure is often applied, allowing the searcher to investigate a single [15] or multiple [7, 19] opportunities at a time. While the latter method is proven to be beneficial for the searcher, it was never used in the two-sided search models that followed (where dual search activities are modeled) [22, 5, 18]. Therefore, in these models, the equilibrium strategies are always developed based on the assumption that the agents interact with others sequentially (i.e., with one agent at a time). A first attempt to integrate the parallel search into a two-sided search model is given in [21], as detailed in the introduction section. Several of the two-sided search essences can be found in the strategic theory of bargaining [3] - both coalition formation and matching can be represented as a sequential bargaining game [4] in which payoffs are defined as a function of the coalition structure and can be divided according to a fixed or negotiated division rule. Nevertheless, in the sequential bargaining literature, most emphasis is put on specifying the details of the sequential negotiating process over the division of the utility (or cost) jointly owned by parties or the strategy the coalition needs to adopt [20, 4]. The models presented in this area do not associate the coalition formation process with search costs, which is the essence of the analysis that economic search theory aims to supply. Furthermore, even in repeated pairwise bargaining [10] models the agents are always limited to initiating a single bargaining interaction at a time. 5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The phenomenal growth evidenced in recent years in the number of software agent-based applications, alongside the continuous improvement in agents processing and communication capabilities, suggest various incentives for agents to improve their search performance by applying advanced search strategies such as parallel search. The multiple-interactions technique is known to be beneficial for agents both in one-sided and two-sided economic search [7, 16, 21], since it allows the agents to decrease their average cost of learning about potential partnerships and their values. In this paper we propose a new parallel two-sided search mechanism that differs from the existing one in a sense that it allows the agents to delay their decision making process concerning the acceptance and rejection of potential partnerships as necessary. This, in comparison to the existing instantaneous model [21] which force each agent to make a simultaneous decision concerning each of the potential partnerships revealed to it during the current search stage. 456 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) As discussed throughout the paper, the new method is much more intuitive to the agent than the existing model - an agent will always prefer to keep all options available. Furthermore, as we prove in the former sections, an agents transition to the new search method always results with a better utility. As we prove in Section 2, in spite of the transition to a sequential decision making, deadlocks never occur in the proposed method as long as all agents use the proposed strategies. Since our analysis is equilibrium-based, a deviation from the proposed strategies is not beneficial. Similarly, we show that a deviation of a single agent (back) to the instantaneous decision making strategy is not beneficial. The only problem that may arise in the transition from an instantaneous to sequential decision making is when an agent fails (technically) to function (endlessly delaying the notification to the agents it interacted with). While equilibrium analysis normally do not consider malfunction as a legitimate strategy, we do wish to emphasize that the malfunctioning agent problem can be resolved by using a simple timeout for receiving responses and skipping this agent in the sequential decision process if the timeout is exceeded. Our analysis covers all aspects of the new two-sided search technique, from individual strategy construction throughout the dynamics that lead to stability (equilibrium). The difficulty in the extraction of the agents equilibrium strategies in the new model derives from the need to recursively model, while setting an agents strategy, the rejection other agents might face from other agents they interact with. This complexity (that does not exist in former models) is resolved by the introduction of the recursive function Gk(x) in Section 2. Using the different theorems and propositions we prove, we proffer efficient tools for calculating the agents equilibrium strategies. Our capabilities to produce an upper bound for the number of parallel interactions used in equilibrium (Theorem 4) and to quickly identify (and eliminate) non-equilibrium strategies (Theorem 3) resolves the problem of the computational complexity associated with having to deal with a theoretically infinite strategy space. While the analysis we present is given in the context of software agents, the model we suggest is general, and can be applied to any two-sided economic search environment where the searchers can search in parallel. In particular, in addition to weakly dominating the instantaneous decision making model (as we prove in the analysis section) the proposed method weakly dominates the purely sequential two-sided search model (where each agent interacts with only one other agent at a time) [5]. This derives from the fact that the proposed method is a generalization of the latter (i.e., in the worst case scenario, the agent can interact with one other agent at a time in parallel). Naturally the attempt to integrate search theory techniques into day-to-day applications brings up the applicability question. Justification and legitimacy considerations for this integration were discussed in the wide literature we refer to throughout the paper. The current paper is not focused on re-arguing applicability, but rather on the improvement of the the core two-sided search model. We see great importance in future research that will combine bargaining as part of the interaction process. We believe such research can result in many rich variants of our two-sided search model. 6.

INTRODUCCIÓN Una búsqueda económica de dos lados es un mecanismo distribuido para formar a los agentes asociaciones por pares [5] .1 En cada etapa del proceso, cada uno de los agentes se combina aleatoriamente con otro agente 1 Observe que el concepto de búsqueda aquí es muy diferente deLa definición clásica de búsqueda en AI. Si bien la búsqueda de IA es un proceso activo en el que un agente encuentra una secuencia de acciones que lo llevarán del estado inicial a un estado objetivo, la búsqueda económica se refiere a la identificación del mejor agente para comprometerse con una asociación.y los dos interactúan bilateralmente para aprender el beneficio encapsulado en una asociación entre ellos. La interacción no implica la negociación, por lo que cada agente simplemente necesita elegir entre aceptar o rechazar la asociación con el otro agente. Un mercado típico donde se lleva a cabo este tipo de búsqueda de dos lados es el mercado matrimonial [22]. La literatura reciente sugiere varias aplicaciones basadas en agentes de software donde se realiza una búsqueda distribuida de dos lados (es decir, sin mecanismos de coincidencia centralizados). Una clase importante de tales aplicaciones incluye mercados secundarios para intercambiar recursos no explotados. Se utiliza un mecanismo de intercambio en aquellos casos en los que vender estos recursos no es el negocio principal de la organización o cuando la sobrecarga para venderlos lo hace no beneficioso. Por ejemplo, a través de una búsqueda predominante, los agentes, que representan diferentes proveedores de servicios, pueden intercambiar el ancho de banda no utilizado [21] y los satélites de comunicación pueden transferir la comunicación con una mayor cobertura geográfica. La búsqueda basada en agentes twosed también se puede encontrar en aplicaciones de compradores y vendedores en emarkets y aplicaciones de igual a igual. La naturaleza predominante de la búsqueda sugiere que una asociación entre un par de agentes se forma solo si se acepta mutuamente. Al formar una asociación, los agentes obtienen una utilidad inmediata y terminan su búsqueda. Al reanudar la búsqueda, por otro lado, se puede encontrar un socio más adecuado, sin embargo, deberán consumirse algunos recursos para mantener el proceso de búsqueda. En este artículo nos centramos en una clase específica de problemas de coincidencia de búsqueda de dos lados, en el que el rendimiento de la asociación se aplica a ambas partes, es decir, ambos obtienen una utilidad igual [13]. El escenario de igual utilidad generalmente es aplicable en dominios donde los socios ganan de la sinergia entre ellos. Por ejemplo, considere los jugadores de tenis que buscan socios cuando jueguen dobles (o un remero de canoes que busca un compañero para practicar). Aquí los jugadores están siendo recompensados por completo en función del rendimiento de los equipos (en lugar del individuo). Otros ejemplos son el escenario en el que los estudiantes necesitan formar pares para trabajar juntos en una tarea, para los cuales ambos socios comparten la misma calificación, y el escenario en el que dos agentes compradores interesados en productos similares o intercambiables unen fuerzas para comprar un producto, aprovechando.de descuento por cantidad (es decir, cada uno de ellos disfruta del mismo precio reducido). En todas estas aplicaciones, dos agentes pueden formar una asociación y el desempeño de cualquier asociación dada depende de las habilidades o las características de sus miembros. Además, el escenario de igual utilidad también puede mantener siempre que haya una opción para pagos al margen y la utilidad general de las asociaciones se divide igualmente entre los dos agentes que lo forman [22]. Si bien la literatura de búsqueda de dos lados ofrece un análisis de equilibrio integral para varios modelos, supone que la búsqueda de los agentes se realiza de manera puramente secuencial: cada agente se ubica e interactúa con otro agente en su entorno en un tiempo 450 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) C 2007 Ifaamas [5, 22]. Sin embargo, cuando la búsqueda se asigna a los agentes de software autónomos, se puede utilizar una mejor estrategia de búsqueda. Aquí, un agente puede aprovechar sus capacidades únicas de filtrado inherente y procesamiento de información y su capacidad de eficientemente (en comparación con las personas) mantener interacciones concurrentes con varios otros agentes en cada etapa de su búsqueda. Dicho uso de interacciones paralelas en la búsqueda es favorable cada vez que el costo promedio2 por interacción con otro agente, cuando interactúa en paralelo con un lote de otros agentes, es menor que el costo de mantener una interacción a la vez (es decir, ventaja de tamaño). Por ejemplo, el análisis de los costos asociados con la evaluación de posibles asociaciones entre los proveedores de servicios revela componentes fijos y variables cuando se utilizan la búsqueda paralela, por lo que el costo promedio por interacción disminuye a medida que aumenta el número de interacciones paralelas [21]. A pesar de las ventajas identificadas para las interacciones paralelas en dominios adyacentes (por ejemplo, en la búsqueda económica unilateral [7, 16]), un primer intento de modelar un proceso de coincidencia de parejas repetido en el que los agentes son capaces de mantener la interacción con otros agentes en unEl tiempo se introdujo recientemente [21]. Sin embargo, los agentes en ese modelo seminal deben sincronizar su proceso de toma de decisiones. Por lo tanto, cada agente, al revisar las oportunidades disponibles en una etapa de búsqueda específica, debe notificar a todos los demás agentes de su decisión si comprometerse con una asociación (como máximo con uno de ellos) o rechazar la asociación (con el resto de ellos). Esta restricción inherente impone una limitación significativa en el comportamiento estratégico de los agentes. En nuestro modelo, los agentes son libres de notificar a los otros agentes de sus decisiones de manera asincrónica. El enfoque asincrónico permite a los agentes reevaluar su estrategia, en función de cada nueva respuesta que reciben de los agentes con los que interactúan. Esto lleva a un proceso de toma de decisiones secuencial por el cual cada agente, al enviar un mensaje de confirmación a uno de los otros agentes, retrasa su decisión con respecto a un compromiso o rechazo de todas las demás asociaciones potenciales hasta recibir una respuesta de ese agente (es decir, el agente, el agente, el agenteTodavía mantiene interacciones paralelas en cada etapa de búsqueda, excepto que su proceso de toma de decisiones al final de la etapa es secuencial en lugar de instantáneo). El nuevo modelo es un modelo por pares mucho más realista y, como mostramos en la sección de análisis, siempre es preferido por cualquier agente que participe en el proceso. En ausencia de otros modelos económicos de búsqueda paralela de dos lados, utilizamos el modelo que se basa en un proceso instantáneo (sincrónico) de toma de decisiones [21] (denotado I-DM en todo el resto del documento) como un punto de referencia para evaluar la utilidadde nuestra estrategia de toma de decisiones secuencial (asíncrona) propuesta (denotada S-DM). Las principales contribuciones de este documento son triples: primero, modelamos formalmente y analizamos un proceso de búsqueda de dos lados en el que los agentes no tienen restricciones de toma de decisiones temporales con respecto al rechazo o compromiso con posibles asociaciones que encuentran en paralelo (el S-DMmodelo). Este modelo es un modelo de búsqueda general que se puede aplicar en varios dominios (no necesariamente de los agentes basados en el software). En segundo lugar, demostramos que la estrategia de SDM de los agentes domina débilmente la estrategia I-DM, por lo tanto, cada agente tiene un incentivo para desviarse a la estrategia S-DM cuando todos los demás agentes están utilizando la estrategia I-DM. Finalmente, al utilizar una presentación recursiva innovadora de las probabilidades de aceptación de diferentes asociaciones potenciales, identificamos características únicas de las estrategias de equilibrio en el nuevo modelo. Estos se utilizan para suministrar un medio computacional apropiado que facilita el cálculo de la estrategia de equilibrio de los agentes. Esta última contribución es 2, el término costos se refiere a los recursos que el agente necesita para consumir para mantener su búsqueda, como: auto anuncio, localización de otros agentes, comunicarse con ellos y procesar sus ofertas.De especial importancia ya que la transición al modo asincrónico agrega complejidad inherente al modelo (principalmente porque ahora cada agente necesita evaluar las probabilidades de que cada agente sea rechazado o aceptado por cada uno de los otros agentes con los que interactúa, en un múltipleProceso secuencial de etapa). Logramos extraer las nuevas estrategias de equilibrio de los agentes sin aumentar la complejidad computacional en comparación con el modelo I-DM. A lo largo del documento, demostramos las diferentes propiedades del nuevo modelo y lo comparamos con el modelo I-DM utilizando un entorno sintético artificial. En la siguiente sección presentamos formalmente el modelo S-DM. Un análisis de equilibrio y medios computacionales para encontrar la estrategia de equilibrio se proporcionan en la Sección 3. En la Sección 4 revisamos la literatura relacionada con la teoría de la búsqueda económica. Concluimos con una discusión y sugerimos instrucciones para futuras investigaciones en la Sección 5. 2. Modelo y análisis consideramos un entorno poblado con un número infinito de agentes totalmente racionales interesados de diferentes tipos3. Cualquier agente AI puede formar una asociación con cualquier otro agente AJ en el medio ambiente, asociado con una utilidad percibida inmediata U (AI, AJ) para ambos agentes. Como en muchos otros modelos de formación de asociación (ver [5, 21]), suponemos que el valor de u (x, y) (donde x e y son dos agentes en el entorno) se extrae aleatoriamente de una población continua caracterizada por unaFunción de distribución de probabilidad (P.D.F.) F (U) y una función de distribución acumulativa (C.D.F.) F (u), (0 ≤ u <∞). Se supone que los agentes conocen la función de distribución de servicios públicos F (x), sin embargo, no pueden decir a A-Priori qué utilidad puede obtener una asociación con cualquier agente específico en su entorno. Por lo tanto, la única forma en que un agente AI puede aprender el valor de una asociación con otro agente AJ, U (AI, AJ), es interactuar con el agente AJ. Dado que cada agente en modelos de búsqueda de dos lados no tiene información previa sobre ninguno de los otros agentes en su entorno, inicia interacciones (es decir, búsqueda) con otros agentes al azar. La naturaleza de la aplicación de búsqueda de dos lados sugiere que los agentes están satisfechos con tener un solo socio, por lo tanto, una vez que se forma una asociación, los dos agentes que lo forman terminan su proceso de búsqueda y abandonan el entorno. Los agentes no se limitan a interactuar con un solo agente asociado potencial a la vez, sino que pueden seleccionar interactuar con varios otros agentes en paralelo. Definimos una ronda/etapa de búsqueda como el intervalo en el que el agente interactúa con varios agentes en paralelo y aprende la utilidad de formar una asociación con cada uno de ellos. Según los valores aprendidos, el agente debe decidir si comprometer o rechazar cada una de las posibles asociaciones disponibles para él. El compromiso se logra enviando un mensaje de confirmación al agente apropiado y un agente no puede comprometerse con más de una posible asociación simultáneamente. La disminución de una asociación se logra enviando un mensaje de rechazo. Se supone que la comunicación entre los agentes es asincrónica y cada agente puede retrasar su decisión, con respecto a cualquier asociación potencial dada, según sea necesario.4 Si dos agentes AI y AJ se comprometen mutuamente a una asociación entre 3, el número de la suposición de agentes es común enModelos de búsqueda de dos lados (ver [5, 22, 21]). En muchos dominios (por ejemplo, comercio electrónico) esto deriva de la alta entrada y las tasas de dejar, por lo tanto, la probabilidad de llegar al mismo agente en una coincidencia aleatoria es insignificante.4 Observe que el procedimiento asincrónico no elimina la estructura inherente de la búsqueda. La búsqueda todavía se basa en etapas/rondas en las que en cada búsqueda alrededor del agente interactúa con varios otros agentes, excepto que ahora el agente puede retrasar su proceso de toma de decisiones (dentro de cada ronda de búsqueda) según sea necesario. El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 451 ellos, luego se forma la asociación y ambos agentes obtienen la utilidad inmediata U (AI, AJ) asociada con ella. Si un agente no forma una asociación en una etapa de búsqueda dada, continúa a su próxima etapa de búsqueda e interactúa con más agentes de manera similar. Dada la opción para la toma de decisiones asincrónicas, cada agente individual, IA, sigue el siguiente procedimiento: 1: bucle 2: establecer n (número de interacciones paralelas para la siguiente ronda de búsqueda) 3: localizar aleatoriamente un conjunto a = {a1 ,..., Un} de agentes para interactuar con 4: evaluar el conjunto de utilidades {u (ai, a1) ,..., U (ai, an)} 5: establecer a ∗ = {aj | aj ∈A y u (ai, aj)> u (currículum)} 6: Envíe un mensaje de rechazo a cada agente en el conjunto {a \\ a ∗} 7: mientras (a ∗ = ∅) do 8: envíe un mensaje de confirmación a AJ = argmaxal∈A ∗ u (ai, al) 9: elimine aJ de a ∗ 10: espere a AJS decisión 11: if (aj respondió comandante) luego 12: Envíe mensajes de rechazo a los agentes restantes en un ∗ 13: Terminar la búsqueda 14: Fin si 15: Fin mientras 16: Fin Loop donde U (reanudación) denota la utilidad esperada de continuar la búsqueda (en los siguientes párrafos que mostramosque U (currículum) se fija en toda la búsqueda y se deriva de la estrategia de los agentes). En el algoritmo anterior, cualquier agente AI identifica primero el conjunto A ∗ de otros agentes que está dispuesto a aceptar de los revisados en la etapa de búsqueda actual y envía un mensaje de rechazo al resto. Luego envía un mensaje de confirmación al agente aj ∈ A ∗ que está asociado con la asociación que produce la utilidad más alta. Si se recibió un mensaje de rechazo del Agente AJ, este agente se elimina de un ∗ y se envía un nuevo mensaje de confirmación de acuerdo con los mismos criterios. El proceso continúa hasta que: (a) el conjunto A ∗ se vacía, en cuyo caso el agente inicia otra etapa de búsqueda;o (b) se obtiene un compromiso dual, en cuyo caso el agente envía mensajes de rechazo a los agentes restantes en un ∗. El método difiere del utilizado en el modelo I-DM en la forma en que maneja los mensajes de compromiso: en el modelo I-DM, después de evaluar el conjunto de utilidades (Paso 4), el agente simplemente envía instantáneamente un mensaje de confirmación alAgente asociado con la mayor utilidad y un mensaje de rechazo a todos los demás agentes con los que interactuó (como reemplazo a los pasos 5-15 en el procedimiento anterior). Nuestro modelo S-DM propuesto es mucho más intuitivo, ya que permite que un agente sostenga y posiblemente explote oportunidades relativamente beneficiosas, incluso si el otro agente rechaza su primera asociación prioritaria. En el modelo I-DM, por otro lado, ya que los mensajes de rechazo se envían junto con el mensaje de confirmación, simultáneamente, un mensaje de rechazo del agente asociado con la mejor asociación aplica una nueva ronda de búsqueda. Observe que el mecanismo de búsqueda de dos lados anterior se alinea con la mayoría de los otros mecanismos de búsqueda de dos lados en el sentido de que se basa en la coincidencia aleatoria (es decir, en cada búsqueda alrededor del agente encuentra una muestra aleatoria de agentes). Si bien el mantenimiento de la infraestructura de correspondencia aleatoria es una pregunta de investigación interesante, está más allá del alcance de este documento. No obstante, deseamos enfatizar que dada la gran cantidad de agentes en el medio ambiente y el hecho de que en MAS la tasa de rotación es bastante sustancial debido a la naturaleza abierta del entorno (y la interoperabilidad entre entornos). Por lo tanto, la probabilidad de terminar interactuando con el mismo agente más de una vez, al iniciar una interacción aleatoria, es prácticamente insignificante. Teorema 1. El proceso de toma de decisiones de los agentes S-DM: (a) es el óptimo (maximiza la utilidad) para cualquier agente individual en el entorno;y (b) garantiza una probabilidad de bloqueo cero para cualquier agente dado en el medio ambiente. Prueba: (a) El método es óptimo ya que no se puede cambiar de una manera que produzca una mejor utilidad para el agente. Dado que la negociación no es aplicable aquí (los beneficios no son divisibles), la estrategia de los agentes se limita a aceptar o rechazar ofertas. La decisión de rechazar una asociación en el Paso 6 se basa solo en la utilidad inmediata que se puede obtener de esta asociación en comparación con la utilidad esperada de reanudar la búsqueda (es decir, pasar a la siguiente etapa de búsqueda) y no se ve afectado por elLa voluntad de los otros agentes para cometer o rechazar una asociación con la IA. En cuanto a las asociaciones que producen una utilidad mayor que la utilidad esperada de reanudar la búsqueda (es decir, las asociaciones con agentes del conjunto A ∗), el agente siempre prefiere retrasar su decisión con respecto a las asociaciones de este tipo hasta recibir todas las notificaciones sobre posibles asociacionesque están asociados con una mayor utilidad inmediata. La demora nunca resulta con una pérdida de oportunidad, ya que la decisión de los otros agentes con respecto a esta oportunidad no se ve afectada por la voluntad del agente de comprometer o rechazar esta oportunidad (sino por la estimación de los otros agentes de su utilidad esperada si reanudan la búsqueda y los mensajes de rechazoRecibe por asociaciones potenciales más beneficiosas). Finalmente, el agente no puede beneficiarse de retrasar un mensaje de confirmación al agente asociado con la utilidad más alta en un ∗, por lo que siempre le enviará un mensaje de confirmación.(b) Primero probamos el siguiente lema que establece que la probabilidad de tener dos oportunidades de asociación asociadas con una utilidad idéntica es cero. Lema 2.1. Cuando F es una función de distribución continua, entonces lim y → x »z y z = x f (z) dz -2!= 0. Prueba: Dado que F es continuo y el intervalo entre x e y es finito, por el teorema del valor intermedio (que se encuentra en la mayoría de los textos de cálculo) existe una c entre x e y thatz y z = x f (z) dz = f (c) (y (y- x) (Intuitivamente, un rectángulo con la base de z = x a z = y y la altura = f (c) tiene la misma área que la integral en el lado izquierdo). Por lo tanto, »z y z = x f (z) dz -2 = | f (c) | 2 | y -x | 2 cuando y → x, f (c) permanece limitado debido a la continuidad de f, además limy → x f (c)= f (x), de ahí lim y → x »z y z = x f (z) dz -2!= f (x) 2 lim y → x | y - x | 2 = 0 .. Un derivado inmediato del lema anterior es que no se requieren procedimientos de rota de unión y un agente en un estado de espera siempre está esperando una respuesta del agente único asociado con la utilidad más alta entre los agentes en el conjunto A ∗ (es decir, no.Otro agente en el conjunto A ∗ está asociado con una utilidad igual). Un punto muerto solo se puede formar si podemos crear una secuencia cíclica de agentes en el que cualquier agente esté esperando una respuesta del agente posterior en la secuencia. Sin embargo, en nuestro método, cualquier agente AI estará esperando una respuesta de otro agente AJ, al que envió un mensaje de confirmación, solo si: (1) cualquier agente ak ∈ A, asociado con una utilidad u (ai, ak)>U (AI, AJ), ya ha rechazado la asociación con el Agente AI;y (2) el agente AJ en sí está esperando una respuesta del Agente Al donde U (Al, AJ)> U (AJ, AI). Por lo tanto, si tenemos una secuencia de agentes de espera, la utilidad asociada con asociaciones entre dos agentes posteriores en la secuencia debe aumentar a lo largo de la secuencia. Si la secuencia es cíclica, entonces tenemos un 452 el sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) Patrón de la forma: U (Ai, Al)> U (Al, AJ)> U (AJ, AI). Desde u (ai, al)> u (AJ, ai), el agente ai puede estar esperando el agente aj solo si ya ha sido rechazado por al (ver (1) arriba). Sin embargo, si el Agente AL ha rechazado el Agente AI, también ha rechazado el Agente AJ. Por lo tanto, el Agente AJ no puede estar esperando que el Agente AL tome una decisión. La misma lógica se puede aplicar a una secuencia más larga.2 Se supone que la actividad de búsqueda es costosa [11, 1, 16] de una manera que cualquier agente necesita consumir algunos de sus recursos para localizar a otros agentes para interactuar y mantener las interacciones ellos mismos. Suponemos que los servicios públicos y los costos son aditivos y que los agentes están tratando de maximizar su utilidad general, definida como la utilidad de la asociación formada menos los costos de búsqueda agregados a lo largo del proceso de búsqueda. El costo de los agentes de interactuar con N otros agentes (en paralelo) viene dado por la función C (n). La estructura de costos de búsqueda es principalmente un parámetro del entorno y, por lo tanto, compartido por todos los agentes. Una estrategia de agentes s (a) → {cometer aj ∈ A, rechazar a ⊂ a, n} define para cualquier conjunto de oportunidades de asociación, a, ¿cuál es el subconjunto de oportunidades que deberían rechazarse inmediatamente, a qué agente enviar unMensaje de confirmación (si no se espera una notificación pendiente de otro agente) o el número de nuevas interacciones para iniciar (n). Dado que el proceso de búsqueda es de dos lados, nuestro objetivo es encontrar un conjunto de estrategias de equilibrio para los agentes.2.1 La estructura de la estrategia recuerda que cada agente rechazó las asociaciones en función de (a) la utilidad inmediata de las asociaciones en comparación con la utilidad esperada de los agentes que reanudan la búsqueda;y (b) lograr un compromiso mutuo (disminuyendo así las asociaciones pendientes que no fueron rechazadas en (a)). Por lo tanto, una estrategia de agentes puede estar representada por un par (NT, XT) donde NT es el número de agentes con los que elige interactuar en la etapa de búsqueda T y XT es su valor de reserva5 (un umbral) para aceptar/rechazar el potencial resultante N resultanteasociaciones. El subconjunto a ∗, por lo tanto, incluirá todas las oportunidades de asociación de la etapa de búsqueda T que están asociadas con una utilidad igual o mayor que XT. El valor de reserva XT es en realidad la utilidad esperada para reanudar la búsqueda en el momento t (es decir, U (reanudación)). El agente siempre preferirá comprometerse con una oportunidad mayor que la utilidad esperada de reanudar la búsqueda y siempre preferirá reanudar la búsqueda de otra manera. Dado que los agentes no están limitados por un horizonte de decisiones, y su proceso de búsqueda no implica ninguna información nueva sobre la estructura del mercado (por ejemplo, sobre la distribución de servicios públicos de oportunidades de asociación futura), su estrategia es estacionada: un agente no aceptará una oportunidadHa rechazado de antemano (es decir, x1 = x2 = ... = x) y usará el mismo tamaño de muestra, n1 = n2 = ... = n, a lo largo de su búsqueda.2.2 Cálculo de probabilidades de aceptación La transición del proceso de toma de decisiones instantáneas a uno secuencial Introduce varias dificultades nuevas para extraer las estrategias de los agentes. Ahora, para estimar la probabilidad de ser aceptado por cualquiera de los otros agentes, el agente necesita modelar recursivamente, mientras establece su estrategia, las probabilidades de rechazos que otros agentes podrían enfrentar de otros agentes con los que interactúan. En los siguientes párrafos presentamos varias definiciones y anotaciones complementarias, facilitando la introducción formal de las probabilidades de aceptación. Considere una AI del Agente, utilizando una estrategia (N, XN) mientras opera en un entorno donde todos los demás agentes 5 Noten el valor de reserva utilizado aquí es diferente de un concepto de precio de reserva (que generalmente se usa como evaluación privada de compradores). El uso de estrategias basadas en el valor de reserva es común en los modelos de búsqueda económica [21, 17].están utilizando una estrategia (K, XK). La probabilidad de que el Agente AI reciba un mensaje de compromiso del Agente AJ con el que interactuó depende de la utilidad asociada con la posible asociación entre ellos, x. Esta probabilidad, denotada por GK (x) se puede calcular como: 6 GK (x) = 8> <>: „1 - z ∞ y = x f (y) gk (y) dy« k - 1 si x ≥ xk 0de lo contrario.(1) El caso donde x <xk anterior es trivial: ninguno de los otros agentes aceptará el agente ai si la utilidad en dicha asociación es menor que su valor de reserva XK. Sin embargo, incluso cuando la utilidad de las asociaciones es mayor o igual a XK, el compromiso no está garantizado. En el último escenario, se recibirá un mensaje de compromiso del Agente AJ solo si el Agente AJ ha sido rechazado por todos los demás agentes en su conjunto A ∗ que se asociaron con una utilidad mayor que la utilidad de una asociación con el Agente AI. La solución única a la ecuación recursiva 1 es: gk (x) = 8 >>>>> <>>>>>: 1+ (k - 2) r ∞ y = xf (y) dy 1 - k k - 2,k> 2, x≥xk, exp ( - r ∞ y = x f (y) dy), k = 2, x≥xk, 1, k = 1, x≥xk 0, x <xk.(2) Observe que, como se esperaba, una oportunidad de asociación que produce la utilidad mutua máxima es necesariamente aceptada por ambos agentes, es decir, limx → ∞ gk (x) = 1. Por otro lado, cuando la utilidad asociada con una oportunidad potencial de asociación es cero (x = 0), la probabilidad de aceptación no es desplegable: LIM X → 0 GK (x) = (K-1) 1-K K-2 (3) Este resultado no intuitivo se deriva del hecho de que todavía existe una probabilidad no desplegable de que el otro agente sea rechazado por todos los demás agentes con los que interactúa.2.3 Configuración de las estrategias de los agentes utilizando la función GK (x), ahora podemos formular y explorar la utilidad esperada de los agentes al usar sus estrategias de búsqueda. Considere nuevamente una IA del agente que está utilizando una muestra de tamaño N, mientras que todos los demás agentes están utilizando una estrategia (K, XK). Denotamos por RN (x) la probabilidad de que la utilidad máxima de que el agente AI se pueda garantizar al interactuar con los agentes n (es decir, la utilidad más alta a la que se recibirá un mensaje de confirmación) es como máximo x. Esto se puede calcular como la probabilidad de que ninguno de los n agentes envíe un mensaje de Conjunto para una asociación asociada con una utilidad mayor que x: rn (x) = 1 - z ∞ max (x, xk) f (y) gk (y) Dy n (4) Observe que Rn (x) es de hecho una función de distribución acumulativa, satisfactoria: limx → ∞ rn (x) = 1 y drn (x)/dx> 0 (la función nunca obtiene un valor cero simplementePorque siempre existe una probabilidad positiva de que ninguno de los agentes se comprometa con una asociación con el Agente AI). Por lo tanto, la derivada de la función Rn (x), denotada RN (x), es, de hecho, la función de distribución de probabilidad de la utilidad máxima que se puede garantizar para el agente ai al muestrear n otros agentes: rn (x) = drn (x) dx = 8 <: nf (x) gk (x) n+k - 2 k - 1, x ≥ xk 0, x <xk (5) 6 El uso de la ecuación recursiva 1 está habilitado ya que suponemos que el númerode los agentes es infinito (por lo tanto, la probabilidad de tener una superposición entre los agentes que interactúan y el efecto de tal superposición en las probabilidades que calculamos se vuelve insignificante). El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 453 Esta función RN (x) es esencial para calcular VN (XN), la utilidad esperada de la IA del agente cuando se usa una estrategia (n, xn), dada la estrategia (k, (k,xk) utilizado por los otros agentes: vn (xn) = z ∞ y = max (xn, xk) yrn (y) dy+ 1− z ∞ y = max (xn, xk) rn (y) dy vn (xn) −C (n) (6) El lado derecho de la ecuación anterior representa la utilidad esperada de la IA del agente para tomar una etapa de búsqueda adicional. El primer término representa la utilidad esperada de los escenarios de compromiso mutuo, mientras que el segundo término es la utilidad esperada asociada con la reanudación de la búsqueda (que es igual a VN (XN) ya que nada ha cambiado para el agente). Usando manipulaciones matemáticas simples y sustituyendo Rn (x), la ecuación 6 se transforma en: vn (x) = r ∞ y = max (x, xk) ynf (y) gk (y) n+k - 2 k - 1 dy - c - c(N) r ∞ y = max (x, xk) nf (y) gk (y) n +k - 2 k - 1 dy (7) y simplificado aún más en: vn (x) = max (x, xk) + +Z ∞ max (x, xk) (1 - gk (y) n k - 1) dy - c (n) 1 - gk (max (x, xk)) n k - 1 (8) ecuación 8, nos permiteDemuestre algunas características importantes del modelo como se resume en el siguiente teorema 2. Teorema 2. Cuando otros agentes usan la estrategia (k, xk): (a) una función de utilidad esperada de los agentes, vn (xn), cuando se usa una estrategia (n, x), es cuasi cóncava en x con un máximo único, obtenido para el valor xnSatisfactorio: vn (xn) = xn (9) (b) El valor xn satisface: c (n) = `max (xn, xk) - xn ´` 1 - gk (xk) n k - 1 ´ + + z ∞Máx (xn, xk) (1 - gk (y) n k - 1) dy (10) La prueba se obtiene derivando vn (xn) en la ecuación 8 y estableciéndola en cero. Después de aplicar más manipulaciones matemáticas, obtenemos (9) y (10). Ambas partes del Teorema 2 pueden usarse como un medio eficiente para extraer el valor de reserva óptimo Xn de un agente, dadas las estrategias de los otros agentes en el entorno y el número de interacciones paralelas que utiliza. Además, en el caso de funciones de distribución complejas donde la extracción de Xn de la Ecuación 10 no es inmediato, se puede construir un algoritmo simple (principalmente basado en la búsqueda binaria) para calcular el valor de reserva óptimo de los agentes (lo que equivale a su utilidad esperada, según 9), con una complejidad o (log (ˆx ρ)), donde ρ es el nivel de precisión requerido para xn y ˆx es la solución a: r ∞ y = ˆx ynf (y) f (y) n - 1 dy = c (n)). Teniendo la capacidad de calcular XN, ahora podemos probar la siguiente proposición 2.1. Proposición 2.1. Un agente que opera en un entorno donde todos los agentes están utilizando una estrategia de acuerdo con el equilibrio de búsqueda paralelo instantáneo (es decir, de acuerdo con el modelo I-DM [21]) solo puede beneficiarse al desviarse a la estrategia S-DM propuesta. Boceto de prueba: para el modelo I-DM, el siguiente contiene [21]: c (n) = n 2n-1 z ∞ y = xi-dm n (1-f (y) 2n-1) dy (11) nosotrosAplique la metodología utilizada anteriormente en esta subsección para construir la utilidad esperada del agente utilizando la estrategia S-DM en función de su valor de reserva, suponiendo que todos los demás agentes están utilizando la estrategia de búsqueda I-DM. Esto resulta con un valor de reserva óptimo para el agente que usa S-DM, satisfaciendo: c (n) = z ∞ y = xs-dm n (1-(1-1 n + f (y) n n) n) dy (12) Finalmente, demostramos que el integrando en la ecuación 11 es más pequeño que el integrando en la ecuación 12. Dado el hecho de que ambos términos equivalen a C (n), obtenemos XS - DM N> XI -DM N y, en consecuencia, (según el teorema 2) una relación similar en términos de utilidades esperadas. La Figura 1 ilustra la superioridad de la estrategia de búsqueda propuesta S-DM, así como las características de las funciones de utilidad esperadas (como se refleja en el Teorema 2). Por razones comparativas, usamos el mismo entorno sintético que se utilizó para el modelo I-DM [21]. Aquí se supone que las utilidades se extraen de una función de distribución uniforme y se consideró que la función de costo era C (n) = 0.05 + 0.005N. El agente está usando n = 3 mientras que otros agentes están usando k = 25 y xk = 0.2. Las diferentes curvas representan la utilidad esperada del agente en función del valor de reserva, x, que usa, cuándo: (a) todos los agentes están utilizando la estrategia I-DM (marcada como I-DM);(b) el agente está utilizando la estrategia S-DM mientras que los otros agentes están utilizando la estrategia I-DM (marcada como I-DM/SDM);y (c) todos los agentes están utilizando la estrategia S-DM (marcada como S-DM). Como se esperaba, según la Ecuación 8 y el Teorema 2, la utilidad esperada de los agentes permanece constante hasta que su valor de reserva excede XK. Luego, alcanza un máximo global cuando el valor de reserva satisface VN (x) = x. Desde el gráfico podemos ver que el agente siempre tiene un incentivo para desviarse de la estrategia I-DM a la estrategia S-DM (como se demostró en la Proposición 2.1).0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Valor de reserva (x) Utilidad esperada VN (x) S-D m I-D M I-D M / S-D M Figura 1: La utilidad esperada en función del valor de reserva utilizado porel agente 3. Dinámica de equilibrio Dado que todos los agentes están sujetos a costos de búsqueda similares, y sus utilidades percibidas se extraen de la misma función de distribución, todos comparten la misma estrategia en equilibrio. Sin embargo, puede ocurrir un escenario multitilibrios, como discutimos en los siguientes párrafos, ya que todos los agentes comparten las mismas preferencias/prioridades (a diferencia de, por ejemplo, en el famoso escenario de batalla de los sexos), siempre podemos identificar qué estrategia de equilibrio se utilizará. Observe que si todos los agentes están utilizando el mismo tamaño de muestra, N, entonces el valor Xn resultante de resolver la ecuación 10 sustituyendo k = n y xk = xn es un valor de reserva estable (es decir, ninguno de los agentes puede beneficiarse de cambiar solo el solovalor de xn). Se puede encontrar una estrategia de equilibrio (n, xn) identificando un valor de n para el cual ningún agente único tiene un incentivo para usar un número diferente de interacciones paralelas, K (y la nueva reserva óptima 454 la sexta intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) valor que está asociado con K según la ecuación 10). Si bien esto implica un espacio de solución infinito, siempre podemos vincularlo usando las ecuaciones 8 y 10. Dentro del marco de este documento, demostramos que tal metodología delimitador para el caso común fue C (n) es lineal7 o convexo, utilizando el siguiente teorema 3. Teorema 3. Cuando C (N) es lineal (o convexo), entonces: (a) Cuando todos los demás agentes muestran K socios potenciales en una ronda de búsqueda, si los agentes esperaban la utilidad de los socios potenciales de muestreo K+1, VK+1 (XK+1), es más pequeño que VK (xk), entonces la utilidad esperada al muestrear n socios potenciales, vn (xn), donde n> k+1, también es más pequeño que VK (xk).(b) Del mismo modo, cuando todos los demás agentes muestran K socios potenciales en una ronda de búsqueda, si los agentes esperaban la utilidad de usar K - 1 Potencial Socios, VK - 1 (XK - 1), es menor que la utilidad esperada cuando se usa K potencialPartners, VK (XK), entonces la utilidad esperada cuando se usa n socios potenciales, donde n <k - 1, también es más pequeño que VK (XK). Prueba: usemos la notación CI para C (i). Dado que vk (xk) = xk ∀k (según la ecuación 9), las afirmaciones son: (a) si xk + 1 <xk entonces xn <xk para todos n ≥ k + 1, y (b) si xk - 1 <<xk luego xn <xk para todos n ≤ k - 1. (a) Comenzamos demostrando que si xk+1 <xk entonces xk+2 <xk. Suponga lo contrario, es decir, xk+1 <xk y xk+2> xk. Por lo tanto, según la ecuación 10, lo siguiente es: 0 <ck+2 - 2ck+1+ck <z ∞ xk+2 (1 - gk (y) k+2 k - 1) dy - 2 z ∞ xk (1- GK (Y) K + 1 K - 1) Dy + Z ∞ XK (1 - GK (y) K K - 1) DY donde la transición a la desigualdad es válida ya que C (i) es convexa. Dado que la suposición en esta prueba es que xk+2> xk, entonces lo anterior se puede transformar en: z ∞ xk 2gk (y) k+1 k - 1 - gk (y) k+2 k - 1 - gk (y)k k - 1 dy> 0 (13) Ahora observe que el término integrado es en realidad −gk (y) k k - 1 `1- gk (y) 1 k - 1 ´2 que obviamente es negativo, contradiciendo el supuesto inicial, por lo tanto, sixk+1 <xk entonces necesariamente xk+2 <xk. Ahora necesitamos demostrar lo mismo para cualquier XK+J. Lo demostraremos en dos pasos: primero, si xk+i <xk entonces xk+2i <xk. Segundo, si xk+i <xk y xk+i+1 <xk, entonces xk+2i+1 <xk. Juntos, estos constituyen los argumentos de inducción necesarios para probar el caso (a). Comenzamos con el caso uniforme, utilizando una metodología similar: asumir lo contrario, es decir, xk+l <xk ∀l = 1, ..., j - 1 y xk+2i> xk. Según la Ecuación 10, y el hecho de que C (i) es convexo, lo siguiente es: Z ∞ XK 2GK (Y) K+I K - 1 - GK (Y) K+2I K - 1 - GK (Y) K K−1 dy> 0 (14) y nuevamente el integrando es en realidad −gk (y) k k - 1 `1 - gk (y) i k - 1 ´2, que obviamente es negativo, contradiciendo la suposición inicial, por lo tanto, xk+2i <xk. En cuanto al caso impar, usamos la ecuación 10 una vez para interacciones paralelas K + i + 1 y una vez para K + 2i + 1. De la convexidad de Ci, obtenemos: Ck+2i+1 - Ck+I - Ck+I+1+Ck> 0, por lo tanto: Z ∞ XK `GK (Y) K+I K - 1+GK (Y) K+i+1 k-1 −gk (y) k+2i+1 k-1 −gk (y) k k-1 ´ dy> 0 (15) 7 Una función de costo lineal es principalmente común en dos lados basados en agentesAplicaciones de búsqueda, ya que a menudo la función de costo se puede dividir en costos fijos (por ejemplo, operar el agente por unidad de tiempo) y los costos variables (es decir, el costo de procesar un solo datos de interacciones). Esta vez, el término integrado en la ecuación 15 puede reescribirse como gk (y) k k-1 (1-gk (y) i k-1) (gk (y) i+1 k-1-1) que obviamente es negativo, contradiciendo la suposición inicial, por lo tanto xk+i+1 <xk. Ahora, usando inducción, uno puede probar que si xk+1 <xk entonces xk+i <xk. Esto concluye la parte (a) de la prueba. La prueba de la parte (b) del teorema se obtiene de manera similar. En este caso: ck - 2ck - i + ck - 2i> 0 y ck - ck - i - 1 - ck - i + ck - 2i - 1> 0. El teorema anterior nos proporciona una herramienta poderosa para eliminar los valores de N sin equilibrio. Sugiere que podemos verificar la estabilidad de un tamaño de muestra n y el valor de reserva apropiado Xn simplemente calculando los valores de reserva óptimos de un solo agente al desviarnos hacia el uso de muestras de tamaños n - 1 y n + 1 (manteniendo a los otros agentes conestrategia (n, xn)). Si ambos los valores de reserva apropiados asociados con los dos últimos tamaños de muestra son más pequeños que Xn, entonces, según los teoremas 3, lo mismo se mantiene al desviarse a cualquier otro tamaño de muestra k.El proceso anterior se puede simplificar aún más utilizando VN+1 (xn)> Xn y Vn - 1 (xn)> xn como las dos reglas de eliminación. Esto deriva del teorema 3 y las propiedades de la función VN (x) que se encuentra en el Teorema 2. Observe que puede ocurrir un escenario de equipos múltiples, sin embargo, se puede resolver fácilmente. Si varias estrategias satisfacen la condición de estabilidad definida anteriormente, los agentes siempre preferirán la asociada con la utilidad más alta esperada. Por lo tanto, se puede aplicar un algoritmo que repasa los diferentes valores de N y los verifica de acuerdo con las reglas anteriores, suponiendo que podamos vincular el intervalo para buscar el equilibrio N. El siguiente teorema 4 sugiere tal límite superior. Teorema 4. Un límite superior para el número de equilibrio de socios a considerar en una ronda de búsqueda es la solución de la ecuación: a (n) = c (n) (16) proporcionó a (n - 1)> c (n - 1),donde denotamos, a (n): = z ∞ y = 0 ynf (y) gk (y) n+k - 2 k - 1 dy. Prueba: denotamos: a (n, x) = z ∞ y = x ynf (y) gk (y) n+k - 2 k - 1 dy para que a (n) = a (n, 0). De la ecuación 7: vn (x) = a (n, x) - c (n) n r ∞ x f (y) gk (y) bdy = a (n, x) - c (n) positivo, claramente a (n)≥ a (n, x) ∀x ya que el integrando es positivo. Por lo tanto, si a (n) - c (n) <0, entonces a (n, x) - c (n) <0∀x y vn (x) <0 ∀x. A continuación, demostramos que si A (N) −C (N) se vuelve negativo, se mantiene negativo. Recordando que para cualquier g (y): d dn (g (y) b (n)) = g (y) b (n) log (g (y)) db dn obtenemos: a (n) = −1 (k - 1) 2 z ∞ 0 gk (y) n k - 1 (log gk (y)) 2 dy que siempre es negativo, ya que el integrando no es negativo. Por lo tanto, un (n) es cóncavo. Dado que c (n) es convexo, −c (n) es cóncavo y una suma de funciones cóncavas es cóncava, obtenemos que el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 455 A (N)-C (N) es cóncavo. Esto garantiza que una vez que la expresión cóncava a (n) - c (n) cambia de un valor positivo a uno negativo (con el aumento en n), no puede volver a ser positivo nuevamente. Por lo tanto, tener n ∗ tal que a (n ∗) = c (n ∗), y a (n ∗∗)> c (n ∗∗) para algunos n ∗∗ <n ∗, es un límite superior para n, i.e., Vn (x) <0 ∀n ≥ n ∗. La condición que especificamos para n ∗∗ es simplemente para garantizar que VN esté cambiando de un valor positivo a uno negativo (y no viceversa) y es trivial de implementar. Dada la existencia del límite superior, podemos diseñar un algoritmo para encontrar la estrategia de equilibrio (si existe). El algoritmo extrae el límite superior, ˆn, para el número de equilibrio de interacciones paralelas según el teorema 4. Fuera del conjunto de valores que satisfacen la condición de estabilidad definida anteriormente, el algoritmo elige el asociado con el valor de reserva más alto de acuerdo con la ecuación 10. Este es el equilibrio asociado con la utilidad más alta esperada para todos los agentes de acuerdo con el teorema 2. 0.1875 0.39 0.41 0.43 0.45 0.47 0.49 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Utilidad esperada VN (x) numeras de las interacciones de paralelo (n) VN++1 (xn) vn (xn) vn-1 (xn) ampliado Figura 2: El incentivo para desviarse de la estrategia (n, xn) El proceso se ilustra en la Figura 2 para un entorno artificial donde las utilidades de las asociaciones están asociados con una distribución uniforme. La función de costo utilizada es C (n) = 0.2 + 0.02N. El gráfico representa una utilidad esperada de un solo agente cuando todos los demás agentes están utilizando n interacciones paralelas (en el eje horizontal) y el valor de reserva apropiado Xn (calculado según la ecuación 10). Las diferentes curvas representan la utilidad esperada del agente cuando usa una estrategia: (a) (n, xn) similar a los otros agentes (marcados como VN (xn));(b) (n + 1, xn) (marcado como vn + 1 (xn));y (c) (n - 1, xn) (marcado como vn - 1 (xn)). De acuerdo con la discusión siguiente al Teorema 3, un equilibrio estable satisface: Vn (xn)> max {vn+1 (xn), vn - 1 (xn)}. La estrategia que satisface la última condición en nuestro ejemplo es (9, 0.437).4. Trabajo relacionado La búsqueda económica bilateral de asociaciones en la literatura de IA es un subdominio de la formación de coalición8. Si bien los modelos de formación de coalición generalmente consideran que los tamaños generales de coalición [24], el modelo de formación de asociación (a menudo denominado emparejamiento) considera entornos donde los agentes tienen un beneficio solo cuando se forman una asociación y este beneficio no puede mejorarse al extender la asociación a más deDos agentes [12, 23] (por ejemplo, en el caso de compradores y vendedores o aplicaciones entre pares). Como en el general 8, el uso del término asociación en este contexto se refiere al acuerdo entre dos agentes individuales para cooperar de manera predefinida. Por ejemplo, en la aplicación del vendedor del comprador, una asociación se define como una transacción acordada entre los dos partidos [9].Caso de formación de la coalición, los agentes tienen el incentivo de formar asociaciones cuando son incapaces de ejecutar una tarea por su cuenta o cuando la asociación puede mejorar sus servicios públicos individuales [14]. Se pueden encontrar varios mecanismos de correspondencia centralizados en la literatura [6, 2, 8]. Sin embargo, en muchos entornos MAS, en ausencia de cualquier mecanismo de coincidencia central confiable, el proceso de coincidencia está completamente distribuido. Si bien se reconoce que la búsqueda en entornos basados en agentes es costoso [11, 21, 1], la mayoría de los mecanismos de formación de coalición propuestos suponen que un agente puede escanear tantas oportunidades de asociación en su entorno según sea necesario o tener acceso a Matchers centraleso agentes medios [6]. La incorporación de la búsqueda costosa en este contexto es bastante rara [21] y hasta donde sabemos, hasta la fecha no se ha estudiado un modelo de búsqueda de socios de dos lados distribuido similar al modelo S-DM. La teoría de la búsqueda económica clásica ([15, 17], y las referencias en el mismo) aborda ampliamente el problema de un buscador que opera en un entorno costoso, buscando maximizar su utilidad a largo plazo. En estos modelos, clasificados como una búsqueda unilateral, el enfoque es establecer las estrategias óptimas para el buscador, asumiendo que no hay actividades de búsqueda mutua (es decir, no hay influencia en el entorno). Aquí el procedimiento de búsqueda secuencial a menudo se aplica, lo que permite al buscador investigar una sola [15] o múltiples oportunidades [7, 19] a la vez. Si bien se ha demostrado que el último método es beneficioso para el buscador, nunca se usó en los modelos de búsqueda de dos lados que siguieron (donde se modelan las actividades de búsqueda dual) [22, 5, 18]. Por lo tanto, en estos modelos, las estrategias de equilibrio siempre se desarrollan en función de la suposición de que los agentes interactúan con otros secuencialmente (es decir, con un agente a la vez). Un primer intento de integrar la búsqueda paralela en un modelo de búsqueda de dos lados se da en [21], como se detalla en la sección Introducción. Varias de las esencias de búsqueda de dos lados se pueden encontrar en la teoría estratégica de la negociación [3]: tanto la formación de la coalición como la coincidencia pueden representarse como un juego de negociación secuencial [4] en el que los pagos se definen como una función de la estructura de la coalición yse puede dividir de acuerdo con una regla de división fija o negociada. Sin embargo, en la literatura de negociación secuencial, la mayor parte del énfasis se pone en especificar los detalles del proceso de negociación secuencial sobre la división de la utilidad (o costo) propiedad de los partidos o la estrategia que la coalición necesita adoptar [20, 4]. Los modelos presentados en esta área no asocian el proceso de formación de la coalición con los costos de búsqueda, que es la esencia del análisis que la teoría de la búsqueda económica tiene como objetivo suministrar. Además, incluso en los modelos repetidos de negociación por pares [10], los agentes siempre se limitan a iniciar una sola interacción de negociación a la vez.5. Discusión y conclusiones El crecimiento fenomenal evidenciado en los últimos años en la cantidad de aplicaciones basadas en agentes de software, junto con la mejora continua en las capacidades de procesamiento y comunicación de los agentes, sugieren diversos incentivos para que los agentes mejoren su rendimiento de búsqueda mediante la aplicación de estrategias de búsqueda avanzadas, como la búsqueda paralela.. Se sabe que la técnica de interacciones múltiples es beneficiosa para los agentes tanto en la búsqueda económica unilateral como en dos lados [7, 16, 21], ya que permite a los agentes disminuir su costo promedio de aprender sobre posibles asociaciones y sus valores. En este artículo, proponemos un nuevo mecanismo de búsqueda paralelo de dos lados que difiere del existente en el sentido de que permite a los agentes retrasar su proceso de toma de decisiones con respecto a la aceptación y el rechazo de posibles asociaciones según sea necesario. Esto, en comparación con el modelo instantáneo existente [21] que obligan a cada agente a tomar una decisión simultánea con respecto a cada una de las posibles asociaciones que se le reveló durante la etapa de búsqueda actual.456 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) como se discutió en todo el documento, el nuevo método es mucho más intuitivo para el agente que el modelo existente: un agente siempre preferirá mantener todas las opciones disponibles. Además, como lo probamos en las secciones anteriores, un agente que hace la transición al nuevo método de búsqueda siempre se produce con una mejor utilidad. Como lo probamos en la Sección 2, a pesar de la transición a una toma de decisiones secuenciales, los puntos muertos nunca ocurren en el método propuesto siempre que todos los agentes usen las estrategias propuestas. Dado que nuestro análisis se basa en el equilibrio, una desviación de las estrategias propuestas no es beneficiosa. Del mismo modo, mostramos que una desviación de un solo agente (de regreso) a la estrategia instantánea de toma de decisiones no es beneficiosa. El único problema que puede surgir en la transición de una toma de decisiones instantánea a secuencial es cuando un agente falla (técnicamente) funcionar (retrasar sin depender la notificación a los agentes con los que interactuó). Si bien el análisis de equilibrio normalmente no considera el mal funcionamiento como una estrategia legítima, deseamos enfatizar que el problema del agente de mal funcionamiento se puede resolver utilizando un tiempo de espera simple para recibir respuestas y omitir este agente en el proceso de decisión secuencial si se excede el tiempo de espera. Nuestro análisis cubre todos los aspectos de la nueva técnica de búsqueda de dos lados, desde la construcción de estrategias individuales a través de la dinámica que conduce a la estabilidad (equilibrio). La dificultad en la extracción de las estrategias de equilibrio de los agentes en el nuevo modelo se deriva de la necesidad de modelar recursivamente, mientras establece una estrategia de agentes, el rechazo que otros agentes podrían enfrentar de otros agentes con los que interactúan. Esta complejidad (que no existe en modelos anteriores) se resuelve mediante la introducción de la función recursiva GK (x) en la Sección 2. Usando los diferentes teoremas y proposiciones que probamos, ofrecemos herramientas eficientes para calcular las estrategias de equilibrio de los agentes. Nuestras capacidades para producir un límite superior para el número de interacciones paralelas utilizadas en el equilibrio (Teorema 4) y identificar rápidamente (y eliminar) estrategias de no equilibrio (Teorema 3) resuelve el problema de la complejidad computacional asociada con tener que lidiar con unTeóricamente espacio de estrategia infinita. Si bien el análisis que presentamos se da en el contexto de los agentes de software, el modelo que sugerimos es general y puede aplicarse a cualquier entorno de búsqueda económica de dos caras donde los buscadores puedan buscar en paralelo. En particular, además de dominar débilmente el modelo de toma de decisiones instantáneo (como lo probamos en la sección de análisis), el método propuesto domina débilmente el modelo de búsqueda de dos lados puramente secuencial (donde cada agente interactúa con solo otro agente a la vez) [5]. Esto se deriva del hecho de que el método propuesto es una generalización de este último (es decir, en el peor de los casos, el agente puede interactuar con otro agente a la vez en paralelo). Naturalmente, el intento de integrar las técnicas de teoría de búsqueda en aplicaciones diarias plantea la pregunta de aplicabilidad. Las consideraciones de justificación y legitimidad para esta integración se discutieron en la amplia literatura a la que nos referimos en todo el documento. El documento actual no se centra en la aplicabilidad de rearguing, sino en la mejora del modelo de búsqueda de dos lados del núcleo. Vemos una gran importancia en futuras investigaciones que combinarán la negociación como parte del proceso de interacción. Creemos que dicha investigación puede dar lugar a muchas variantes ricas de nuestro modelo de búsqueda de dos lados.6. Referencias [1] Y. Bakos.

        "While AI search is an active process in which an agent finds a sequence of actions that will bring it from the initial state to a goal state, economic search refers to the identification of the best agent to commit to a partnership with. and the two interact bilaterally in order to learn the benefit encapsulated in a partnership between them.",
        "The interaction does not involve bargaining thus each agent merely needs to choose between accepting or rejecting the partnership with the other agent.",
        "A typical market where this kind of two-sided search takes place is the marriage market [22].",
        "Recent literature suggests various software agent-based applications where a two-sided distributed (i.e., with no centralized matching mechanisms) search takes place.",
        "An important class of such applications includes secondary markets for exchanging unexploited resources.",
        "An exchange mechanism is used in those cases where selling these resources is not the core business of the organization or when the overhead for selling them makes it non-beneficial.",
        "For example, through a twosided search, agents, representing different service providers, can exchange unused bandwidth [21] and communication satellites can transfer communication with a greater geographical coverage.",
        "Twosided agents-based search can also be found in applications of buyers and sellers in eMarkets and peer-to-peer applications.",
        "The twosided nature of the search suggests that a partnership between a pair of agents is formed only if it is mutually accepted.",
        "By forming a partnership the agents gain an immediate utility and terminate their search.",
        "When resuming the search, on the other hand, a more suitable partner might be found however some resources will need to be consumed for maintaining the search process.",
        "In this paper we focus on a specific class of two-sided search matching problems, in which the performance of the partnership applies to both parties, i.e., both gain an equal utility [13].",
        "The equal utility scenario is usually applicable in domains where the partners gain from the synergy between them.",
        "For example, consider tennis players that seek partners when playing doubles (or a canoes paddler looking for a partner to practice with).",
        "Here the players are being rewarded completely based on the teams (rather than the individual) performance.",
        "Other examples are the scenario where students need to form pairs for working together on an assignment, for which both partners share the same grade, and the scenario where two buyer agents interested in similar or interchangeable products join forces to buy a product together, taking advantage of discount for quantity (i.e. each of them enjoys the same reduced price).",
        "In all these applications, any two agents can form a partnership and the performance of any given partnership depends on the skills or the characteristics of its members.",
        "Furthermore, the equal utility scenario can also hold whenever there is an option for side-payments and the partnerships overall utility is equally split among the two agents forming it [22].",
        "While the two-sided search literature offers comprehensive equilibrium analysis for various models, it assumes that the agents search is conducted in a purely sequential manner: each agent locates and interacts with one other agent in its environment at a time 450 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS [5, 22].",
        "Nevertheless, when the search is assigned to autonomous software agents a better search strategy can be used.",
        "Here an agent can take advantage of its unique inherent filtering and information processing capabilities and its ability to efficiently (in comparison to people) maintain concurrent interactions with several other agents at each stage of its search.",
        "Such use of parallel interactions in search is favorable whenever the average cost2 per interaction with another agent, when interacting in parallel with a batch of other agents, is smaller than the cost of maintaining one interaction at a time (i.e., advantage to size).",
        "For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21].",
        "Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",
        "However, the agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their decision making process.",
        "Thus each agent, upon reviewing the opportunities available in a specific search stage, has to notify all other agents of its decision whether to commit to a partnership (at most with one of them) or reject the partnership (with the rest of them).",
        "This inherent restriction imposes a significant limitation on the agents strategic behavior.",
        "In our model, the agents are free to notify the other agents of their decisions in an asynchronous manner.",
        "The asynchronous approach allows the agents to re-evaluate their strategy, based on each new response they receive from the agents they interact with.",
        "This leads to a sequential decision making process by which each agent, upon sending a commit message to one of the other agents, delays its decision concerning a commitment or rejection of all other potential partnerships until receiving a response from that agent (i.e., the agent still maintains parallel interactions in each search stage, except that its decision making process at the end of the stage is sequential rather than instantaneous).",
        "The new model is a much more realistic pairwise model and, as we show in the analysis section, is always preferred by any single agents participating in the process.",
        "In the absence of other economic two-sided parallel search models, we use the model that relies on an instantaneous (synchronous) decision making process [21] (denoted I-DM throughout the rest of the paper) as a benchmark for evaluating the usefulness of our proposed sequential (asynchronous) decision making strategy (denoted S-DM).",
        "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",
        "This model is a general search model which can be applied in various (not necessarily software agents-based) domains.",
        "Second, we prove that the agents SDM strategy weakly dominates the I-DM strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the S-DM strategy when all other agents are using the I-DM strategy.",
        "Finally, by using an innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of different potential partnerships, we identify unique characteristics of the equilibrium strategies in the new model.",
        "These are used for supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the calculation of the agents equilibrium strategy.",
        "This latter contribution is 2 The term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for maintaining its search, such as: self advertisement, locating other agents, communicating with them and processing their offers. of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).",
        "We manage to extract the agents new equilibrium strategies without increasing the computational complexity in comparison to the I-DM model.",

        "F(U), (0 ≤ U < ∞).",
        "The agents are assumed to be acquainted with the utility distribution function f(x), however they cannot tell a-priori what utility can be gained by a partnership with any specific agent in their environment.",
        "Therefore, the only way by which an agent Ai can learn the value of a partnership with another agent Aj, U(Ai, Aj), is by interacting with agent Aj.",
        "Since each agent in two-sided search models has no prior information concerning any of the other agents in its environment, it initiates interactions (i.e., search) with other agents randomly.",

        "We define a search round/stage as the interval in which the agent interacts with several agents in parallel and learns the utility of forming a partnership with each of them.",
        "Based on the learned values, the agent needs to decide whether to commit or reject each of the potential partnerships available to it.",

        "In the above algorithm, any agent Ai first identifies the set A∗ of other agents it is willing to accept out of those reviewed in the current search stage and sends a reject message to the rest.",
        "Then it sends a commit message to the agent Aj ∈ A∗ that is associated with the partnership yielding the highest utility.",
        "If a reject message was received from agent Aj then this agent is removed from A∗ and a new commit message is sent according to the same criteria.",
        "The process continues until either: (a) the set A∗ becomes empty, in which case the agent initiates another search stage; or (b) a dual commitment is obtained, in which case the agent sends reject messages to the remaining agents in A∗ .",
        "The method differs from the one used in the I-DM model in the way it handles the commitment messages: in the I-DM model, after evaluating the set of utilities (step 4), the agent merely sends instantaneously a commit message to the agent associated with the greatest utility and a reject message to all the other agents it interacted with (as a replacement to steps 5-15 in the above procedure).",
        "Our proposed S-DM model is much more intuitive as it allows an agent to hold and possibly exploit relatively beneficial opportunities even if its first priority partnership is rejected by the other agent.",
        "In the I-DM model, on the other hand, since reject messages are sent alongside the commit message, simultaneously, a reject message from the agent associated with the best partnership enforces a new search round.",
        "Notice that the two-sided search mechanism above aligns with most other two-sided search mechanisms in a sense that it is based on random matching (i.e., in each search round the agent encounters a random sample of agents).",
        "While the maintenance of the random matching infrastructure is an interesting research question, it is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "Notwithstanding, we do wish to emphasize that given the large number of agents in the environment and the fact that in MAS the turnover rate is quite substantial due to the open nature of the environment (and the interoperability between environments).",
        "Therefore, the probability of ending up interacting with the same agent more than once, when initiating a random interaction, is practically negligible.",

        "Proof: (a) The method is optimal since it cannot be changed in a way that produces a better utility for the agent.",
        "Since bargaining is not applicable here (benefits are non-divisible) then the agents strategy is limited to accepting or rejecting offers.",
        "The decision of rejecting a partnership in step 6 is based only on the immediate utility that can be gained from this partnership in comparison to the expected utility of resuming the search (i.e., moving on to the next search stage) and is not affected by the willingness of the other agents to commit or reject a partnership with Ai.",
        "As for partnerships that yield a utility greater than the expected utility of resuming the search (i.e., the partnerships with agents from the set A∗ ), the agent always prefers to delay its decision concerning partnerships of this type until receiving all notifications concerning potential partnerships that are associated with a greater immediate utility.",
        "The delay never results with a loss of opportunity since the other agents decision concerning this opportunity is not affected by agent Ais willingness to commit or reject this opportunity (but rather by the other agents estimation of its expected utility if resuming the search and the rejection messages it receives for more beneficial potential partnerships).",
        "Finally, the agent cannot benefit from delaying a commit message to the agent associated with the highest utility in A∗ , thus will always send it a commit message. (b) We first prove the following lemma that states that the probability of having two partnering opportunities associated with an identical utility is zero.",
        "LEMMA 2.1.",

        "An immediate derivative from the above lemma is that no tiebreaking procedures are required and an agent in a waiting state is always waiting for a reply from the single agent that is associated with the highest utility among the agents in the set A∗ (i.e., no other agent in the set A∗ is associated with an equal utility).",
        "A deadlock can be formed only if we can create a cyclic sequence of agents in which any agent is waiting for a reply from the subsequent agent in the sequence.",

        "Since the search process is two-sided, our goal is to find an equilibrium set of strategies for the agents. 2.1 Strategy Structure Recall that each agent declines partnerships based on (a) the partnerships immediate utility in comparison to the agents expected utility from resuming search; and (b) achieving a mutual commitment (thus declining pending partnerships that were not rejected in (a)).",

        "The models presented in this area do not associate the coalition formation process with search costs, which is the essence of the analysis that economic search theory aims to supply.",
        "Furthermore, even in repeated pairwise bargaining [10] models the agents are always limited to initiating a single bargaining interaction at a time. 5.",
        "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The phenomenal growth evidenced in recent years in the number of software agent-based applications, alongside the continuous improvement in agents processing and communication capabilities, suggest various incentives for agents to improve their search performance by applying advanced search strategies such as parallel search.",
        "The multiple-interactions technique is known to be beneficial for agents both in one-sided and two-sided economic search [7, 16, 21], since it allows the agents to decrease their average cost of learning about potential partnerships and their values.",
        "In this paper we propose a new parallel two-sided search mechanism that differs from the existing one in a sense that it allows the agents to delay their decision making process concerning the acceptance and rejection of potential partnerships as necessary.",
        "This, in comparison to the existing instantaneous model [21] which force each agent to make a simultaneous decision concerning each of the potential partnerships revealed to it during the current search stage. 456 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) As discussed throughout the paper, the new method is much more intuitive to the agent than the existing model - an agent will always prefer to keep all options available.",
        "Furthermore, as we prove in the former sections, an agents transition to the new search method always results with a better utility.",
        "As we prove in Section 2, in spite of the transition to a sequential decision making, deadlocks never occur in the proposed method as long as all agents use the proposed strategies.",
        "Since our analysis is equilibrium-based, a deviation from the proposed strategies is not beneficial.",
        "Similarly, we show that a deviation of a single agent (back) to the instantaneous decision making strategy is not beneficial.",
        "The only problem that may arise in the transition from an instantaneous to sequential decision making is when an agent fails (technically) to function (endlessly delaying the notification to the agents it interacted with).",
        "While equilibrium analysis normally do not consider malfunction as a legitimate strategy, we do wish to emphasize that the malfunctioning agent problem can be resolved by using a simple timeout for receiving responses and skipping this agent in the sequential decision process if the timeout is exceeded.",
        "Our analysis covers all aspects of the new two-sided search technique, from individual strategy construction throughout the dynamics that lead to stability (equilibrium).",
        "The difficulty in the extraction of the agents equilibrium strategies in the new model derives from the need to recursively model, while setting an agents strategy, the rejection other agents might face from other agents they interact with.",
        "This complexity (that does not exist in former models) is resolved by the introduction of the recursive function Gk(x) in Section 2.",
        "Using the different theorems and propositions we prove, we proffer efficient tools for calculating the agents equilibrium strategies.",
        "Our capabilities to produce an upper bound for the number of parallel interactions used in equilibrium (Theorem 4) and to quickly identify (and eliminate) non-equilibrium strategies (Theorem 3) resolves the problem of the computational complexity associated with having to deal with a theoretically infinite strategy space.",
        "While the analysis we present is given in the context of software agents, the model we suggest is general, and can be applied to any two-sided economic search environment where the searchers can search in parallel.",
        "In particular, in addition to weakly dominating the instantaneous decision making model (as we prove in the analysis section) the proposed method weakly dominates the purely sequential two-sided search model (where each agent interacts with only one other agent at a time) [5].",
        "This derives from the fact that the proposed method is a generalization of the latter (i.e., in the worst case scenario, the agent can interact with one other agent at a time in parallel).",
        "Naturally the attempt to integrate search theory techniques into day-to-day applications brings up the applicability question.",
        "Justification and legitimacy considerations for this integration were discussed in the wide literature we refer to throughout the paper.",
        "The current paper is not focused on re-arguing applicability, but rather on the improvement of the the core two-sided search model.",
        "We see great importance in future research that will combine bargaining as part of the interaction process.",
        "We believe such research can result in many rich variants of our two-sided search model. 6.",

                "While AI search is an active process in which an agent finds a sequence of actions that will bring it from the initial state to a goal state, economic search refers to the identification of the best agent to commit to a partnership with. and the two interact bilaterally in order to learn the benefit encapsulated in a partnership between them.",
                "The interaction does not involve bargaining thus each agent merely needs to choose between accepting or rejecting the partnership with the other agent.",
                "A typical market where this kind of two-sided search takes place is the marriage market [22].",
                "Recent literature suggests various software agent-based applications where a two-sided distributed (i.e., with no centralized matching mechanisms) search takes place.",
                "An important class of such applications includes secondary markets for exchanging unexploited resources.",
                "An exchange mechanism is used in those cases where selling these resources is not the core business of the organization or when the overhead for selling them makes it non-beneficial.",
                "For example, through a twosided search, agents, representing different service providers, can exchange unused bandwidth [21] and communication satellites can transfer communication with a greater geographical coverage.",
                "Twosided agents-based search can also be found in applications of buyers and sellers in eMarkets and peer-to-peer applications.",
                "The twosided nature of the search suggests that a partnership between a pair of agents is formed only if it is mutually accepted.",
                "By forming a partnership the agents gain an immediate utility and terminate their search.",
                "When resuming the search, on the other hand, a more suitable partner might be found however some resources will need to be consumed for maintaining the search process.",
                "In this paper we focus on a specific class of two-sided search matching problems, in which the performance of the partnership applies to both parties, i.e., both gain an equal utility [13].",
                "The equal utility scenario is usually applicable in domains where the partners gain from the synergy between them.",
                "For example, consider tennis players that seek partners when playing doubles (or a canoes paddler looking for a partner to practice with).",
                "Here the players are being rewarded completely based on the teams (rather than the individual) performance.",
                "Other examples are the scenario where students need to form pairs for working together on an assignment, for which both partners share the same grade, and the scenario where two buyer agents interested in similar or interchangeable products join forces to buy a product together, taking advantage of discount for quantity (i.e. each of them enjoys the same reduced price).",
                "In all these applications, any two agents can form a partnership and the performance of any given partnership depends on the skills or the characteristics of its members.",
                "Furthermore, the equal utility scenario can also hold whenever there is an option for side-payments and the partnerships overall utility is equally split among the two agents forming it [22].",
                "While the two-sided search literature offers comprehensive equilibrium analysis for various models, it assumes that the agents search is conducted in a purely sequential manner: each agent locates and interacts with one other agent in its environment at a time 450 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS [5, 22].",
                "Nevertheless, when the search is assigned to autonomous software agents a better search strategy can be used.",
                "Here an agent can take advantage of its unique inherent filtering and information processing capabilities and its ability to efficiently (in comparison to people) maintain concurrent interactions with several other agents at each stage of its search.",
                "Such use of parallel interactions in search is favorable whenever the average cost2 per interaction with another agent, when interacting in parallel with a batch of other agents, is smaller than the cost of maintaining one interaction at a time (i.e., advantage to size).",
                "For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21].",
                "Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",
                "However, the agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their decision making process.",
                "Thus each agent, upon reviewing the opportunities available in a specific search stage, has to notify all other agents of its decision whether to commit to a partnership (at most with one of them) or reject the partnership (with the rest of them).",
                "This inherent restriction imposes a significant limitation on the agents strategic behavior.",
                "In our model, the agents are free to notify the other agents of their decisions in an asynchronous manner.",
                "The asynchronous approach allows the agents to re-evaluate their strategy, based on each new response they receive from the agents they interact with.",
                "This leads to a sequential decision making process by which each agent, upon sending a commit message to one of the other agents, delays its decision concerning a commitment or rejection of all other potential partnerships until receiving a response from that agent (i.e., the agent still maintains parallel interactions in each search stage, except that its decision making process at the end of the stage is sequential rather than instantaneous).",
                "The new model is a much more realistic pairwise model and, as we show in the analysis section, is always preferred by any single agents participating in the process.",
                "In the absence of other economic two-sided parallel search models, we use the model that relies on an instantaneous (synchronous) decision making process [21] (denoted I-DM throughout the rest of the paper) as a benchmark for evaluating the usefulness of our proposed sequential (asynchronous) decision making strategy (denoted S-DM).",
                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",
                "This model is a general search model which can be applied in various (not necessarily software agents-based) domains.",
                "Second, we prove that the agents SDM strategy weakly dominates the I-DM strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the S-DM strategy when all other agents are using the I-DM strategy.",
                "Finally, by using an innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of different potential partnerships, we identify unique characteristics of the equilibrium strategies in the new model.",
                "These are used for supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the calculation of the agents equilibrium strategy.",
                "This latter contribution is 2 The term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for maintaining its search, such as: self advertisement, locating other agents, communicating with them and processing their offers. of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).",
                "We manage to extract the agents new equilibrium strategies without increasing the computational complexity in comparison to the I-DM model.",
                "Throughout the paper we demonstrate the different properties of the new model and compare it with the I-DM model using an artificial synthetic environment.",

                "Since each agent in two-sided search models has no prior information concerning any of the other agents in its environment, it initiates interactions (i.e., search) with other agents randomly.",
                "The nature of the two-sided search application suggests that the agents are satisfied with having a single partner, thus once a partnership is formed the two agents forming it terminate their search process and leave the environment.",

                "Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",

                "Second, we prove that the agents SDM strategy weakly dominates the I-DM strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the S-DM strategy when all other agents are using the I-DM strategy.",

                "Since Vk(xk) = xk ∀k (according to Equation 9), the claims are: (a) if xk+1 < xk then xN < xk for all N ≥ k + 1, and (b) if xk−1 < xk then xN < xk for all N ≤ k − 1. (a) We start by proving that if xk+1 < xk then xk+2 < xk.",
                "Assume otherwise, i.e., xk+1 < xk and xk+2 > xk.",
                "Therefore, according to Equation 10, the following holds: 0 < ck+2 − 2ck+1 + ck < Z ∞ xk+2 (1 − Gk(y) k+2 k−1 )dy − 2 Z ∞ xk (1 − Gk(y) k+1 k−1 )dy + Z ∞ xk (1 − Gk(y) k k−1 )dy where the transition to inequality is valid since c(i) is convex.",
                "Since the assumption in this proof is that xk+2 > xk then the above can be transformed into: Z ∞ xk 2Gk(y) k+1 k−1 − Gk(y) k+2 k−1 − Gk(y) k k−1 dy > 0 (13) Now notice that the integrated term is actually −Gk(y) k k−1 ` 1− Gk(y) 1 k−1 ´2 which is obviously negative, contradicting the initial assumption, thus if xk+1 < xk then necessarily xk+2 < xk.",
                "Now we need to prove the same for any xk+j.",
                "We will prove this in two steps: first, if xk+i < xk then xk+2i < xk.",

                "If both the appropriate reservation values associated with the two latter sample sizes are smaller than xN then according to Theorems 3 the same holds when deviating to any other sample size k.

                "Hence if A(N) − c(N) < 0, then A(N, x) − c(N) < 0∀x and VN (x) < 0 ∀x.",
                "Next we prove that if A(N)−c(N) gets negative, it stays negative.",

                "While coalition formation models usually consider general coalition-sizes [24], the partnership formation model (often referred as matchmaking) considers environments where agents have a benefit only when forming a partnership and this benefit can not be improved by extending the partnership to more than two agents [12, 23] (e.g., in the case of buyers and sellers or peer-to-peer applications).",
                "As in the general 8 The use of the term partnership in this context refers to the agreement between two individual agents to cooperate in a pre-defined manner.",

                "Nevertheless, in the sequential bargaining literature, most emphasis is put on specifying the details of the sequential negotiating process over the division of the utility (or cost) jointly owned by parties or the strategy the coalition needs to adopt [20, 4].",

                "In particular, in addition to weakly dominating the instantaneous <br>decision</br> making model (as we prove in the analysis section) the proposed method weakly dominates the purely sequential two-sided search model (where each agent interacts with only one other agent at a time) [5].",
                "This derives from the fact that the proposed method is a generalization of the latter (i.e., in the worst case scenario, the agent can interact with one other agent at a time in parallel).",

                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",

                "As for partnerships that yield a utility greater than the expected utility of resuming the search (i.e., the partnerships with agents from the set A∗ ), the agent always prefers to delay its decision concerning partnerships of this type until receiving all notifications concerning potential partnerships that are associated with a greater immediate utility.",

                "For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21].",
                "Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",
                "However, the agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their decision making process.",
                "Thus each agent, upon reviewing the opportunities available in a specific search stage, has to notify all other agents of its decision whether to commit to a partnership (at most with one of them) or reject the partnership (with the rest of them).",

                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",
                "This model is a general search model which can be applied in various (not necessarily software agents-based) domains.",
                "Second, we prove that the agents SDM strategy weakly dominates the I-DM strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the S-DM strategy when all other agents are using the I-DM strategy.",
                "Finally, by using an innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of different potential partnerships, we identify unique characteristics of the equilibrium strategies in the new model.",
                "These are used for supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the calculation of the agents equilibrium strategy.",
                "This latter contribution is 2 The term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for maintaining its search, such as: self advertisement, locating other agents, communicating with them and processing their offers. of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).",
                "We manage to extract the agents new equilibrium strategies without increasing the computational complexity in comparison to the I-DM model.",

                "Assume otherwise, i.e., xk+1 < xk and xk+2 > xk.",
                "Therefore, according to Equation 10, the following holds: 0 < ck+2 − 2ck+1 + ck < Z ∞ xk+2 (1 − Gk(y) k+2 k−1 )dy − 2 Z ∞ xk (1 − Gk(y) k+1 k−1 )dy + Z ∞ xk (1 − Gk(y) k k−1 )dy where the transition to inequality is valid since c(i) is convex.",
                "Since the assumption in this proof is that xk+2 > xk then the above can be transformed into: Z ∞ xk 2Gk(y) k+1 k−1 − Gk(y) k+2 k−1 − Gk(y) k k−1 dy > 0 (13) Now notice that the integrated term is actually −Gk(y) k k−1 ` 1− Gk(y) 1 k−1 ´2 which is obviously negative, contradicting the initial assumption, thus if xk+1 < xk then necessarily xk+2 < xk.",
                "Now we need to prove the same for any xk+j.",
                "We will prove this in two steps: first, if xk+i < xk then xk+2i < xk.",

                "Twosided agents-based search can also be found in applications of buyers and sellers in eMarkets and peer-to-peer applications.",
                "The twosided nature of the search suggests that a partnership between a pair of agents is formed only if it is mutually accepted.",
                "By forming a partnership the agents gain an immediate utility and terminate their search.",

                "Other examples are the scenario where students need to form pairs for working together on an assignment, for which both partners share the same grade, and the scenario where two buyer agents interested in similar or interchangeable products join forces to buy a product together, taking advantage of discount for quantity (i.e. each of them enjoys the same reduced price).",
                "In all these applications, any two agents can form a partnership and the performance of any given partnership depends on the skills or the characteristics of its members.",

                "While the two-sided search literature offers comprehensive equilibrium analysis for various models, it assumes that the agents search is conducted in a purely sequential manner: each agent locates and interacts with one other agent in its environment at a time 450 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS [5, 22].",
                "Nevertheless, when the search is assigned to autonomous software agents a better search strategy can be used.",

                "Such use of parallel interactions in search is favorable whenever the average cost2 per interaction with another agent, when interacting in parallel with a batch of other agents, is smaller than the cost of maintaining one interaction at a time (i.e., advantage to size).",
                "For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21].",
                "Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",
                "However, the agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their decision making process.",
                "Thus each agent, upon reviewing the opportunities available in a specific search stage, has to notify all other agents of its decision whether to commit to a partnership (at most with one of them) or reject the partnership (with the rest of them).",
                "This inherent restriction imposes a significant limitation on the agents strategic behavior.",
                "In our model, the agents are free to notify the other agents of their decisions in an asynchronous manner.",
                "The asynchronous approach allows the agents to re-evaluate their strategy, based on each new response they receive from the agents they interact with.",
                "This leads to a sequential decision making process by which each agent, upon sending a commit message to one of the other agents, delays its decision concerning a commitment or rejection of all other potential partnerships until receiving a response from that agent (i.e., the agent still maintains parallel interactions in each search stage, except that its decision making process at the end of the stage is sequential rather than instantaneous).",
                "The new model is a much more realistic pairwise model and, as we show in the analysis section, is always preferred by any single agents participating in the process.",

                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",
                "This model is a general search model which can be applied in various (not necessarily software agents-based) domains.",
                "Second, we prove that the agents SDM strategy weakly dominates the I-DM strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the S-DM strategy when all other agents are using the I-DM strategy.",
                "Finally, by using an innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of different potential partnerships, we identify unique characteristics of the equilibrium strategies in the new model.",
                "These are used for supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the calculation of the agents equilibrium strategy.",
                "This latter contribution is 2 The term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for maintaining its search, such as: self advertisement, locating other agents, communicating with them and processing their offers. of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).",
                "We manage to extract the agents new equilibrium strategies without increasing the computational complexity in comparison to the I-DM model.",

                "As for partnerships that yield a utility greater than the expected utility of resuming the search (i.e., the partnerships with agents from the set A∗ ), the agent always prefers to delay its decision concerning partnerships of this type until receiving all notifications concerning potential partnerships that are associated with a greater immediate utility.",

                "An immediate derivative from the above lemma is that no tiebreaking procedures are required and an agent in a waiting state is always waiting for a reply from the single agent that is associated with the highest utility among the agents in the set A∗ (i.e., no other agent in the set A∗ is associated with an equal utility).",
                "A deadlock can be formed only if we can create a cyclic sequence of agents in which any agent is waiting for a reply from the subsequent agent in the sequence.",
                "However, in our method any agent Ai will be waiting for a reply from another agent Aj, to which it sent a commit message, only if: (1) any agent Ak ∈ A, associated with a utility U(Ai, Ak) > U(Ai, Aj), has already rejected the partnership with agent Ai; and (2) agent Aj itself is waiting for a reply from agent Al where U(Al, Aj) > U(Aj, Ai).",

                "The twosided nature of the search suggests that a partnership between a pair of agents is formed only if it is mutually accepted.",

                "For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21].",
                "Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",
                "However, the agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their decision making process.",
                "Thus each agent, upon reviewing the opportunities available in a specific search stage, has to notify all other agents of its decision whether to commit to a partnership (at most with one of them) or reject the partnership (with the rest of them).",

                "The new model is a much more realistic pairwise model and, as we show in the analysis section, is always preferred by any single agents participating in the process.",

                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",
                "This model is a general search model which can be applied in various (not necessarily software agents-based) domains.",
                "Second, we prove that the agents SDM strategy weakly dominates the I-DM strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the S-DM strategy when all other agents are using the I-DM strategy.",
                "Finally, by using an innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of different potential partnerships, we identify unique characteristics of the equilibrium strategies in the new model.",
                "These are used for supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the calculation of the agents equilibrium strategy.",
                "This latter contribution is 2 The term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for maintaining its search, such as: self advertisement, locating other agents, communicating with them and processing their offers. of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).",
                "We manage to extract the agents new equilibrium strategies without increasing the computational complexity in comparison to the I-DM model.",

                "For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21].",
                "Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",

                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",

                "Nevertheless, in the sequential bargaining literature, most emphasis is put on specifying the details of the sequential negotiating process over the division of the utility (or cost) jointly owned by parties or the strategy the coalition needs to adopt [20, 4].",

                "The only problem that may arise in the transition from an instantaneous to sequential decision making is when an agent fails (technically) to function (endlessly delaying the notification to the agents it interacted with).",

                "In particular, in addition to weakly dominating the instantaneous decision making model (as we prove in the analysis section) the proposed method weakly dominates the purely sequential two-sided search model (where each agent interacts with only one other agent at a time) [5].",
                "This derives from the fact that the proposed method is a generalization of the latter (i.e., in the worst case scenario, the agent can interact with one other agent at a time in parallel).",

                "While AI search is an active process in which an agent finds a sequence of actions that will bring it from the initial state to a goal state, economic search refers to the identification of the best agent to commit to a partnership with. and the two interact bilaterally in order to learn the benefit encapsulated in a partnership between them.",
                "The interaction does not involve bargaining thus each agent merely needs to choose between accepting or rejecting the partnership with the other agent.",
                "A typical market where this kind of two-sided search takes place is the marriage market [22].",
                "Recent literature suggests various software agent-based applications where a two-sided distributed (i.e., with no centralized matching mechanisms) search takes place.",
                "An important class of such applications includes secondary markets for exchanging unexploited resources.",
                "An exchange mechanism is used in those cases where selling these resources is not the core business of the organization or when the overhead for selling them makes it non-beneficial.",
                "For example, through a twosided search, agents, representing different service providers, can exchange unused bandwidth [21] and communication satellites can transfer communication with a greater geographical coverage.",
                "Twosided agents-based search can also be found in applications of buyers and sellers in eMarkets and peer-to-peer applications.",
                "The twosided nature of the search suggests that a partnership between a pair of agents is formed only if it is mutually accepted.",
                "By forming a partnership the agents gain an immediate utility and terminate their search.",
                "When resuming the search, on the other hand, a more suitable partner might be found however some resources will need to be consumed for maintaining the search process.",
                "In this paper we focus on a specific class of two-sided search matching problems, in which the performance of the partnership applies to both parties, i.e., both gain an equal utility [13].",
                "The equal utility scenario is usually applicable in domains where the partners gain from the synergy between them.",
                "For example, consider tennis players that seek partners when playing doubles (or a canoes paddler looking for a partner to practice with).",
                "Here the players are being rewarded completely based on the teams (rather than the individual) performance.",
                "Other examples are the scenario where students need to form pairs for working together on an assignment, for which both partners share the same grade, and the scenario where two buyer agents interested in similar or interchangeable products join forces to buy a product together, taking advantage of discount for quantity (i.e. each of them enjoys the same reduced price).",
                "In all these applications, any two agents can form a partnership and the performance of any given partnership depends on the skills or the characteristics of its members.",
                "Furthermore, the equal utility scenario can also hold whenever there is an option for side-payments and the partnerships overall utility is equally split among the two agents forming it [22].",
                "While the two-sided search literature offers comprehensive equilibrium analysis for various models, it assumes that the agents search is conducted in a purely sequential manner: each agent locates and interacts with one other agent in its environment at a time 450 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS [5, 22].",
                "Nevertheless, when the search is assigned to autonomous software agents a better search strategy can be used.",
                "Here an agent can take advantage of its unique inherent filtering and information processing capabilities and its ability to efficiently (in comparison to people) maintain concurrent interactions with several other agents at each stage of its search.",
                "Such use of <br>parallel interaction</br>s in search is favorable whenever the average cost2 per interaction with another agent, when interacting in parallel with a batch of other agents, is smaller than the cost of maintaining one interaction at a time (i.e., advantage to size).",
                "For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of <br>parallel interaction</br>s increases [21].",
                "Despite the advantages identified for <br>parallel interaction</br>s in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",
                "However, the agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their decision making process.",
                "Thus each agent, upon reviewing the opportunities available in a specific search stage, has to notify all other agents of its decision whether to commit to a partnership (at most with one of them) or reject the partnership (with the rest of them).",
                "This inherent restriction imposes a significant limitation on the agents strategic behavior.",
                "In our model, the agents are free to notify the other agents of their decisions in an asynchronous manner.",
                "The asynchronous approach allows the agents to re-evaluate their strategy, based on each new response they receive from the agents they interact with.",
                "This leads to a sequential decision making process by which each agent, upon sending a commit message to one of the other agents, delays its decision concerning a commitment or rejection of all other potential partnerships until receiving a response from that agent (i.e., the agent still maintains <br>parallel interaction</br>s in each search stage, except that its decision making process at the end of the stage is sequential rather than instantaneous).",
                "The new model is a much more realistic pairwise model and, as we show in the analysis section, is always preferred by any single agents participating in the process.",
                "In the absence of other economic two-sided parallel search models, we use the model that relies on an instantaneous (synchronous) decision making process [21] (denoted I-DM throughout the rest of the paper) as a benchmark for evaluating the usefulness of our proposed sequential (asynchronous) decision making strategy (denoted S-DM).",
                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",
                "This model is a general search model which can be applied in various (not necessarily software agents-based) domains.",
                "Second, we prove that the agents SDM strategy weakly dominates the I-DM strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the S-DM strategy when all other agents are using the I-DM strategy.",
                "Finally, by using an innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of different potential partnerships, we identify unique characteristics of the equilibrium strategies in the new model.",
                "These are used for supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the calculation of the agents equilibrium strategy.",
                "This latter contribution is 2 The term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for maintaining its search, such as: self advertisement, locating other agents, communicating with them and processing their offers. of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).",
                "We manage to extract the agents new equilibrium strategies without increasing the computational complexity in comparison to the I-DM model.",
                "Throughout the paper we demonstrate the different properties of the new model and compare it with the I-DM model using an artificial synthetic environment.",
                "In the following section we formally present the S-DM model.",
                "An equilibrium analysis and computational means for finding the equilibrium strategy are provided in Section 3.",
                "In Section 4 we review related MAS and economic search theory literature.",
                "We conclude with a discussion and suggest directions for future research in Section 5. 2.",

                "Any agent Ai can form a partnership with any other agent Aj in the environment, associated with an immediate perceived utility U(Ai, Aj) for both agents.",
                "As in many other partnership formation models (see [5, 21]) we assume that the value of U(x, y) (where x and y are any two agents in the environment) is randomly drawn from a continuous population characterized with a probability distribution function (p.d.f.) f(U) and a cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.)",
                "F(U), (0 ≤ U < ∞).",
                "The agents are assumed to be acquainted with the utility distribution function f(x), however they cannot tell a-priori what utility can be gained by a partnership with any specific agent in their environment.",
                "Therefore, the only way by which an agent Ai can learn the value of a partnership with another agent Aj, U(Ai, Aj), is by interacting with agent Aj.",
                "Since each agent in two-sided search models has no prior information concerning any of the other agents in its environment, it initiates interactions (i.e., search) with other agents randomly.",
                "The nature of the two-sided search application suggests that the agents are satisfied with having a single partner, thus once a partnership is formed the two agents forming it terminate their search process and leave the environment.",
                "The agents are not limited to interacting with a single potential partner agent at a time, but rather can select to interact with several other agents in parallel.",
                "We define a search round/stage as the interval in which the agent interacts with several agents in parallel and learns the utility of forming a partnership with each of them.",
                "Based on the learned values, the agent needs to decide whether to commit or reject each of the potential partnerships available to it.",
                "Commitment is achieved by sending a commit message to the appropriate agent and an agent cannot commit to more than one potential partnership simultaneously.",
                "Declining a partnership is achieved by sending a reject message.",
                "The communication between the agents is assumed to be asynchronous and each agent can delay its decision, concerning any given potential partnership, as necessary.4 If two agents Ai and Aj mutually commit to a partnership between 3 The infinite number of agents assumption is common in two-sided search models (see [5, 22, 21]).",
                "In many domains (e.g., eCommerce) this derives from the high entrance and leave rates, thus the probability of running into the same agent in a random match is negligible. 4 Notice that the asynchronous procedure does not eliminate the inherent structure of the search.",
                "The search is still based on stages/rounds where on each search round the agent interacts with several other agents, except that now the agent can delay its decision making process (within each search round) as necessary.",

                "If an agent does not form a partnership in a given search stage, it continues to its next search stage and interacts with more agents in a similar manner.",
                "Given the option for asynchronous decision making, each individual agent, Ai, follows the following procedure: 1: loop 2: Set N (number of <br>parallel interaction</br>s for next search round) 3: Locate randomly a set A = {A1, . . . , AN } of agents to interact with 4: Evaluate the set of utilities {U(Ai, A1), . . . , U(Ai, AN )} 5: Set A∗ ={Aj|Aj ∈A and U(Ai, Aj)>U(resume)} 6: Send a reject message to each agent in the set {A \\ A∗ } 7: while (A∗ = ∅) do 8: Send a commit message to Aj = argmaxAl∈A∗ U(Ai, Al) 9: Remove Aj from A∗ 10: Wait for Ajs decision 11: if (Aj responded commit) then 12: Send reject messages to the remaining agents in A∗ 13: Terminate search 14: end if 15: end while 16: end loop where U(resume) denotes the expected utility of continuing the search (in the following paragraphs we show that U(resume) is fixed throughout the search and derives from the agents strategy).",
                "In the above algorithm, any agent Ai first identifies the set A∗ of other agents it is willing to accept out of those reviewed in the current search stage and sends a reject message to the rest.",
                "Then it sends a commit message to the agent Aj ∈ A∗ that is associated with the partnership yielding the highest utility.",
                "If a reject message was received from agent Aj then this agent is removed from A∗ and a new commit message is sent according to the same criteria.",
                "The process continues until either: (a) the set A∗ becomes empty, in which case the agent initiates another search stage; or (b) a dual commitment is obtained, in which case the agent sends reject messages to the remaining agents in A∗ .",
                "The method differs from the one used in the I-DM model in the way it handles the commitment messages: in the I-DM model, after evaluating the set of utilities (step 4), the agent merely sends instantaneously a commit message to the agent associated with the greatest utility and a reject message to all the other agents it interacted with (as a replacement to steps 5-15 in the above procedure).",
                "Our proposed S-DM model is much more intuitive as it allows an agent to hold and possibly exploit relatively beneficial opportunities even if its first priority partnership is rejected by the other agent.",
                "In the I-DM model, on the other hand, since reject messages are sent alongside the commit message, simultaneously, a reject message from the agent associated with the best partnership enforces a new search round.",
                "Notice that the two-sided search mechanism above aligns with most other two-sided search mechanisms in a sense that it is based on random matching (i.e., in each search round the agent encounters a random sample of agents).",
                "While the maintenance of the random matching infrastructure is an interesting research question, it is beyond the scope of this paper.",
                "Notwithstanding, we do wish to emphasize that given the large number of agents in the environment and the fact that in MAS the turnover rate is quite substantial due to the open nature of the environment (and the interoperability between environments).",
                "Therefore, the probability of ending up interacting with the same agent more than once, when initiating a random interaction, is practically negligible.",
                "THEOREM 1.",
                "The S-DM agents decision making process: (a) is the optimal one (maximizes the utility) for any individual agent in the environment; and (b) guarantees a zero deadlock probability for any given agent in the environment.",
                "Proof: (a) The method is optimal since it cannot be changed in a way that produces a better utility for the agent.",
                "Since bargaining is not applicable here (benefits are non-divisible) then the agents strategy is limited to accepting or rejecting offers.",
                "The decision of rejecting a partnership in step 6 is based only on the immediate utility that can be gained from this partnership in comparison to the expected utility of resuming the search (i.e., moving on to the next search stage) and is not affected by the willingness of the other agents to commit or reject a partnership with Ai.",
                "As for partnerships that yield a utility greater than the expected utility of resuming the search (i.e., the partnerships with agents from the set A∗ ), the agent always prefers to delay its decision concerning partnerships of this type until receiving all notifications concerning potential partnerships that are associated with a greater immediate utility.",
                "The delay never results with a loss of opportunity since the other agents decision concerning this opportunity is not affected by agent Ais willingness to commit or reject this opportunity (but rather by the other agents estimation of its expected utility if resuming the search and the rejection messages it receives for more beneficial potential partnerships).",
                "Finally, the agent cannot benefit from delaying a commit message to the agent associated with the highest utility in A∗ , thus will always send it a commit message. (b) We first prove the following lemma that states that the probability of having two partnering opportunities associated with an identical utility is zero.",

                "When f is a continuous distribution function, then lim y→x »Z y z=x f(z)dz -2 ! = 0.",
                "Proof: since f is continuous and the interval between x and y is finite, by the intermediate value theorem (found in most calculus texts) there exists a c between x and y thatZ y z=x f(z)dz = f(c)(y − x) (intuitively, a rectangle with the base from z = x to z = y and height = f(c) has the same area as the integral on the left hand side.).",
                "Therefore »Z y z=x f(z)dz -2 = |f(c)|2 |y − x|2 When y → x, f(c) stays bounded due to continuity of f, moreover limy→x f(c) = f(x), hence lim y→x »Z y z=x f(z)dz -2 ! = f(x)2 lim y→x |y − x|2 = 0. .",
                "An immediate derivative from the above lemma is that no tiebreaking procedures are required and an agent in a waiting state is always waiting for a reply from the single agent that is associated with the highest utility among the agents in the set A∗ (i.e., no other agent in the set A∗ is associated with an equal utility).",
                "A deadlock can be formed only if we can create a cyclic sequence of agents in which any agent is waiting for a reply from the subsequent agent in the sequence.",
                "However, in our method any agent Ai will be waiting for a reply from another agent Aj, to which it sent a commit message, only if: (1) any agent Ak ∈ A, associated with a utility U(Ai, Ak) > U(Ai, Aj), has already rejected the partnership with agent Ai; and (2) agent Aj itself is waiting for a reply from agent Al where U(Al, Aj) > U(Aj, Ai).",
                "Therefore, if we have a sequence of waiting agents then the utility associated with partnerships between any two subsequent agents in the sequence must increase along the sequence.",

                "The same logic can be applied to any longer sequence. 2 The search activity is assumed to be costly [11, 1, 16] in a way that any agent needs to consume some of its resources in order to locate other agents to interact with, and for maintaining the interactions themselves.",
                "We assume utilities and costs are additive and that the agents are trying to maximize their overall utility, defined as the utility from the partnership formed minus the aggregated search costs along the search process.",
                "The agents cost of interacting with N other agents (in parallel) is given by the function c(N).",

                "Since the search process is two-sided, our goal is to find an equilibrium set of strategies for the agents. 2.1 Strategy Structure Recall that each agent declines partnerships based on (a) the partnerships immediate utility in comparison to the agents expected utility from resuming search; and (b) achieving a mutual commitment (thus declining pending partnerships that were not rejected in (a)).",
                "Therefore an agents strategy can be represented by a pair (Nt , xt ) where Nt is the number of agents with whom it chooses to interact in search stage t and xt is its reservation value5 (a threshold) for accepting/rejecting the resulting N potential partnerships.",

                "For example, through a twosided search, agents, representing different service providers, can exchange unused bandwidth [21] and communication satellites can transfer communication with a greater geographical coverage.",
                "Twosided agents-based search can also be found in applications of buyers and sellers in eMarkets and peer-to-peer applications.",
                "The twosided nature of the search suggests that a partnership between a pair of agents is formed only if it is mutually accepted.",

                "For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21].",
                "Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",
                "However, the agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their decision making process.",
                "Thus each agent, upon reviewing the opportunities available in a specific search stage, has to notify all other agents of its decision whether to commit to a partnership (at most with one of them) or reject the partnership (with the rest of them).",

                "The asynchronous approach allows the agents to re-evaluate their strategy, based on each new response they receive from the agents they interact with.",
                "This leads to a sequential decision making process by which each agent, upon sending a commit message to one of the other agents, delays its decision concerning a commitment or rejection of all other potential partnerships until receiving a response from that agent (i.e., the agent still maintains parallel interactions in each search stage, except that its decision making process at the end of the stage is sequential rather than instantaneous).",
                "The new model is a much more realistic pairwise model and, as we show in the analysis section, is always preferred by any single agents participating in the process.",

                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",
                "This model is a general search model which can be applied in various (not necessarily software agents-based) domains.",
                "Second, we prove that the agents SDM strategy weakly dominates the I-DM strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the S-DM strategy when all other agents are using the I-DM strategy.",
                "Finally, by using an innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of different potential partnerships, we identify unique characteristics of the equilibrium strategies in the new model.",
                "These are used for supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the calculation of the agents equilibrium strategy.",
                "This latter contribution is 2 The term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for maintaining its search, such as: self advertisement, locating other agents, communicating with them and processing their offers. of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).",
                "We manage to extract the agents new equilibrium strategies without increasing the computational complexity in comparison to the I-DM model.",

                "While the latter method is proven to be beneficial for the searcher, it was never used in the two-sided search models that followed (where dual search activities are modeled) [22, 5, 18].",

                "The only problem that may arise in the transition from an instantaneous to sequential decision making is when an agent fails (technically) to function (endlessly delaying the notification to the agents it interacted with).",

                "Our capabilities to produce an upper bound for the number of parallel interactions used in equilibrium (Theorem 4) and to quickly identify (and eliminate) non-equilibrium strategies (Theorem 3) resolves the problem of the computational complexity associated with having to deal with a theoretically infinite strategy space.",
                "While the analysis we present is given in the context of software agents, the model we suggest is general, and can be applied to any two-sided economic search environment where the searchers can search in parallel.",
                "In particular, in addition to weakly dominating the instantaneous decision making model (as we prove in the analysis section) the proposed method weakly dominates the purely sequential two-sided search model (where each agent interacts with only one other agent at a time) [5].",
                "This derives from the fact that the proposed method is a generalization of the latter (i.e., in the worst case scenario, the agent can interact with one other agent at a time in parallel).",

                "In each search stage, each of the agents is randomly matched with several other agents in parallel, and makes a decision whether to accept a potential partnership with one of them.",
                "The distinguishing feature of the proposed model is that the agents are not restricted to maintaining a synchronized (instantaneous) decision protocol and can sequentially accept and reject partnerships within the same search stage.",
                "We analyze the dynamics which drive the agents strategies towards a stable equilibrium in the new model and show that the proposed search strategy weakly dominates the one currently in use for the two-sided parallel economic search model.",

                "While AI search is an active process in which an agent finds a sequence of actions that will bring it from the initial state to a goal state, economic search refers to the identification of the best agent to commit to a partnership with. and the two interact bilaterally in order to learn the benefit encapsulated in a partnership between them.",
                "The interaction does not involve bargaining thus each agent merely needs to choose between accepting or rejecting the partnership with the other agent.",
                "A typical market where this kind of two-sided search takes place is the marriage market [22].",
                "Recent literature suggests various software agent-based applications where a two-sided distributed (i.e., with no centralized matching mechanisms) search takes place.",

                "An exchange mechanism is used in those cases where selling these resources is not the core business of the organization or when the overhead for selling them makes it non-beneficial.",
                "For example, through a twosided search, agents, representing different service providers, can exchange unused bandwidth [21] and communication satellites can transfer communication with a greater geographical coverage.",
                "Twosided agents-based search can also be found in applications of buyers and sellers in eMarkets and peer-to-peer applications.",
                "The twosided nature of the search suggests that a partnership between a pair of agents is formed only if it is mutually accepted.",
                "By forming a partnership the agents gain an immediate utility and terminate their search.",
                "When resuming the search, on the other hand, a more suitable partner might be found however some resources will need to be consumed for maintaining the search process.",
                "In this paper we focus on a specific class of two-sided search matching problems, in which the performance of the partnership applies to both parties, i.e., both gain an equal utility [13].",
                "The equal utility scenario is usually applicable in domains where the partners gain from the synergy between them.",
                "For example, consider tennis players that seek partners when playing doubles (or a canoes paddler looking for a partner to practice with).",
                "Here the players are being rewarded completely based on the teams (rather than the individual) performance.",
                "Other examples are the scenario where students need to form pairs for working together on an assignment, for which both partners share the same grade, and the scenario where two buyer agents interested in similar or interchangeable products join forces to buy a product together, taking advantage of discount for quantity (i.e. each of them enjoys the same reduced price).",
                "In all these applications, any two agents can form a partnership and the performance of any given partnership depends on the skills or the characteristics of its members.",
                "Furthermore, the equal utility scenario can also hold whenever there is an option for side-payments and the partnerships overall utility is equally split among the two agents forming it [22].",
                "While the two-sided search literature offers comprehensive equilibrium analysis for various models, it assumes that the agents search is conducted in a purely sequential manner: each agent locates and interacts with one other agent in its environment at a time 450 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS [5, 22].",
                "Nevertheless, when the search is assigned to autonomous software agents a better search strategy can be used.",
                "Here an agent can take advantage of its unique inherent filtering and information processing capabilities and its ability to efficiently (in comparison to people) maintain concurrent interactions with several other agents at each stage of its search.",
                "Such use of parallel interactions in search is favorable whenever the average cost2 per interaction with another agent, when interacting in parallel with a batch of other agents, is smaller than the cost of maintaining one interaction at a time (i.e., advantage to size).",
                "For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21].",
                "Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",
                "However, the agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their decision making process.",
                "Thus each agent, upon reviewing the opportunities available in a specific search stage, has to notify all other agents of its decision whether to commit to a partnership (at most with one of them) or reject the partnership (with the rest of them).",
                "This inherent restriction imposes a significant limitation on the agents strategic behavior.",
                "In our model, the agents are free to notify the other agents of their decisions in an asynchronous manner.",
                "The asynchronous approach allows the agents to re-evaluate their strategy, based on each new response they receive from the agents they interact with.",
                "This leads to a sequential decision making process by which each agent, upon sending a commit message to one of the other agents, delays its decision concerning a commitment or rejection of all other potential partnerships until receiving a response from that agent (i.e., the agent still maintains parallel interactions in each search stage, except that its decision making process at the end of the stage is sequential rather than instantaneous).",
                "The new model is a much more realistic pairwise model and, as we show in the analysis section, is always preferred by any single agents participating in the process.",
                "In the absence of other economic two-sided parallel search models, we use the model that relies on an instantaneous (synchronous) decision making process [21] (denoted I-DM throughout the rest of the paper) as a benchmark for evaluating the usefulness of our proposed sequential (asynchronous) decision making strategy (denoted S-DM).",
                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",
                "This model is a general search model which can be applied in various (not necessarily software agents-based) domains.",
                "Second, we prove that the agents SDM strategy weakly dominates the I-DM strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the S-DM strategy when all other agents are using the I-DM strategy.",
                "Finally, by using an innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of different potential partnerships, we identify unique characteristics of the equilibrium strategies in the new model.",
                "These are used for supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the calculation of the agents equilibrium strategy.",
                "This latter contribution is 2 The term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for maintaining its search, such as: self advertisement, locating other agents, communicating with them and processing their offers. of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).",
                "We manage to extract the agents new equilibrium strategies without increasing the computational complexity in comparison to the I-DM model.",
                "Throughout the paper we demonstrate the different properties of the new model and compare it with the I-DM model using an artificial synthetic environment.",

                "Since each agent in two-sided search models has no prior information concerning any of the other agents in its environment, it initiates interactions (i.e., search) with other agents randomly.",
                "The nature of the two-sided search application suggests that the agents are satisfied with having a single partner, thus once a partnership is formed the two agents forming it terminate their search process and leave the environment.",

                "In many domains (e.g., eCommerce) this derives from the high entrance and leave rates, thus the probability of running into the same agent in a random match is negligible. 4 Notice that the asynchronous procedure does not eliminate the inherent structure of the search.",

                "The method differs from the one used in the I-DM model in the way it handles the commitment messages: in the I-DM model, after evaluating the set of utilities (step 4), the agent merely sends instantaneously a commit message to the agent associated with the greatest utility and a reject message to all the other agents it interacted with (as a replacement to steps 5-15 in the above procedure).",
                "Our proposed S-DM model is much more intuitive as it allows an agent to hold and possibly exploit relatively beneficial opportunities even if its first priority partnership is rejected by the other agent.",
                "In the I-DM model, on the other hand, since reject messages are sent alongside the commit message, simultaneously, a reject message from the agent associated with the best partnership enforces a new search round.",
                "Notice that the two-sided search mechanism above aligns with most other two-sided search mechanisms in a sense that it is based on random matching (i.e., in each search round the agent encounters a random sample of agents).",

                "Therefore, the probability of ending up interacting with the same agent more than once, when initiating a random interaction, is practically negligible.",

                "Since bargaining is not applicable here (benefits are non-divisible) then the agents strategy is limited to accepting or rejecting offers.",
                "The decision of rejecting a partnership in step 6 is based only on the immediate utility that can be gained from this partnership in comparison to the expected utility of resuming the search (i.e., moving on to the next search stage) and is not affected by the willingness of the other agents to commit or reject a partnership with Ai.",
                "As for partnerships that yield a utility greater than the expected utility of resuming the search (i.e., the partnerships with agents from the set A∗ ), the agent always prefers to delay its decision concerning partnerships of this type until receiving all notifications concerning potential partnerships that are associated with a greater immediate utility.",
                "The delay never results with a loss of opportunity since the other agents decision concerning this opportunity is not affected by agent Ais willingness to commit or reject this opportunity (but rather by the other agents estimation of its expected utility if resuming the search and the rejection messages it receives for more beneficial potential partnerships).",
                "Finally, the agent cannot benefit from delaying a commit message to the agent associated with the highest utility in A∗ , thus will always send it a commit message. (b) We first prove the following lemma that states that the probability of having two partnering opportunities associated with an identical utility is zero.",

                "Proof: since f is continuous and the interval between x and y is finite, by the intermediate value theorem (found in most calculus texts) there exists a c between x and y thatZ y z=x f(z)dz = f(c)(y − x) (intuitively, a rectangle with the base from z = x to z = y and height = f(c) has the same area as the integral on the left hand side.).",

                "An immediate derivative from the above lemma is that no tiebreaking procedures are required and an agent in a waiting state is always waiting for a reply from the single agent that is associated with the highest utility among the agents in the set A∗ (i.e., no other agent in the set A∗ is associated with an equal utility).",
                "A deadlock can be formed only if we can create a cyclic sequence of agents in which any agent is waiting for a reply from the subsequent agent in the sequence.",
                "However, in our method any agent Ai will be waiting for a reply from another agent Aj, to which it sent a commit message, only if: (1) any agent Ak ∈ A, associated with a utility U(Ai, Ak) > U(Ai, Aj), has already rejected the partnership with agent Ai; and (2) agent Aj itself is waiting for a reply from agent Al where U(Al, Aj) > U(Aj, Ai).",
                "Therefore, if we have a sequence of waiting agents then the utility associated with partnerships between any two subsequent agents in the sequence must increase along the sequence.",

                "Since the search process is two-sided, our goal is to find an equilibrium set of strategies for the agents. 2.1 Strategy Structure Recall that each agent declines partnerships based on (a) the partnerships immediate utility in comparison to the agents expected utility from resuming search; and (b) achieving a mutual commitment (thus declining pending partnerships that were not rejected in (a)).",
                "Therefore an agents strategy can be represented by a pair (Nt , xt ) where Nt is the number of agents with whom it chooses to interact in search stage t and xt is its reservation value5 (a threshold) for accepting/rejecting the resulting N potential partnerships.",

                "The twosided nature of the search suggests that a <br>partnership</br> between a pair of agents is formed only if it is mutually accepted.",

                "For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21].",
                "Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",
                "However, the agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their decision making process.",

                "This leads to a sequential decision making process by which each agent, upon sending a commit message to one of the other agents, delays its decision concerning a commitment or rejection of all other potential partnerships until receiving a response from that agent (i.e., the agent still maintains parallel interactions in each search stage, except that its decision making process at the end of the stage is sequential rather than instantaneous).",
                "The new model is a much more realistic pairwise model and, as we show in the analysis section, is always preferred by any single agents participating in the process.",

                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",
                "This model is a general search model which can be applied in various (not necessarily software agents-based) domains.",
                "Second, we prove that the agents SDM strategy weakly dominates the I-DM strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the S-DM strategy when all other agents are using the I-DM strategy.",
                "Finally, by using an innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of different potential partnerships, we identify unique characteristics of the equilibrium strategies in the new model.",
                "These are used for supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the calculation of the agents equilibrium strategy.",
                "This latter contribution is 2 The term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for maintaining its search, such as: self advertisement, locating other agents, communicating with them and processing their offers. of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).",
                "We manage to extract the agents new equilibrium strategies without increasing the computational complexity in comparison to the I-DM model.",

                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",

                "While AI search is an active process in which an agent finds a sequence of actions that will bring it from the initial state to a goal state, economic search refers to the identification of the best agent to commit to a partnership with. and the two interact bilaterally in order to learn the benefit encapsulated in a partnership between them.",

                "The twosided nature of the search suggests that a partnership between a pair of agents is formed only if it is mutually accepted.",

                "For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21].",
                "Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",
                "However, the agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their decision making process.",
                "Thus each agent, upon reviewing the opportunities available in a specific search stage, has to notify all other agents of its decision whether to commit to a partnership (at most with one of them) or reject the partnership (with the rest of them).",

                "This leads to a sequential decision making process by which each agent, upon sending a commit message to one of the other agents, delays its decision concerning a commitment or rejection of all other potential partnerships until receiving a response from that agent (i.e., the agent still maintains parallel interactions in each search stage, except that its decision making process at the end of the stage is sequential rather than instantaneous).",

                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",

                "The decision of rejecting a partnership in step 6 is based only on the immediate utility that can be gained from this partnership in comparison to the expected utility of resuming the search (i.e., moving on to the next search stage) and is not affected by the willingness of the other agents to commit or reject a partnership with Ai.",
                "As for partnerships that yield a utility greater than the expected utility of resuming the search (i.e., the partnerships with agents from the set A∗ ), the agent always prefers to delay its decision concerning partnerships of this type until receiving all notifications concerning potential partnerships that are associated with a greater immediate utility.",

                "An immediate derivative from the above lemma is that no tiebreaking procedures are required and an agent in a waiting state is always waiting for a reply from the single agent that is associated with the highest utility among the agents in the set A∗ (i.e., no other agent in the set A∗ is associated with an equal utility).",
                "A deadlock can be formed only if we can create a cyclic sequence of agents in which any agent is waiting for a reply from the subsequent agent in the sequence.",
                "However, in our method any agent Ai will be waiting for a reply from another agent Aj, to which it sent a commit message, only if: (1) any agent Ak ∈ A, associated with a utility U(Ai, Ak) > U(Ai, Aj), has already rejected the partnership with agent Ai; and (2) agent Aj itself is waiting for a reply from agent Al where U(Al, Aj) > U(Aj, Ai).",

                "Since the search process is two-sided, our goal is to find an equilibrium set of strategies for the agents. 2.1 Strategy Structure Recall that each agent declines partnerships based on (a) the partnerships immediate utility in comparison to the agents expected utility from resuming search; and (b) achieving a mutual commitment (thus declining pending partnerships that were not rejected in (a)).",

                "Twosided agents-based search can also be found in applications of buyers and sellers in eMarkets and peer-to-peer applications.",
                "The twosided nature of the search suggests that a partnership between a pair of agents is formed only if it is mutually accepted.",

                "Other examples are the scenario where students need to form pairs for working together on an assignment, for which both partners share the same grade, and the scenario where two buyer agents interested in similar or interchangeable products join forces to buy a product together, taking advantage of discount for quantity (i.e. each of them enjoys the same reduced price).",

                "For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21].",
                "Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",
                "However, the agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their decision making process.",
                "Thus each agent, upon reviewing the opportunities available in a specific search stage, has to notify all other agents of its decision whether to commit to a partnership (at most with one of them) or reject the partnership (with the rest of them).",
                "This inherent restriction imposes a significant limitation on the agents strategic behavior.",

                "The asynchronous approach allows the agents to re-evaluate their strategy, based on each new response they receive from the agents they interact with.",
                "This leads to a sequential decision making process by which each agent, upon sending a commit message to one of the other agents, delays its decision concerning a commitment or rejection of all other potential partnerships until receiving a response from that agent (i.e., the agent still maintains parallel interactions in each search stage, except that its decision making process at the end of the stage is sequential rather than instantaneous).",
                "The new model is a much more realistic pairwise model and, as we show in the analysis section, is always preferred by any single agents participating in the process.",

                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",
                "This model is a general search model which can be applied in various (not necessarily software agents-based) domains.",
                "Second, we prove that the agents SDM strategy weakly dominates the I-DM strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the S-DM strategy when all other agents are using the I-DM strategy.",
                "Finally, by using an innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of different potential partnerships, we identify unique characteristics of the equilibrium strategies in the new model.",
                "These are used for supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the calculation of the agents equilibrium strategy.",
                "This latter contribution is 2 The term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for maintaining its search, such as: self advertisement, locating other agents, communicating with them and processing their offers. of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).",
                "We manage to extract the agents new equilibrium strategies without increasing the computational complexity in comparison to the I-DM model.",

                "The decision of rejecting a partnership in step 6 is based only on the immediate utility that can be gained from this partnership in comparison to the expected utility of resuming the search (i.e., moving on to the next search stage) and is not affected by the willingness of the other agents to commit or reject a partnership with Ai.",
                "As for partnerships that yield a utility greater than the expected utility of resuming the search (i.e., the partnerships with agents from the set A∗ ), the agent always prefers to delay its decision concerning partnerships of this type until receiving all notifications concerning potential partnerships that are associated with a greater immediate utility.",
                "The delay never results with a loss of opportunity since the other agents decision concerning this opportunity is not affected by agent Ais willingness to commit or reject this opportunity (but rather by the other agents estimation of its expected utility if resuming the search and the rejection messages it receives for more beneficial potential partnerships).",
                "Finally, the agent cannot benefit from delaying a commit message to the agent associated with the highest utility in A∗ , thus will always send it a commit message. (b) We first prove the following lemma that states that the probability of having two partnering opportunities associated with an identical utility is zero.",

                "Various centralized matching mechanisms can be found in the literature [6, 2, 8].",
                "However, in many MAS environments, in the absence of any reliable central matching mechanism, the matching process is completely distributed.",
                "While the search in agent-based environments is well recognized to be costly [11, 21, 1], most of the proposed coalition formation mechanisms assume that an agent can scan as many partnership opportunities in its environment as needed or have access to central matchers or middle agents [6].",
                "The incorporation of costly search in this context is quite rare [21] and to the best of our knowledge, a distributed two-sided search for partners model similar to the S-DM model has not been studied to date.",
                "Classical economic search theory ([15, 17], and references therein) widely addresses the problem of a searcher operating in a costly environment, seeking to maximize his long term utility.",
                "In these models, classified as one-sided search, the focus is on establishing the optimal strategies for the searcher, assuming no mutual search activities (i.e., no influence on the environment).",
                "Here the sequential search procedure is often applied, allowing the searcher to investigate a single [15] or multiple [7, 19] opportunities at a time.",
                "While the latter method is proven to be beneficial for the searcher, it was never used in the two-sided search models that followed (where dual search activities are modeled) [22, 5, 18].",
                "Therefore, in these models, the equilibrium strategies are always developed based on the assumption that the agents interact with others sequentially (i.e., with one agent at a time).",
                "A first attempt to integrate the parallel search into a two-sided search model is given in [21], as detailed in the introduction section.",
                "Several of the two-sided search essences can be found in the strategic theory of bargaining [3] - both coalition formation and matching can be represented as a sequential bargaining game [4] in which payoffs are defined as a function of the coalition structure and can be divided according to a fixed or negotiated division rule.",
                "Nevertheless, in the sequential bargaining literature, most emphasis is put on specifying the details of the sequential negotiating process over the division of the utility (or cost) jointly owned by parties or the strategy the coalition needs to adopt [20, 4].",
                "The models presented in this area do not associate the coalition formation process with search costs, which is the essence of the analysis that economic search theory aims to supply.",

                "The only problem that may arise in the transition from an instantaneous to sequential decision making is when an agent fails (technically) to function (endlessly delaying the notification to the agents it interacted with).",
                "While equilibrium analysis normally do not consider malfunction as a legitimate strategy, we do wish to emphasize that the malfunctioning agent problem can be resolved by using a simple timeout for receiving responses and skipping this agent in the sequential decision process if the timeout is exceeded.",

                "Our capabilities to produce an upper bound for the number of parallel interactions used in equilibrium (Theorem 4) and to quickly identify (and eliminate) non-equilibrium strategies (Theorem 3) resolves the problem of the computational complexity associated with having to deal with a theoretically infinite strategy space.",
                "While the analysis we present is given in the context of software agents, the model we suggest is general, and can be applied to any two-sided economic search environment where the searchers can search in parallel.",
                "In particular, in addition to weakly dominating the <br>instantaneous decision making</br> model (as we prove in the analysis section) the proposed method weakly dominates the purely sequential two-sided search model (where each agent interacts with only one other agent at a time) [5].",
                "This derives from the fact that the proposed method is a generalization of the latter (i.e., in the worst case scenario, the agent can interact with one other agent at a time in parallel).",

                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",

                "The only problem that may arise in the transition from an instantaneous to <br>sequential decision making</br> is when an agent fails (technically) to function (endlessly delaying the notification to the agents it interacted with).",
                "While equilibrium analysis normally do not consider malfunction as a legitimate strategy, we do wish to emphasize that the malfunctioning agent problem can be resolved by using a simple timeout for receiving responses and skipping this agent in the sequential decision process if the timeout is exceeded.",

                "In particular, in addition to weakly dominating the instantaneous decision making model (as we prove in the analysis section) the proposed method weakly dominates the purely sequential two-sided search model (where each agent interacts with only one other agent at a time) [5].",
                "This derives from the fact that the proposed method is a generalization of the latter (i.e., in the worst case scenario, the agent can interact with one other agent at a time in parallel).",

                "The interaction does not involve bargaining thus each agent merely needs to choose between accepting or rejecting the partnership with the other agent.",
                "A typical market where this kind of <br>two-sided search</br> takes place is the marriage market [22].",
                "Recent literature suggests various software agent-based applications where a two-sided distributed (i.e., with no centralized matching mechanisms) search takes place.",
                "An important class of such applications includes secondary markets for exchanging unexploited resources.",
                "An exchange mechanism is used in those cases where selling these resources is not the core business of the organization or when the overhead for selling them makes it non-beneficial.",
                "For example, through a twosided search, agents, representing different service providers, can exchange unused bandwidth [21] and communication satellites can transfer communication with a greater geographical coverage.",
                "Twosided agents-based search can also be found in applications of buyers and sellers in eMarkets and peer-to-peer applications.",
                "The twosided nature of the search suggests that a partnership between a pair of agents is formed only if it is mutually accepted.",
                "By forming a partnership the agents gain an immediate utility and terminate their search.",
                "When resuming the search, on the other hand, a more suitable partner might be found however some resources will need to be consumed for maintaining the search process.",
                "In this paper we focus on a specific class of <br>two-sided search</br> matching problems, in which the performance of the partnership applies to both parties, i.e., both gain an equal utility [13].",
                "The equal utility scenario is usually applicable in domains where the partners gain from the synergy between them.",
                "For example, consider tennis players that seek partners when playing doubles (or a canoes paddler looking for a partner to practice with).",
                "Here the players are being rewarded completely based on the teams (rather than the individual) performance.",
                "Other examples are the scenario where students need to form pairs for working together on an assignment, for which both partners share the same grade, and the scenario where two buyer agents interested in similar or interchangeable products join forces to buy a product together, taking advantage of discount for quantity (i.e. each of them enjoys the same reduced price).",
                "In all these applications, any two agents can form a partnership and the performance of any given partnership depends on the skills or the characteristics of its members.",
                "Furthermore, the equal utility scenario can also hold whenever there is an option for side-payments and the partnerships overall utility is equally split among the two agents forming it [22].",
                "While the <br>two-sided search</br> literature offers comprehensive equilibrium analysis for various models, it assumes that the agents search is conducted in a purely sequential manner: each agent locates and interacts with one other agent in its environment at a time 450 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS [5, 22].",
                "Nevertheless, when the search is assigned to autonomous software agents a better search strategy can be used.",
                "Here an agent can take advantage of its unique inherent filtering and information processing capabilities and its ability to efficiently (in comparison to people) maintain concurrent interactions with several other agents at each stage of its search.",
                "Such use of parallel interactions in search is favorable whenever the average cost2 per interaction with another agent, when interacting in parallel with a batch of other agents, is smaller than the cost of maintaining one interaction at a time (i.e., advantage to size).",
                "For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21].",
                "Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",
                "However, the agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their decision making process.",
                "Thus each agent, upon reviewing the opportunities available in a specific search stage, has to notify all other agents of its decision whether to commit to a partnership (at most with one of them) or reject the partnership (with the rest of them).",
                "This inherent restriction imposes a significant limitation on the agents strategic behavior.",
                "In our model, the agents are free to notify the other agents of their decisions in an asynchronous manner.",
                "The asynchronous approach allows the agents to re-evaluate their strategy, based on each new response they receive from the agents they interact with.",
                "This leads to a sequential decision making process by which each agent, upon sending a commit message to one of the other agents, delays its decision concerning a commitment or rejection of all other potential partnerships until receiving a response from that agent (i.e., the agent still maintains parallel interactions in each search stage, except that its decision making process at the end of the stage is sequential rather than instantaneous).",
                "The new model is a much more realistic pairwise model and, as we show in the analysis section, is always preferred by any single agents participating in the process.",
                "In the absence of other economic two-sided parallel search models, we use the model that relies on an instantaneous (synchronous) decision making process [21] (denoted I-DM throughout the rest of the paper) as a benchmark for evaluating the usefulness of our proposed sequential (asynchronous) decision making strategy (denoted S-DM).",
                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a <br>two-sided search</br> process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",
                "This model is a general search model which can be applied in various (not necessarily software agents-based) domains.",
                "Second, we prove that the agents SDM strategy weakly dominates the I-DM strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the S-DM strategy when all other agents are using the I-DM strategy.",
                "Finally, by using an innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of different potential partnerships, we identify unique characteristics of the equilibrium strategies in the new model.",
                "These are used for supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the calculation of the agents equilibrium strategy.",
                "This latter contribution is 2 The term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for maintaining its search, such as: self advertisement, locating other agents, communicating with them and processing their offers. of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).",
                "We manage to extract the agents new equilibrium strategies without increasing the computational complexity in comparison to the I-DM model.",
                "Throughout the paper we demonstrate the different properties of the new model and compare it with the I-DM model using an artificial synthetic environment.",
                "In the following section we formally present the S-DM model.",
                "An equilibrium analysis and computational means for finding the equilibrium strategy are provided in Section 3.",

                "Therefore, the only way by which an agent Ai can learn the value of a partnership with another agent Aj, U(Ai, Aj), is by interacting with agent Aj.",
                "Since each agent in <br>two-sided search</br> models has no prior information concerning any of the other agents in its environment, it initiates interactions (i.e., search) with other agents randomly.",
                "The nature of the <br>two-sided search</br> application suggests that the agents are satisfied with having a single partner, thus once a partnership is formed the two agents forming it terminate their search process and leave the environment.",

                "Based on the learned values, the agent needs to decide whether to commit or reject each of the potential partnerships available to it.",
                "Commitment is achieved by sending a commit message to the appropriate agent and an agent cannot commit to more than one potential partnership simultaneously.",

                "In many domains (e.g., eCommerce) this derives from the high entrance and leave rates, thus the probability of running into the same agent in a random match is negligible. 4 Notice that the asynchronous procedure does not eliminate the inherent structure of the search.",

                "The method differs from the one used in the I-DM model in the way it handles the commitment messages: in the I-DM model, after evaluating the set of utilities (step 4), the agent merely sends instantaneously a commit message to the agent associated with the greatest utility and a reject message to all the other agents it interacted with (as a replacement to steps 5-15 in the above procedure).",
                "Our proposed S-DM model is much more intuitive as it allows an agent to hold and possibly exploit relatively beneficial opportunities even if its first priority partnership is rejected by the other agent.",

                "As for partnerships that yield a utility greater than the expected utility of resuming the search (i.e., the partnerships with agents from the set A∗ ), the agent always prefers to delay its decision concerning partnerships of this type until receiving all notifications concerning potential partnerships that are associated with a greater immediate utility.",

                "Twosided agents-based search can also be found in applications of buyers and sellers in eMarkets and peer-to-peer applications.",
                "The twosided nature of the search suggests that a partnership between a pair of agents is formed only if it is mutually accepted.",

                "For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21].",
                "Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",
                "However, the agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their decision making process.",
                "Thus each agent, upon reviewing the opportunities available in a specific search stage, has to notify all other agents of its decision whether to commit to a partnership (at most with one of them) or reject the partnership (with the rest of them).",

                "This leads to a sequential decision making process by which each agent, upon sending a commit message to one of the other agents, delays its decision concerning a commitment or rejection of all other potential partnerships until receiving a response from that agent (i.e., the agent still maintains parallel interactions in each search stage, except that its decision making process at the end of the stage is sequential rather than instantaneous).",
                "The new model is a much more realistic pairwise model and, as we show in the analysis section, is always preferred by any single agents participating in the process.",

                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",
                "This model is a general search model which can be applied in various (not necessarily software agents-based) domains.",
                "Second, we prove that the agents SDM strategy weakly dominates the I-DM strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the S-DM strategy when all other agents are using the I-DM strategy.",
                "Finally, by using an innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of different potential partnerships, we identify unique characteristics of the equilibrium strategies in the new model.",
                "These are used for supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the calculation of the agents equilibrium strategy.",
                "This latter contribution is 2 The term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for maintaining its search, such as: self advertisement, locating other agents, communicating with them and processing their offers. of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).",
                "We manage to extract the agents new equilibrium strategies without increasing the computational complexity in comparison to the I-DM model.",

                "While coalition formation models usually consider general coalition-sizes [24], the partnership formation model (often referred as matchmaking) considers environments where agents have a benefit only when forming a partnership and this benefit can not be improved by extending the partnership to more than two agents [12, 23] (e.g., in the case of buyers and sellers or peer-to-peer applications).",

                "While the analysis we present is given in the context of software agents, the model we suggest is general, and can be applied to any two-sided economic search environment where the searchers can search in parallel.",
                "In particular, in addition to weakly dominating the instantaneous decision making model (as we prove in the analysis section) the proposed method weakly dominates the purely sequential two-sided search model (where each agent interacts with only one other agent at a time) [5].",
                "This derives from the fact that the proposed method is a generalization of the latter (i.e., in the worst case scenario, the agent can interact with one other agent at a time in parallel).",

                "For example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21].",
                "Despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].",

                "The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).",
                "This model is a general search model which can be applied in various (not necessarily software agents-based) domains.",
                "Second, we prove that the agents SDM strategy weakly dominates the I-DM strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the S-DM strategy when all other agents are using the I-DM strategy.",
                "Finally, by using an innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of different potential partnerships, we identify unique characteristics of the equilibrium strategies in the new model.",
                "These are used for supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the calculation of the agents equilibrium strategy.",
                "This latter contribution is 2 The term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for maintaining its search, such as: self advertisement, locating other agents, communicating with them and processing their offers. of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).",
                "We manage to extract the agents new equilibrium strategies without increasing the computational complexity in comparison to the I-DM model.",

                "While coalition formation models usually consider general coalition-sizes [24], the partnership formation model (often referred as matchmaking) considers environments where agents have a benefit only when forming a partnership and this benefit can not be improved by extending the partnership to more than two agents [12, 23] (e.g., in the case of buyers and sellers or peer-to-peer applications).",

                "While the latter method is proven to be beneficial for the searcher, it was never used in the two-sided search models that followed (where dual search activities are modeled) [22, 5, 18].",

                "Nevertheless, in the sequential bargaining literature, most emphasis is put on specifying the details of the sequential negotiating process over the division of the utility (or cost) jointly owned by parties or the strategy the coalition needs to adopt [20, 4].",

                "The only problem that may arise in the transition from an instantaneous to sequential decision making is when an agent fails (technically) to function (endlessly delaying the notification to the agents it interacted with).",

                "In particular, in addition to weakly dominating the instantaneous decision making model (as we prove in the analysis section) the proposed method weakly dominates the purely sequential two-sided search model (where each agent interacts with only one other agent at a time) [5].",
                "This derives from the fact that the proposed method is a generalization of the latter (i.e., in the worst case scenario, the agent can interact with one other agent at a time in parallel).",
