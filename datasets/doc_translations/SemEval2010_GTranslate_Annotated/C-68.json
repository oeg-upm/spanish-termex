Our target environment uses data carriers, termed zebroids, where a mobile device carries a data item on behalf of a server to a client thereby minimizing its availability latency. In this study, we quantify the variation in availability latency with zebroids as a function of a rich set of parameters such as car density, storage per device, repository size, and replacement policies employed by zebroids. Using analysis and extensive simulations, we gain novel insights into the design of carrier-based systems. Significant improvements in latency can be obtained with zebroids at the cost of a minimal overhead. These improvements occur even in scenarios with lower accuracy in the predictions of the car routes. Two particularly surprising findings are: (1) a naive random replacement policy employed by the zebroids shows competitive performance, and (2) latency improvements obtained with a simplified instantiation of zebroids are found to be robust to changes in the popularity distribution of the data items.

INTRODUCTION Technological advances in areas of storage and wireless communications have now made it feasible to envision on-demand delivery of data items, for e.g., video and audio clips, in vehicular peer-topeer networks. In prior work, Ghandeharizadeh et al. [10] introduce the concept of vehicles equipped with a Car-to-Car-Peer-toPeer device, termed AutoMata, for in-vehicle entertainment. The notable features of an AutoMata include a mass storage device offering hundreds of gigabytes (GB) of storage, a fast processor, and several types of networking cards. Even with todays 500 GB disk drives, a repository of diverse entertainment content may exceed the storage capacity of a single AutoMata. Such repositories constitute the focus of this study. To exchange data, we assume each AutoMata is configured with two types of networking cards: 1) a low-bandwidth networking card with a long radio-range in the order of miles that enables an AutoMata device to communicate with a nearby cellular or WiMax station, 2) a high-bandwidth networking card with a limited radio-range in the order of hundreds of feet. The high bandwidth connection supports data rates in the order of tens to hundreds of Megabits per second and represents the ad-hoc peer to peer network between the vehicles. This is labelled as the data plane and is employed to exchange data items between devices. The low-bandwidth connection serves as the control plane, enabling AutoMata devices to exchange meta-data with one or more centralized servers. This connection offers bandwidths in the order of tens to hundreds of Kilobits per second. The centralized servers, termed dispatchers, compute schedules of data delivery along the data plane using the provided meta-data. These schedules are transmitted to the participating vehicles using the control plane. The technical feasibility of such a two-tier architecture is presented in [7], with preliminary results to demonstrate the bandwidth of the control plane is sufficient for exchange of control information needed for realizing such an application. In a typical scenario, an AutoMata device presents a passenger with a list of data items1 , showing both the name of each data item and its availability latency. The latter, denoted as δ, is defined as the earliest time at which the client encounters a copy of its requested data item. A data item is available immediately when it resides in the local storage of the AutoMata device serving the request. Due to storage constraints, an AutoMata may not store the entire repository. In this case, availability latency is the time from when the user issues a request until when the AutoMata encounters another car containing the referenced data item. (The terms car and AutoMata are used interchangeably in this study.) The availability latency for an item is a function of the current location of the client, its destination and travel path, the mobility model of the AutoMata equipped vehicles, the number of replicas constructed for the different data items, and the placement of data item replicas across the vehicles. A method to improve the availability latency is to employ data carriers which transport a replica of the requested data item from a server car containing it to a client that requested it. These data carriers are termed zebroids. Selection of zebroids is facilitated by the two-tiered architecture. The control plane enables centralized information gathering at a dispatcher present at a base-station.2 Some examples of control in1 Without loss of generality, the term data item might be either traditional media such as text or continuous media such as an audio or video clip. 2 There may be dispatchers deployed at a subset of the base-stations for fault-tolerance and robustness. Dispatchers between basestations may communicate via the wired infrastructure. 75 formation are currently active requests, travel path of the clients and their destinations, and paths of the other cars. For each client request, the dispatcher may choose a set of z carriers that collaborate to transfer a data item from a server to a client (z-relay zebroids). Here, z is the number of zebroids such that 0 ≤ z < N, where N is the total number of cars. When z = 0 there are no carriers, requiring a server to deliver the data item directly to the client. Otherwise, the chosen relay team of z zebroids hand over the data item transitively to one another to arrive at the client, thereby reducing availability latency (see Section 3.1 for details). To increase robustness, the dispatcher may employ multiple relay teams of z-carriers for every request. This may be useful in scenarios where the dispatcher has lower prediction accuracy in the information about the routes of the cars. Finally, storage constraints may require a zebroid to evict existing data items from its local storage to accommodate the client requested item. In this study, we quantify the following main factors that affect availability latency in the presence of zebroids: (i) data item repository size, (ii) car density, (iii) storage capacity per car, (iv) client trip duration, (v) replacement scheme employed by the zebroids, and (vi) accuracy of the car route predictions. For a significant subset of these factors, we address some key questions pertaining to use of zebroids both via analysis and extensive simulations. Our main findings are as follows. A naive random replacement policy employed by the zebroids shows competitive performance in terms of availability latency. With such a policy, substantial improvements in latency can be obtained with zebroids at a minimal replacement overhead. In more practical scenarios, where the dispatcher has inaccurate information about the car routes, zebroids continue to provide latency improvements. A surprising result is that changes in popularity of the data items do not impact the latency gains obtained with a simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids called one-instantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1). This study suggests a number of interesting directions to be pursued to gain better understanding of design of carrier-based systems that improve availability latency. Related Work: Replication in mobile ad-hoc networks has been a widely studied topic [11, 12, 15]. However, none of these studies employ zebroids as data carriers to reduce the latency of the clients requests. Several novel and important studies such as ZebraNet [13], DakNet [14], Data Mules [16], Message Ferries [20], and Seek and Focus [17] have analyzed factors impacting intermittently connected networks consisting of data carriers similar in spirit to zebroids. Factors considered by each study are dictated by their assumed environment and target application. A novel characteristic of our study is the impact on availability latency for a given database repository of items. A detailed description of related works can be obtained in [9]. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the terminology along with the factors that impact availability latency in the presence of zebroids. Section 3 describes how the zebroids may be employed. Section 4 provides details of the analysis methodology employed to capture the performance with zebroids. Section 5 describes the details of the simulation environment used for evaluation. Section 6 enlists the key questions examined in this study and answers them via analysis and simulations. Finally, Section 7 presents brief conclusions and future research directions. 2. OVERVIEW AND TERMINOLOGY Table 1 summarizes the notation of the parameters used in the paper. Below we introduce some terminology used in the paper. Assume a network of N AutoMata-equipped cars, each with storage capacity of α bytes. The total storage capacity of the system is ST =N ·α. There are T data items in the database, each with Database Parameters T Number of data items. Si Size of data item i fi Frequency of access to data item i. Replication Parameters Ri Normalized frequency of access to data item i ri Number of replicas for data item i n Characterizes a particular replication scheme. δi Average availability latency of data item i δagg Aggregate availability latency, δagg = T j=1 δj · fj AutoMata System Parameters G Number of cells in the map (2D-torus). N Number of AutoMata devices in the system. α Storage capacity per AutoMata. γ Trip duration of the client AutoMata. ST Total storage capacity of the AutoMata system, ST = N · α. Table 1: Terms and their definitions size Si. The frequency of access to data item i is denoted as fi, with T j=1 fj = 1. Let the trip duration of the client AutoMata under consideration be γ. We now define the normalized frequency of access to the data item i, denoted by Ri, as: Ri = (fi)n T j=1(fj)n ; 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞ (1) The exponent n characterizes a particular replication technique. A square-root replication scheme is realized when n = 0.5 [5]. This serves as the base-line for comparison with the case when zebroids are deployed. Ri is normalized to a value between 0 and 1. The number of replicas for data item i, denoted as ri, is: ri = min (N, max (1, Ri·N·α Si )). This captures the case when at least one copy of every data item must be present in the ad-hoc network at all times. In cases where a data item may be lost from the ad-hoc network, this equation becomes ri = min (N, max (0, Ri·N·α Si )). In this case, a request for the lost data item may need to be satisfied by fetching the item from a remote server. The availability latency for a data item i, denoted as δi, is defined as the earliest time at which a client AutoMata will find the first replica of the item accessible to it. If this condition is not satisfied, then we set δi to γ. This indicates that data item i was not available to the client during its journey. Note that since there is at least one replica in the system for every data item i, by setting γ to a large value we ensure that the clients request for any data item i will be satisfied. However, in most practical circumstances γ may not be so large as to find every data item. We are interested in the availability latency observed across all data items. Hence, we augment the average availability latency for every data item i with its fi to obtain the following weighted availability latency (δagg) metric: δagg = T i=1 δi · fi Next, we present our solution approach describing how zebroids are selected. 3. SOLUTION APPROACH 3.1 Zebroids When a client references a data item missing from its local storage, the dispatcher identifies all cars with a copy of the data item as servers. Next, the dispatcher obtains the future routes of all cars for a finite time duration equivalent to the maximum time the client is willing to wait for its request to be serviced. Using this information, the dispatcher schedules the quickest delivery path from any of the servers to the client using any other cars as intermediate carriers. Hence, it determines the optimal set of forwarding decisions 76 that will enable the data item to be delivered to the client in the minimum amount of time. Note that the latency along the quickest delivery path that employs a relay team of z zebroids is similar to that obtained with epidemic routing [19] under the assumptions of infinite storage and no interference. A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the clients request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity. Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid. In some cases, the dispatcher might have inaccurate information about the routes of the cars. Hence, a zebroid scheduled on the basis of this inaccurate information may not rendezvous with its target client. To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids. This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements. The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth. With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane. Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner. This remains a future research direction. Initially, number of replicas for each data item replicas might be computed using Equation 1. This scheme computes the number of data item replicas as a function of their popularity. It is static because number of replicas in the system do not change and no replacements are performed. Hence, this is referred to as the nozebroids environment. We quantify the performance of the various replacement policies with reference to this base-line that does not employ zebroids. One may assume a cold start phase, where initially only one or few copies of every data item exist in the system. Many storage slots of the cars may be unoccupied. When the cars encounter one another they construct new replicas of some selected data items to occupy the empty slots. The selection procedure may be to choose the data items uniformly at random. New replicas are created as long as a car has a certain threshold of its storage unoccupied. Eventually, majority of the storage capacity of a car will be exhausted. 3.2 Carrier-based Replacement policies The replacement policies considered in this paper are reactive since a replacement occurs only in response to a request issued for a certain data item. When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item. For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction. This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18]. The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random). We have considered local and global variants of the LRU/LFU policies which determine whether local or global knowledge of contents of the cars known at the dispatcher is used for the eviction decision at a zebroid (see [9] for more details). The replacement policies incur the following overheads. First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy. Second, the bandwidth used to transfer a copy of a data item from a server to the zebroid. Third, the average number of replacements incurred by the zebroids. Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred. The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids. Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system. In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times. In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4. ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids. First, we present some preliminaries of our analysis methodology. • Let N be the number of cars in the network performing a 2D random walk on a √ G× √ G torus. An additional car serves as a client yielding a total of N + 1 cars. Such a mobility model has been used widely in the literature [17, 16] chiefly because it is amenable to analysis and provides a baseline against which performance of other mobility models can be compared. Moreover, this class of Markovian mobility models has been used to model the movements of vehicles [3, 21]. • We assume that all cars start from the stationary distribution and perform independent random walks. Although for sparse density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it is no longer valid when N approaches G. • Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also, data item i has ri replicas. This implies ri cars, identified as servers, have a copy of this data item when the client requests item i. All analysis results presented in this section are obtained assuming that the client is willing to wait as long as it takes for its request to be satisfied (unbounded trip duration γ = ∞). With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2]. Extensions to the analysis that also consider finite trip durations can be obtained in [9]. Consider a scenario where no zebroids are employed. In this case, the expected availability latency for the data item is the expected meeting time of the random walk undertaken by the client with any of the random walks performed by the servers. Aldous et al. [2] show that the the meeting time of two random walks in such a setting can be modelled as an exponential distribution with the mean C = c · G · log G, where the constant c 0.17 for G ≥ 25. The meeting time, or equivalently the availability latency δi, for the client requesting data item i is the time till it encounters any of these ri replicas for the first time. This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value (note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G >> ri): δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items, weighted by their frequency of access: δagg(no − zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri = T i=1 fi · C ri (2) 77 4.1 One-instantaneous zebroids Recall that with one-instantaneous zebroids, for a given request, a new replica is created on a car in the vicinity of the server, provided this car meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers. Moreover, this replica is spawned at the time step when the client issues the request. Let Nc i be the expected total number of nodes that are in the same cell as any of the ri servers. Then, we have Nc i = (N − ri) · (1 − (1 − 1 G )ri ) (3) In the analytical model, we assume that Nc i new replicas are created, so that the total number of replicas is increased to ri +Nc i . The availability latency is reduced since the client is more likely to meet a replica earlier. The aggregated expected availability latency in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers). It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers. As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client. It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1). Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server. This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17]. Details of the procedure to obtain a closed-form expression are given in [9]. The aggregate availability latency (δagg) with z-relay zebroids is given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 [fi · C N + 1 · 1 N + 1 − ri · (N · log N ri − log (N + 1 − ri))] (5) 5. SIMULATION METHODOLOGY The simulation environment considered in this study comprises of vehicles such as cars that carry a fraction of the data item repository. A prediction accuracy parameter inherently provides a certain probabilistic guarantee on the confidence of the car route predictions known at the dispatcher. A value of 100% implies that the exact routes of all cars are known at all times. A 70% value for this parameter indicates that the routes predicted for the cars will match the actual ones with probability 0.7. Note that this probability is spread across the car routes for the entire trip duration. We now provide the preliminaries of the simulation study and then describe the parameter settings used in our experiments. • Similar to the analysis methodology, the map used is a 2D torus. A Markov mobility model representing a unbiased 2D random walk on the surface of the torus describes the movement of the cars across this torus. • Each grid/cell is a unique state of this Markov chain. In each time slot, every car makes a transition from a cell to any of its neighboring 8 cells. The transition is a function of the current location of the car and a probability transition matrix Q = [qij] where qij is the probability of transition from state i to state j. Only AutoMata equipped cars within the same cell may communicate with each other. • The parameters γ, δ have been discretized and expressed in terms of the number of time slots. • An AutoMata device does not maintain more than one replica of a data item. This is because additional replicas occupy storage without providing benefits. • Either one-instantaneous or z-relay zebroids may be employed per client request for latency improvement. • Unless otherwise mentioned, the prediction accuracy parameter is assumed to be 100%. This is because this study aims to quantify the effect of a large number of parameters individually on availability latency. Here, we set the size of every data item, Si, to be 1. α represents the number of storage slots per AutoMata. Each storage slot stores one data item. γ represents the duration of the clients journey in terms of the number of time slots. Hence the possible values of availability latency are between 0 and γ. δ is defined as the number of time slots after which a client AutoMata device will encounter a replica of the data item for the first time. If a replica for the data item requested was encountered by the client in the first cell then we set δ = 0. If δ > γ then we set δ = γ indicating that no copy of the requested data item was encountered by the client during its entire journey. In all our simulations, for illustration we consider a 5 × 5 2D-torus with γ set to 10. Our experiments indicate that the trends in the results scale to maps of larger size. We simulated a skewed distribution of access to the T data items that obeys Zipfs law with a mean of 0.27. This distribution is shown to correspond to sale of movie theater tickets in the United States [6]. We employ a replication scheme that allocates replicas for a data item as a function of the square-root of the frequency of access of that item. The square-root replication scheme is shown to have competitive latency performance over a large parameter space [8]. The data item replicas are distributed uniformly across the AutoMata devices. This serves as the base-line no-zebroids case. The square-root scheme also provides the initial replica distribution when zebroids are employed. Note that the replacements performed by the zebroids will cause changes to the data item replica distribution. Requests generated as per the Zipf distribution are issued one at a time. The client car that issues the request is chosen in a round-robin manner. After a maximum period of γ, the latency encountered by this request is recorded. In all the simulation results, each point is an average of 200,000 requests. Moreover, the 95% confidence intervals determined for the results are quite tight for the metrics of latency and replacement overhead. Hence, we only present them for the metric that captures the percentage improvement in latency with respect to the no-zebroids case. 6. RESULTS In this section, we describe our evaluation results where the following key questions are addressed.

What is the associated overhead incurred in employing these zebroids? What happens to these improvements in scenarios where a dispatcher may have imperfect information about the car routes? What inherent trade-offs exist between car density and storage per car with regards to their combined as well as individual effect on availability latency in the presence of zebroids? We present both simple analysis and detailed simulations to provide answers to these questions as well as gain insights into design of carrier-based systems. 6.1 How does a replacement scheme employed by a zebroid impact availability latency? For illustration, we present scale-up experiments where oneinstantaneous zebroids are employed (see Figure 1). By scale-up, we mean that α and N are changed proportionally to keep the total system storage, ST , constant. Here, T = 50 and ST = 200. We choose the following values of (N,α) = {(20,10), (25,8), (50,4), (100,2)}. The figure indicates that a random replacement scheme shows competitive performance. This is because of several reasons. Recall that the initial replica distribution is set as per the squareroot replication scheme. The random replacement scheme does not alter this distribution since it makes replacements blind to the popularity of a data item. However, the replacements cause dynamic data re-organization so as to better serve the currently active request. Moreover, the mobility pattern of the cars is random, hence, the locations from which the requests are issued by clients are also random and not known a priori at the dispatcher. These findings are significant because a random replacement policy can be implemented in a simple decentralized manner. The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random. This is because these policies rapidly develop a preference for the more popular data items thereby creating a larger number of replicas for them. During eviction, the more popular data items are almost never selected as a replacement candidate. Consequently, there are fewer replicas for the less popular items. Hence, the initial distribution of the data item replicas changes from square-root to that resembling linear replication. The higher number of replicas for the popular data items provide marginal additional benefits, while the lower number of replicas for the other data items hurts the latency performance of these global policies. The lfu-local and lru-local schemes have similar performance to random since they do not have enough history of local data item requests. We speculate that the performance of these local policies will approach that of their global variants for a large enough history of data item requests. On account of the competitive performance shown by a random policy, for the remainder of the paper, we present the performance of zebroids that employ a random replacement policy. 6.2 Do zebroids provide significant improvements in availability latency? We find that in many scenarios employing zebroids provides substantial improvements in availability latency. 6.2.1 Analysis We first consider the case of one-instantaneous zebroids. Figure 2.a shows the variation in δagg as a function of N for T = 10 and α = 1 with a 10 × 10 torus using Equation 4. Both the x and y axes are drawn to a log-scale. Figure 2.b show the % improvement in δagg obtained with one-instantaneous zebroids. In this case, only the x-axis is drawn to a log-scale. For illustration, we assume that the T data items are requested uniformly. Initially, when the network is sparse the analytical approximation for improvements in latency with zebroids, obtained from Equations 2 and 4, closely matches the simulation results. However, as N increases, the sparseness assumption for which the analysis is valid, namely N << G, is no longer true. Hence, the two curves rapidly diverge. The point at which the two curves move away from each other corresponds to a value of δagg ≤ 1. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the analysis provides an upper bound on the latency improvements, as it treats the newly created replicas given by Nc i independently. However, these Nc i replicas start from the same cell as one of the server replicas ri. Finally, the analysis captures a oneshot scenario where given an initial data item replica distribution, the availability latency is computed. The new replicas created do not affect future requests from the client. On account of space limitations, here, we summarize the observations in the case when z-relay zebroids are employed. The interested reader can obtain further details in [9]. Similar observations, like the one-instantaneous zebroid case, apply since the simulation and analysis curves again start diverging when the analysis assumptions are no longer valid. However, the key observation here is that the latency improvement with z-relay zebroids is significantly better than the one-instantaneous zebroids case, especially for lower storage scenarios. This is because in sparse scenarios, the transitive hand-offs between the zebroids creates higher number of replicas for the requested data item, yielding lower availability latency. Moreover, it is also seen that the simulation validation curve for the improvements in δagg with z-relay zebroids approaches that of the one-instantaneous zebroid case for higher storage (higher N values). This is because one-instantaneous zebroids are a special case of z-relay zebroids. 6.2.2 Simulation We conduct simulations to examine the entire storage spectrum obtained by changing car density N or storage per car α to also capture scenarios where the sparseness assumptions for which the analysis is valid do not hold. We separate the effect of N and α by capturing the variation of N while keeping α constant (case 1) and vice-versa (case 2) both with z-relay and one-instantaneous zebroids. Here, we set the repository size as T = 25. Figure 3 captures case 1 mentioned above. Similar trends are observed with case 2, a complete description of those results are available in [9]. With Figure 3.b, keeping α constant, initially increasing car density has higher latency benefits because increasing N introduces more zebroids in the system. As N is further increased, ω reduces because the total storage in the system goes up. Consequently, the number of replicas per data item goes up thereby increasing the 79 number of servers. Hence, the replacement policy cannot find a zebroid as often to transport the requested data item to the client earlier than any of the servers. On the other hand, the increased number of servers benefits the no-zebroids case in bringing δagg down. The net effect results in reduction in ω for larger values of N. 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 Number of cars no−zebroidsanal no−zebroids sim one−instantaneous anal one−instantaneoussim Aggregate Availability latency (δagg ) 2.a) δagg 10 1 10 2 10 3 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Number of cars % Improvement in δagg wrt no−zebroids (ω) analytical upper−bound simulation 2.b) ω Figure 2: Figure 2 shows the latency performance with oneinstantaneous zebroids via simulations along with the analytical approximation for a 10 × 10 torus with T = 10. The trends mentioned above are similar to that obtained from the analysis. However, somewhat counter-intuitively with relatively higher system storage, z-relay zebroids provide slightly lower improvements in latency as compared to one-instantaneous zebroids. We speculate that this is due to the different data item replica distributions enforced by them. Note that replacements performed by the zebroids cause fluctuations in these replica distributions which may effect future client requests. We are currently exploring suitable choices of parameters that can capture these changing replica distributions. 6.3 What is the overhead incurred with improvements in latency with zebroids? We find that the improvements in latency with zebroids are obtained at a minimal replacement overhead (< 1 per client request). 6.3.1 Analysis With one-instantaneous zebroids, for each client request a maximum of one zebroid is employed for latency improvement. Hence, the replacement overhead per client request can amount to a maximum of one.

Now a replacement is only incurred if one of these Nc i newly created replicas meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers. Let Xri and XNc i respectively be random variables that capture the minimum time till any of the ri and Nc i replicas meet the client. Since Xri and XNc i are assumed to be independent, by the property of exponentially distributed random variables we have, Overhead/request = 1 · P(XNc i < Xri ) + 0 · P(Xri ≤ XNc i ) (6) Overhead/request = ri C ri C + Nc i C = ri ri + Nc i (7) Recall that the number of replicas for data item i, ri, is a function of the total storage in the system i.e., ri = k·N ·α where k satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ ri ≤ N. Using this along with Equation 2, we get Overhead/request = 1 − G G + N · (1 − k · α) (8) Now if we keep the total system storage N · α constant since G and T are also constant, increasing N increases the replacement overhead. However, if N ·α is constant then increasing N causes α 80 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 Number of cars one−instantaneous zebroids Average number of replacements per request (N=20,α=10) (N=25,α=8) (N=50,α=4) (N=100,α=2) Figure 4: Figure 4 captures replacement overhead when employing one-instantaneous zebroids as a function of (N,α) values, when the total storage in the system is kept fixed, ST = 200. to go down. This implies that a higher replacement overhead is incurred for higher N and lower α values. Moreover, when ri = N, this means that every car has a replica of data item i. Hence, no zebroids are employed when this item is requested, yielding an overhead/request for this item as zero. Next, we present simulation results that validate our analysis hypothesis for the overhead associated with deployment of one-instantaneous zebroids. 6.3.2 Simulation Figure 4 shows the replacement overhead with one-instantaneous zebroids when (N,α) are varied while keeping the total system storage constant. The trends shown by the simulation are in agreement with those predicted by the analysis above. However, the total system storage can be changed either by varying car density (N) or storage per car (α). On account of similar trends, here we present the case when α is kept constant and N is varied (Figure 5). We refer the reader to [9] for the case when α is varied and N is held constant. We present an intuitive argument for the behavior of the perrequest replacement overhead curves. When the storage is extremely scarce so that only one replica per data item exists in the AutoMata network, the number of replacements performed by the zebroids is zero since any replacement will cause a data item to be lost from the system. The dispatcher ensures that no data item is lost from the system. At the other end of the spectrum, if storage becomes so abundant that α = T then the entire data item repository can be replicated on every car. The number of replacements is again zero since each request can be satisfied locally. A similar scenario occurs if N is increased to such a large value that another car with the requested data item is always available in the vicinity of the client. However, there is a storage spectrum in the middle where replacements by the scheduled zebroids result in improvements in δagg (see Figure 3). Moreover, we observe that for sparse storage scenarios, the higher improvements with z-relay zebroids are obtained at the cost of a higher replacement overhead when compared to the one-instantaneous zebroids case. This is because in the former case, each of these z zebroids selected along the lowest latency path to the client needs to perform a replacement. However, the replacement overhead is still less than 1 indicating that on an average less than one replacement per client request is needed even when z-relay zebroids are employed. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Number of cars z−relays one−instantaneous Average number of replacements per request Figure 5: Figure 5 shows the replacement overhead with zebroids for the cases when N is varied keeping α = 2. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 Prediction percentage no−zebroids (N=50) one−instantaneous (N=50) z−relays (N=50) no−zebroids (N=200) one−instantaneous (N=200) z−relays (N=200) Aggregate Availability Latency (δagg ) Figure 6: Figure 6 shows δagg for different car densities as a function of the prediction accuracy metric with α = 2 and T = 25. 6.4 What happens to the availability latency with zebroids in scenarios with inaccuracies in the car route predictions? We find that zebroids continue to provide improvements in availability latency even with lower accuracy in the car route predictions. We use a single parameter p to quantify the accuracy of the car route predictions. 6.4.1 Analysis Since p represents the probability that a car route predicted by the dispatcher matches the actual one, hence, the latency with zebroids can be approximated by, δerr agg = p · δagg(zeb) + (1 − p) · δagg(no − zeb) (9) δerr agg = p · δagg(zeb) + (1 − p) · C ri (10) Expressions for δagg(zeb) can be obtained from Equations 4 (one-instantaneous) or 5 (z-relay zebroids). 6.4.2 Simulation Figure 6 shows the variation in δagg as a function of this route prediction accuracy metric. We observe a smooth reduction in the 81 improvement in δagg as the prediction accuracy metric reduces. For zebroids that are scheduled but fail to rendezvous with the client due to the prediction error, we tag any such replacements made by the zebroids as failed. It is seen that failed replacements gradually increase as the prediction accuracy reduces. 6.5 Under what conditions are the improvements in availability latency with zebroids maximized? Surprisingly, we find that the improvements in latency obtained with one-instantaneous zebroids are independent of the input distribution of the popularity of the data items. 6.5.1 Analysis The fractional difference (labelled ω) in the latency between the no-zebroids and one-instantaneous zebroids is obtained from equations 2, 3, and 4 as ω = T i=1 fi·C ri − T i=1 fi·C ri+(N−ri)·(1−(1− 1 G )ri ) T i=1 fi·C ri (11) Here C = c·G·log G. This captures the fractional improvement in the availability latency obtained by employing one-instantaneous zebroids. Let α = 1, making the total storage in the system ST = N. Assuming the initial replica distribution is as per the squareroot replication scheme, we have, ri = √ fi·N T j=1 √ fj . Hence, we get fi = K2 ·r2 i N2 , where K = T j=1 fj. Using this, along with the approximation (1 − x)n 1 − n · x for small x, we simplify the above equation to get, ω = 1 − T i=1 ri 1+ N−ri G T i=1 ri In order to determine when the gains with one-instantaneous zebroids are maximized, we can frame an optimization problem as follows: Maximize ω, subject to T i=1 ri = ST THEOREM 1. With a square-root replication scheme, improvements obtained with one-instantaneous zebroids are independent of the input popularity distribution of the data items. (See [9] for proof) 6.5.2 Simulation We perform simulations with two different frequency distribution of data items: Uniform and Zipfian (with mean= 0.27). Similar latency improvements with one-instantaneous zebroids are obtained in both cases. This result has important implications. In cases with biased popularity toward certain data items, the aggregate improvements in latency across all data item requests still remain the same. Even in scenarios where the frequency of access to the data items changes dynamically, zebroids will continue to provide similar latency improvements. 7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS In this study, we examined the improvements in latency that can be obtained in the presence of carriers that deliver a data item from a server to a client. We quantified the variation in availability latency as a function of a rich set of parameters such as car density, storage per car, title database size, and replacement policies employed by zebroids. Below we summarize some key future research directions we intend to pursue. To better reflect reality we would like to validate the observations obtained from this study with some real world simulation traces of vehicular movements (for example using CORSIM [1]). This will also serve as a validation for the utility of the Markov mobility model used in this study. We are currently analyzing the performance of zebroids on a real world data set comprising of an ad-hoc network of buses moving around a small neighborhood in Amherst [4]. Zebroids may also be used for delivery of data items that carry delay sensitive information with a certain expiry. Extensions to zebroids that satisfy such application requirements presents an interesting future research direction. 8.

Nuestro entorno de destino utiliza operadores de datos, denominados Zebroids, donde un dispositivo móvil lleva un elemento de datos en nombre de un servidor a un cliente, minimizando así su latencia de disponibilidad. En este estudio, cuantificamos la variación en la latencia de disponibilidad con Zebroids en función de un rico conjunto de parámetros como la densidad del automóvil, el almacenamiento por dispositivo, el tamaño del repositorio y las políticas de reemplazo empleadas por Zebroids. Utilizando análisis y extensas simulaciones, obtenemos nuevas ideas sobre el diseño de sistemas basados en portadores. Se pueden obtener mejoras significativas en la latencia con cebroides a costa de una sobrecarga mínima. Estas mejoras ocurren incluso en escenarios con menor precisión en las predicciones de las rutas de automóviles. Dos hallazgos particularmente sorprendentes son: (1) una política ingenua de reemplazo aleatorio empleada por los Zebroids muestra un rendimiento competitivo, y (2) las mejoras de latencia obtenidas con una instanciación simplificada de Zebroides son robustas a los cambios en la distribución de popularidad de los elementos de datos.

Introducción Los avances tecnológicos en áreas de almacenamiento y comunicaciones inalámbricas ahora han hecho factible imaginar la entrega a pedido de elementos de datos, por ejemplo, clips de video y audio, en redes vehiculares de contenido de pares. En trabajo previo, Ghandeharizadeh et al.[10] introduzca el concepto de vehículos equipados con un dispositivo de autos-tope de automóviles, denominado autómata, para el entretenimiento en el vehículo. Las características notables de un autómata incluyen un dispositivo de almacenamiento masivo que ofrece cientos de gigabytes (GB) de almacenamiento, un procesador rápido y varios tipos de tarjetas de red. Incluso con las unidades de disco de 500 GB de hoy, un depósito de contenido de entretenimiento diverso puede exceder la capacidad de almacenamiento de un solo autómata. Tales repositorios constituyen el foco de este estudio. Para intercambiar datos, suponemos que cada autómata está configurado con dos tipos de tarjetas de red: 1) una tarjeta de red de bajo ancho de banda con una larga gama de radio en el orden de millas que permite que un dispositivo de autómata se comunique con una estación celular o WIMAX cercana, 2) Una tarjeta de red de alto ancho de banda con una rango de radio limitado en el orden de cientos de pies. La conexión de alto ancho de banda admite las tasas de datos en el orden de decenas a cientos de megabits por segundo y representa la red de pares ad-hoc entre los vehículos. Esto se etiqueta como el plano de datos y se emplea para intercambiar elementos de datos entre dispositivos. La conexión de bajo ancho de banda sirve como plano de control, lo que permite que los dispositivos de autómata intercambien metadatos con uno o más servidores centralizados. Esta conexión ofrece anchos de banda en el orden de decenas a cientos de kilobits por segundo. Los servidores centralizados, denominados despachadores, calculan los horarios de la entrega de datos a lo largo del plano de datos utilizando los metadatos proporcionados. Estos horarios se transmiten a los vehículos participantes utilizando el plano de control. La viabilidad técnica de dicha arquitectura de dos niveles se presenta en [7], con resultados preliminares para demostrar que el ancho de banda del plano de control es suficiente para el intercambio de información de control necesaria para realizar dicha aplicación. En un escenario típico, un dispositivo automático presenta a un pasajero con una lista de elementos de datos1, que muestra tanto el nombre de cada elemento de datos como su latencia de disponibilidad. Este último, denotado como δ, se define como el momento más temprano en el que el cliente encuentra una copia de su elemento de datos solicitado. Un elemento de datos está disponible inmediatamente cuando reside en el almacenamiento local del dispositivo automático que sirve a la solicitud. Debido a las limitaciones de almacenamiento, un autómata puede no almacenar todo el repositorio. En este caso, la latencia de disponibilidad es el momento desde que el usuario emite una solicitud hasta que los autómatas encuentran otro automóvil que contiene el elemento de datos referenciado.(Los términos automóviles y autómatas se usan indistintamente en este estudio). La latencia de disponibilidad para un elemento es una función de la ubicación actual del cliente, su destino y la ruta de viaje, el modelo de movilidad de los vehículos equipados con autómatas, el número de réplicas construidas para los diferentes elementos de datos y la ubicación de las réplicas del elemento de datos réplicasa través de los vehículos. Un método para mejorar la latencia de disponibilidad es emplear operadores de datos que transportan una réplica del elemento de datos solicitado desde un automóvil de servidor que lo contiene a un cliente que lo solicitó. Estos portadores de datos se denominan cebroides. La selección de Zebroids es facilitada por la arquitectura de dos niveles. El plano de control permite la recopilación de información centralizada en un despachador presente en una estación base.2 Algunos ejemplos de control en1 sin pérdida de generalidad, el elemento de datos del término podría ser medios tradicionales como texto o medios continuos, como un audio o video clip.2 Puede haber despachadores desplegados en un subconjunto de las estaciones base para la tolerancia a fallas y la robustez. Los despachadores entre basestaciones pueden comunicarse a través de la infraestructura con cable.75 Formación son actualmente solicitudes activas, ruta de viaje de los clientes y sus destinos, y caminos de los otros autos. Para cada solicitud del cliente, el despachador puede elegir un conjunto de operadores Z que colaboren para transferir un elemento de datos de un servidor a un cliente (Z-Relay Zebroids). Aquí, Z es el número de cebroides de tal manera que 0 ≤ z <n, donde n es el número total de automóviles. Cuando z = 0 no hay operadores, lo que requiere que un servidor entregue el elemento de datos directamente al cliente. De lo contrario, el equipo de relé elegido de Z Zebroids entrega el elemento de datos transitivamente entre sí para llegar al cliente, reduciendo así la latencia de disponibilidad (ver Sección 3.1 para más detalles). Para aumentar la robustez, el despachador puede emplear múltiples equipos de retransmisión de transportistas Z para cada solicitud. Esto puede ser útil en escenarios en los que el despachador tiene una precisión de predicción más baja en la información sobre las rutas de los automóviles. Finalmente, las limitaciones de almacenamiento pueden requerir que un Zebroid desaloje los elementos de datos existentes de su almacenamiento local para acomodar el elemento solicitado del cliente. En este estudio, cuantificamos los siguientes factores principales que afectan la latencia de disponibilidad en presencia de cebroides: (i) tamaño del repositorio del elemento de datos, (ii) densidad de automóvil, (iii) capacidad de almacenamiento por automóvil, (iv) duración del viaje del cliente, (((v) Esquema de reemplazo empleado por los Zebroides y (vi) precisión de las predicciones de ruta del automóvil. Para un subconjunto significativo de estos factores, abordamos algunas preguntas clave relacionadas con el uso de cebroides tanto mediante análisis como simulaciones extensas. Nuestros principales hallazgos son los siguientes. Una ingenua política de reemplazo aleatorio empleada por los Zebroids muestra un rendimiento competitivo en términos de latencia de disponibilidad. Con tal política, se pueden obtener mejoras sustanciales en la latencia con cebroides a una sobrecarga de reemplazo mínimo. En escenarios más prácticos, donde el despachador tiene información inexacta sobre las rutas de los automóviles, los Zebroids continúan proporcionando mejoras de latencia. Un resultado sorprendente es que los cambios en la popularidad de los elementos de datos no afectan las ganancias de latencia obtenidas con una simple instanciación de zebroides de relajación de Z llamados cebroides únicos (ver Sección 3.1). Este estudio sugiere una serie de instrucciones interesantes que se realizarán para obtener una mejor comprensión del diseño de sistemas basados en portadores que mejoran la latencia de disponibilidad. Trabajo relacionado: la replicación en las redes ad-hoc móviles ha sido un tema ampliamente estudiado [11, 12, 15]. Sin embargo, ninguno de estos estudios emplea cebroides como portadores de datos para reducir la latencia de las solicitudes de los clientes. Varios estudios novedosos e importantes como Zebranet [13], Daknet [14], Data Mules [16], Ferries de mensajes [20] y Seek y Focus [17] han analizado factores que afectan las redes conectadas intermitentemente que consisten en portadores de datos similares en espíritua cebroides. Los factores considerados por cada estudio están dictados por su entorno asumido y su aplicación objetivo. Una característica novedosa de nuestro estudio es el impacto en la latencia de disponibilidad para un repositorio de la base de datos determinado de elementos. Se puede obtener una descripción detallada de los trabajos relacionados en [9]. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La Sección 2 proporciona una visión general de la terminología junto con los factores que afectan la latencia de disponibilidad en presencia de cebroides. La Sección 3 describe cómo se pueden emplear los cebroides. La Sección 4 proporciona detalles de la metodología de análisis empleada para capturar el rendimiento con Zebroids. La Sección 5 describe los detalles del entorno de simulación utilizado para la evaluación. La Sección 6 solicita las preguntas clave examinadas en este estudio y las responde mediante análisis y simulaciones. Finalmente, la Sección 7 presenta breves conclusiones y futuras direcciones de investigación.2. Descripción general y terminología La Tabla 1 resume la notación de los parámetros utilizados en el documento. A continuación presentamos algo de terminología utilizada en el documento. Suponga una red de automóviles equipados con autos, cada uno con capacidad de almacenamiento de bytes α. La capacidad de almacenamiento total del sistema es ST = N · α. Hay t elementos de datos en la base de datos, cada uno con parámetros de la base de datos T número de elementos de datos. Tamaño de SI del elemento de datos I FI FIRENCE DE ACCESO AL INCIEDAD DE DATOS I.Parámetros de replicación RI Frecuencia normalizada de acceso al elemento de datos I RI Número de réplicas para el elemento de datos en el que caracteriza un esquema de replicación particular.Δi Disponibilidad promedio Latencia del ítem de datos I Δagg Latencia de disponibilidad agregada, Δagg = t j = 1 ΔJ · parámetros del sistema de autómata FJ número G Número de celdas en el mapa (2D-Torus). N Número de dispositivos automáticos en el sistema.Capacidad de almacenamiento α por autómata.γ Duración de viaje de los autómatas del cliente. ST Capacidad de almacenamiento total del sistema automático, ST = N · α. Tabla 1: Términos y sus definiciones Tamaño SI. La frecuencia de acceso al elemento de datos I se denota como FI, con T J = 1 FJ = 1. Deje que la duración del viaje de los autómatas del cliente se considere γ. Ahora definimos la frecuencia normalizada de acceso al ítem de datos I, denotado por RI, como: ri = (fi) n t j = 1 (fj) n;0 ≤ n ≤ ∞ (1) El exponente N caracteriza una técnica de replicación particular. Se realiza un esquema de replicación de raíz cuadrada cuando n = 0.5 [5]. Esto sirve como línea base para comparar con el caso cuando se implementan Zebroids. RI se normaliza a un valor entre 0 y 1. El número de réplicas para el ítem de datos I, denotado como RI, es: Ri = Min (N, Max (1, Ri · N · α SI)). Esto captura el caso cuando al menos una copia de cada elemento de datos debe estar presente en la red ad-hoc en todo momento. En los casos en que se puede perder un elemento de datos de la red ad-hoc, esta ecuación se convierte en ri = min (n, max (0, ri · n · α si)). En este caso, es posible que deba ser una solicitud para la solicitud de datos perdidas obteniendo el elemento de un servidor remoto. La latencia de disponibilidad para un elemento de datos I, denotado como ΔI, se define como el momento más temprano en el que un autómata de cliente encontrará la primera réplica del elemento accesible para él. Si esta condición no se satisface, entonces establecemos ΔI en γ. Esto indica que el elemento de datos no estaba disponible para el cliente durante su viaje. Tenga en cuenta que dado que hay al menos una réplica en el sistema para cada elemento de datos I, al establecer γ en un gran valor, nos aseguramos de que los clientes soliciten cualquier elemento de datos que esté satisfecho. Sin embargo, en la mayoría de las circunstancias prácticas, γ puede no ser tan grande como para encontrar cada elemento de datos. Estamos interesados en la latencia de disponibilidad observada en todos los elementos de datos. Por lo tanto, aumentamos la latencia de disponibilidad promedio para cada elemento de datos I con su FI para obtener la siguiente métrica de latencia de disponibilidad ponderada (Δagg): ΔAgG = t i = 1 Δi · Fi A continuación, presentamos nuestro enfoque de solución que describe cómo se seleccionan los cebroides.3. Enfoque de solución 3.1 Zebroids Cuando un cliente hace referencia a un elemento de datos que falta en su almacenamiento local, el despachador identifica todos los autos con una copia del elemento de datos como servidores. A continuación, el despachador obtiene las rutas futuras de todos los automóviles para una duración de tiempo finito equivalente al tiempo máximo que el cliente está dispuesto a esperar a que su solicitud sea atendida. Usando esta información, el despachador programa la ruta de entrega más rápida desde cualquiera de los servidores al cliente que usa cualquier otro automóvil como transportistas intermedios. Por lo tanto, determina el conjunto óptimo de las decisiones de reenvío 76 que permitirán que el elemento de datos se entregue al cliente en la cantidad mínima de tiempo. Tenga en cuenta que la latencia a lo largo de la ruta de entrega más rápida que emplea un equipo de retransmisión de Z Zebroids es similar a la obtenida con enrutamiento epidémico [19] bajo los supuestos de almacenamiento infinito y sin interferencia. Una simple instanciación de Zebroids de Relay Z ocurre cuando Z = 1 y la solicitud de los clientes desencadena una transferencia de una copia del elemento de datos solicitado de un servidor a un Zebroid en sus proximidades. Tal Zebroid se denomina Zebroid única. En algunos casos, el despachador podría tener información inexacta sobre las rutas de los automóviles. Por lo tanto, un Zebroid programado sobre la base de esta información inexacta puede no volver a enjuague con su cliente objetivo. Para minimizar la probabilidad de tales escenarios, el despachador puede programar múltiples cebroides. Esto puede incurrir en sobrecargas adicionales debido a la utilización redundante de los recursos para obtener las mismas mejoras de latencia. El tiempo requerido para transferir un elemento de datos de un servidor a un Zebroid depende de su tamaño y del ancho de banda de enlace disponible. Con pequeños elementos de datos, es razonable suponer que este tiempo de transferencia es pequeño, especialmente en presencia del plano de datos de alto ancho de banda. Los elementos de datos grandes pueden dividirse en fragmentos más pequeños que permiten al despachador programar uno o más cebroides para entregar cada fragmento a un cliente de manera oportuna. Esto sigue siendo una dirección de investigación futura. Inicialmente, el número de réplicas para cada elemento de datos se puede calcular las réplicas utilizando la Ecuación 1. Este esquema calcula el número de réplicas de elementos de datos en función de su popularidad. Es estático porque el número de réplicas en el sistema no cambia y no se realizan reemplazos. Por lo tanto, esto se conoce como el entorno de los nezebroides. Cuantificamos el rendimiento de las diversas políticas de reemplazo con referencia a esta línea base que no emplea cebroides. Uno puede asumir una fase de inicio en frío, donde inicialmente solo una o pocas copias de cada elemento de datos existen en el sistema. Muchas espacios de almacenamiento de los autos pueden estar desocupados. Cuando los automóviles se encuentran entre sí, construyen nuevas réplicas de algunos elementos de datos seleccionados para ocupar las ranuras vacías. El procedimiento de selección puede ser elegir los elementos de datos de manera uniforme al azar. Se crean nuevas réplicas siempre que un automóvil tenga un cierto umbral de su almacenamiento desocupado. Finalmente, la mayoría de la capacidad de almacenamiento de un automóvil se agotará.3.2 Políticas de reemplazo basadas en el operador Las políticas de reemplazo consideradas en este documento son reactivas ya que un reemplazo ocurre solo en respuesta a una solicitud emitida para un cierto elemento de datos. Cuando el almacenamiento local de un Zebroid está completamente ocupado, necesita reemplazar uno de sus elementos existentes para llevar el elemento de datos solicitado al cliente. Para este propósito, el Zebroid debe seleccionar un candidato apropiado para el desalojo. Este proceso de decisión es análogo al encontrado en la paginación del sistema operativo, donde el objetivo es maximizar la relación de accesorios de caché para evitar el retraso de acceso al disco [18]. Las políticas de reemplazo basadas en portadores empleadas en nuestro estudio se usan menos recientemente (LRU), menos frecuentemente usadas (LFU) y aleatorias (donde un candidato de desalojo se elige uniformemente al azar). Hemos considerado variantes locales y globales de las políticas LRU/LFU que determinan si el conocimiento local o global de los contenidos de los automóviles conocidos en el despachador se usa para la decisión de desalojo en un Zebroid (ver [9] para obtener más detalles). Las políticas de reemplazo incurren en los siguientes gastos generales. Primero, la complejidad asociada con la implementación de una política. En segundo lugar, el ancho de banda utilizado para transferir una copia de un elemento de datos de un servidor al Zebroid. Tercero, el número promedio de reemplazos incurridos por los Zebroids. Tenga en cuenta que en el caso de No-Zebroids no se incurre en sobrecarga. Las métricas consideradas en este estudio son la latencia de disponibilidad agregada, ΔAgG, la mejora porcentual en ΔAgG con cebroides en comparación con el caso de no bebroides y el número promedio de reemplazos incurridos por solicitud del cliente, que es un indicador de la sobrecarga incurrida por los cebroides. Tenga en cuenta que los despachadores con la ayuda del plano de control pueden garantizar que no se pierda ningún elemento de datos del sistema. En otras palabras, al menos una réplica de cada elemento de datos se mantiene en la red ad-hoc en todo momento. En tales casos, a pesar de que un automóvil puede cumplir con un cliente solicitante antes que otros servidores, si su almacenamiento local contiene elementos de datos con una sola copia en el sistema, entonces dicho automóvil no se elige como Zebroid.4. La metodología de análisis aquí, presentamos la metodología de evaluación analítica y algunas aproximaciones como ecuaciones de forma cerrada que capturan las mejoras en la latencia de disponibilidad que se pueden obtener con los cebroides de oneinstantáneos y Z-Relay. Primero, presentamos algunos preliminares de nuestra metodología de análisis.• Sea n el número de automóviles en la red realizando una caminata aleatoria 2D en un toro √ g × √ g. Un automóvil adicional sirve como cliente que produce un total de autos N + 1. Tal modelo de movilidad se ha utilizado ampliamente en la literatura [17, 16] principalmente porque es susceptible de análisis y proporciona una línea de base contra la cual se puede comparar el rendimiento de otros modelos de movilidad. Además, esta clase de modelos de movilidad de Markovian se ha utilizado para modelar los movimientos de los vehículos [3, 21].• Suponemos que todos los automóviles comienzan desde la distribución estacionaria y realizan caminatas aleatorias independientes. Aunque para escenarios de densidad dispersa, la suposición de independencia se mantiene, ya no es válida cuando n se acerca a G. • Deja que el tamaño del depósito de intereses del ítem de datos sea T. Además, el ítem de datos I tiene réplicas de RI. Esto implica que los automóviles RI, identificados como servidores, tienen una copia de este elemento de datos cuando el cliente solicita el elemento i. Todos los resultados de análisis presentados en esta sección se obtienen suponiendo que el cliente esté dispuesto a esperar siempre que sean satisfechos (duración del viaje ilimitada γ = ∞). Con el modelo de movilidad de caminata aleatoria en un Torus 2D, existe una garantía de que mientras haya al menos una réplica del elemento de datos solicitado en la red, el cliente eventualmente encontrará esta réplica [2]. Las extensiones al análisis que también consideran las duraciones de viaje finito se pueden obtener en [9]. Considere un escenario en el que no se empleen cebroides. En este caso, la latencia de disponibilidad esperada para el elemento de datos es el tiempo de reunión esperado de la caminata aleatoria realizada por el cliente con cualquiera de las caminatas aleatorias realizadas por los servidores. Aldous et al.[2] Muestre que el tiempo de reunión de dos caminatas aleatorias en tal entorno puede modelarse como una distribución exponencial con la media C = C · G · log G, donde la constante C 0.17 para G ≥ 25. El tiempo de reunión, o de manera equivalente, la latencia de disponibilidad ΔI, para el cliente que solicita el ítem de datos I es el momento hasta que encuentre cualquiera de estas réplicas de RI por primera vez. Esta también es una distribución exponencial con el siguiente valor esperado (tenga en cuenta que esta formulación es válida solo para casos dispersos cuando g >> ri): Δi = cglogg ri La latencia de disponibilidad agregada sin emplear cebroides es entonces esta expresión promediada sobre todos los elementos de datos,Ponderado por su frecuencia de acceso: Δagg (no-zeb) = t i = 1 fi · c · g · log g ri = t i = 1 fi · c ri (2) 77 4.1 Zebroides únicos recuerdan eso con una-Las cebroides instantáneas, para una solicitud dada, se crea una nueva réplica en un automóvil en las cercanías del servidor, siempre que este automóvil se reúna con el cliente antes que cualquiera de los servidores RI. Además, esta réplica se genera en el momento del momento cuando el cliente emite la solicitud. Deje que NC sea el número total esperado de nodos que están en la misma celda que cualquiera de los servidores RI. Luego, tenemos nc i = (n - ri) · (1 - (1 - 1 g) ri) (3) En el modelo analítico, suponemos que se crean nuevas réplicas nc i, de modo que el número total de réplicas esaumentado a RI +NC i. La latencia de disponibilidad se reduce ya que es más probable que el cliente cumpla con una réplica antes. La latencia de disponibilidad esperada agregada en el caso de cebroides individuales se da luego por Δagg (zeb) = t i = 1 fi · c · g · log g ri + nc i = t i = 1 fi · c ri + nc(4) Observe que al obtener esta expresión, para facilitar el análisis, hemos asumido que las nuevas réplicas comienzan desde ubicaciones aleatorias en el toro (no necesariamente de la misma celda que los servidores RI originales). Por lo tanto, trata todos los operadores NC I de forma independiente, al igual que los servidores originales de RI. Como mostraremos a continuación en comparación con las simulaciones, esta aproximación proporciona un límite superior en las mejoras que se pueden obtener porque da como resultado una latencia esperada más baja en el cliente. Cabe señalar que el procedimiento enumerado anteriormente producirá una latencia similar a la empleada por un despachador que emplea cebroides individuales (ver Sección 3.1). Dado que el despachador es consciente de todos los movimientos de automóviles futuros, solo transferiría el elemento de datos solicitado en un solo Zebroid, si determina que el Zebroid se reunirá con el cliente antes que cualquier otro servidor. Esta Zebroid seleccionada se incluye en las nuevas réplicas NC I.4.2 Zebroides de Relay Z Para calcular la latencia de disponibilidad esperada con Zebroides de Relay Z, utilizamos un problema de coloración analógico similar a un enfoque utilizado por Spyropoulos et al.[17]. Los detalles del procedimiento para obtener una expresión de forma cerrada se dan en [9]. La latencia de disponibilidad agregada (Δagg) con zebroides de rel-relay viene dada por Δagg (zeb) = t i = 1 [fi · c n + 1 · 1 n + 1-ri · (n · log n ri-log (n + +1 - ri))] (5) 5. Metodología de simulación El entorno de simulación considerado en este estudio comprende vehículos como los automóviles que llevan una fracción del repositorio de elementos de datos. Un parámetro de precisión de predicción proporciona inherentemente una cierta garantía probabilística sobre la confianza de las predicciones de la ruta del automóvil conocidas en el despachador. Un valor del 100% implica que las rutas exactas de todos los automóviles se conocen en todo momento. Un valor del 70% para este parámetro indica que las rutas predichas para los automóviles coincidirán con los reales con probabilidad 0.7. Tenga en cuenta que esta probabilidad se extiende a través de las rutas del automóvil durante toda la duración del viaje. Ahora proporcionamos los preliminares del estudio de simulación y luego describimos la configuración de parámetros utilizada en nuestros experimentos.• Similar a la metodología de análisis, el mapa utilizado es un toro 2D. Un modelo de movilidad de Markov que representa una caminata aleatoria 2D imparcial en la superficie del toro describe el movimiento de los autos a través de este toro.• Cada cuadrícula/celda es un estado único de esta cadena de Markov. En cada ranura de tiempo, cada automóvil realiza una transición de una celda a cualquiera de sus 8 celdas vecinas. La transición es una función de la ubicación actual del automóvil y una matriz de transición de probabilidad q = [QIJ] donde QIJ es la probabilidad de transición del estado I al estado j. Solo los autos equipados con autómatas dentro de la misma celda pueden comunicarse entre sí.• Los parámetros γ, δ se han discretizado y expresado en términos del número de ranuras de tiempo.• Un dispositivo automático no mantiene más de una réplica de un elemento de datos. Esto se debe a que las réplicas adicionales ocupan el almacenamiento sin proporcionar beneficios.• Se pueden emplear cebroids uno instantáneo o Z-Relay Z por solicitud del cliente para mejorar la latencia.• A menos que se mencione lo contrario, se supone que el parámetro de precisión de predicción es del 100%. Esto se debe a que este estudio tiene como objetivo cuantificar el efecto de una gran cantidad de parámetros individualmente en la latencia de disponibilidad. Aquí, establecemos el tamaño de cada elemento de datos, SI, para ser 1. α representa el número de ranuras de almacenamiento por autómata. Cada ranura de almacenamiento almacena un elemento de datos.γ representa la duración del viaje de los clientes en términos del número de espacios de tiempo. Por lo tanto, los posibles valores de latencia de disponibilidad son entre 0 y γ.δ se define como el número de ranuras de tiempo después de la cual un dispositivo de autómata cliente encontrará una réplica del elemento de datos por primera vez. Si el cliente encontró una réplica para el elemento de datos solicitado en la primera celda, entonces establecemos δ = 0. Si Δ> γ, entonces establecemos δ = γ, indicando que el cliente no encontró una copia del elemento de datos solicitado durante todo su viaje. En todas nuestras simulaciones, para la ilustración consideramos un Torus 2D 5 × 5 con γ establecido en 10. Nuestros experimentos indican que las tendencias en la escala de resultados a mapas de mayor tamaño. Simulamos una distribución sesgada de acceso a los elementos de datos T que obedecen la ley ZIPFS con una media de 0.27. Se muestra que esta distribución corresponde a la venta de entradas de cine en los Estados Unidos [6]. Empleamos un esquema de replicación que asigna réplicas para un elemento de datos en función de la raíz cuadrada de la frecuencia de acceso de ese elemento. Se muestra que el esquema de replicación de raíz cuadrada tiene un rendimiento de latencia competitiva en un gran espacio de parámetros [8]. Las réplicas del elemento de datos se distribuyen de manera uniforme a través de los dispositivos automáticos. Esto sirve como el caso de no vebroides de línea base. El esquema de raíz cuadrada también proporciona la distribución de réplica inicial cuando se emplean los cebroides. Tenga en cuenta que los reemplazos realizados por los Zebroids causarán cambios en la distribución de réplica del elemento de datos. Las solicitudes generadas según la distribución ZIPF se emiten una a la vez. El automóvil cliente que emite la solicitud se elige de manera redonda. Después de un período máximo de γ, se registra la latencia encontrada por esta solicitud. En todos los resultados de la simulación, cada punto es un promedio de 200,000 solicitudes. Además, los intervalos de confianza del 95% determinados para los resultados son bastante ajustados para las métricas de latencia y sobrecarga de reemplazo. Por lo tanto, solo los presentamos para la métrica que captura el porcentaje de mejora en la latencia con respecto al caso de no ceboides.6. Resultados En esta sección, describimos nuestros resultados de evaluación donde se abordan las siguientes preguntas clave. Con una amplia variedad de esquemas de reemplazo disponibles para un Zebroid, ¿cuál es su efecto sobre la latencia de disponibilidad? Una pregunta más central es: ¿los cebroides proporcionan 78 0 20 40 60 80 100 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 Número de automóviles Latencia de disponibilidad agregada (Δ AGG) LRU_GLOBAL LFU_GLOBAL LRU_LOCAL LFU_LOCAL AROYA Figura 1: La Figura 1 muestra la latencia de disponibilidad cuando se emplea un instantáneoZebroides en función de los valores (N, α), cuando el almacenamiento total en el sistema se mantiene fijo, ST = 200. ¿MEJORAS SIGNIFICADAS en la latencia de disponibilidad? ¿Cuál es la sobrecarga asociada incurrida para emplear estos cebroides? ¿Qué sucede con estas mejoras en escenarios en los que un despachador puede tener información imperfecta sobre las rutas de los automóviles? ¿Qué compensaciones inherentes existen entre la densidad del automóvil y el almacenamiento por automóvil con respecto a su efecto combinado e individual sobre la latencia de disponibilidad en presencia de cebroides? Presentamos tanto análisis simple como simulaciones detalladas para proporcionar respuestas a estas preguntas, así como obtener información sobre el diseño de sistemas basados en portadores.6.1 ¿Cómo es un esquema de reemplazo empleado por una latencia de disponibilidad de impacto cebroid? Para la ilustración, presentamos experimentos de escala donde se emplean los cebroides individuales (ver Figura 1). A escala, queremos decir que α y N se cambian proporcionalmente para mantener constante el almacenamiento total del sistema, ST,. Aquí, t = 50 y st = 200. Elegimos los siguientes valores de (n, α) = {(20,10), (25,8), (50,4), (100,2)}. La figura indica que un esquema de reemplazo aleatorio muestra un rendimiento competitivo. Esto se debe a varias razones. Recuerde que la distribución de réplica inicial se establece según el esquema de replicación Squareroot. El esquema de reemplazo aleatorio no altera esta distribución, ya que hace que los reemplazos sean ciegos a la popularidad de un elemento de datos. Sin embargo, los reemplazos causan una reorganización de datos dinámicos para atender mejor la solicitud actualmente activa. Además, el patrón de movilidad de los automóviles es aleatorio, por lo tanto, las ubicaciones de las cuales las solicitudes emiten los clientes también son aleatorios y no se conocen a priori en el despachador. Estos hallazgos son significativos porque se puede implementar una política de reemplazo aleatoria de manera descentralizada simple. Los esquemas LRU-global y LFU-global proporcionan un rendimiento de latencia que es peor que al azar. Esto se debe a que estas políticas desarrollan rápidamente una preferencia por los elementos de datos más populares, creando así una mayor cantidad de réplicas para ellos. Durante el desalojo, los elementos de datos más populares casi nunca se seleccionan como candidato de reemplazo. En consecuencia, hay menos réplicas para los artículos menos populares. Por lo tanto, la distribución inicial de las réplicas del elemento de datos cambia de raíz cuadrada a esa parecido a la replicación lineal. El mayor número de réplicas para los elementos de datos populares proporciona beneficios adicionales marginales, mientras que el menor número de réplicas para los otros elementos de datos perjudica el rendimiento de latencia de estas políticas globales. Los esquemas LFU-Local y LRU-Local tienen un rendimiento similar al aleatorio ya que no tienen suficiente historial de solicitudes de elementos de datos locales. Especulamos que el desempeño de estas políticas locales abordará el de sus variantes globales para un historial lo suficientemente grande de solicitudes de elementos de datos. Debido al rendimiento competitivo mostrado por una política aleatoria, por el resto del documento, presentamos el rendimiento de los cebroides que emplean una política de reemplazo aleatorio.6.2 ¿Los zebroides proporcionan mejoras significativas en la latencia de disponibilidad? Encontramos que en muchos escenarios emplear cebroides proporciona mejoras sustanciales en la latencia de disponibilidad.6.2.1 Análisis primero consideramos el caso de cebroides individuales. La Figura 2.a muestra la variación en Δagg en función de N para t = 10 y α = 1 con un toro de 10 × 10 usando la ecuación 4. Los ejes X e Y se dibujan a una escala logarítmica. Figura 2.b Muestra el % de mejora en ΔAgG obtenida con cebroides individuales. En este caso, solo el eje X se siente a una escala logarítmica. Para ilustración, suponemos que los elementos de datos T se solicitan de manera uniforme. Inicialmente, cuando la red es escasa, la aproximación analítica para las mejoras en la latencia con cebroides, obtenida de las ecuaciones 2 y 4, coincide estrechamente con los resultados de la simulación. Sin embargo, a medida que aumenta N, la suposición de escasez para la cual el análisis es válido, a saber, n << g, ya no es cierto. Por lo tanto, las dos curvas divergen rápidamente. El punto en el que las dos curvas se alejan entre sí corresponden a un valor de Δagg ≤ 1. Además, como se mencionó anteriormente, el análisis proporciona un límite superior en las mejoras de latencia, ya que trata las réplicas recién creadas dadas por NC I de forma independiente. Sin embargo, estas réplicas de NC I comienzan desde la misma celda que una de las riegas RI del servidor. Finalmente, el análisis captura un escenario de OneShot donde dada una distribución de réplica de elemento de datos inicial, se calcula la latencia de disponibilidad. Las nuevas réplicas creadas no afectan las solicitudes futuras del cliente. Debido a las limitaciones del espacio, aquí resumimos las observaciones en el caso en que se emplean Z-Relay Zebroids. El lector interesado puede obtener más detalles en [9]. Observaciones similares, como el caso Zebroid único, se aplican ya que las curvas de simulación y análisis nuevamente comienzan a divergir cuando los supuestos de análisis ya no son válidos. Sin embargo, la observación clave aquí es que la mejora de la latencia con los cebroides de Relay Z es significativamente mejor que el caso de Zebroids individual, especialmente para escenarios de almacenamiento más bajos. Esto se debe a que en escenarios dispersos, las transferencias transitivas entre los cebroides crean un mayor número de réplicas para el elemento de datos solicitado, lo que produce una menor latencia de disponibilidad. Además, también se ve que la curva de validación de simulación para las mejoras en ΔAgg con Zebroids de rel-relay se acerca a la de la caja cebroide única para un almacenamiento más alto (valores de N más altos). Esto se debe a que los cebroides únicos son un caso especial de Zebroides de Z-Relay.6.2.2 Simulación Realizamos simulaciones para examinar todo el espectro de almacenamiento obtenido cambiando la densidad del automóvil N o el almacenamiento por automóvil α para capturar también escenarios donde los supuestos de escasez para los cuales el análisis es válido no se mantiene. Separamos el efecto de N y α capturando la variación de N mientras mantiene α constante (Caso 1) y viceversa (caso 2) con Z-Relay y Zebroides individuales. Aquí, establecemos el tamaño del repositorio como t = 25. La Figura 3 captura el caso 1 mencionado anteriormente. Se observan tendencias similares con el caso 2, una descripción completa de esos resultados está disponible en [9]. Con la Figura 3.B, manteniendo constante α, inicialmente aumentar la densidad del automóvil tiene mayores beneficios de latencia porque el aumento de N introduce más cebroides en el sistema. A medida que aumenta aún más, Ω se reduce porque el almacenamiento total en el sistema aumenta. En consecuencia, el número de réplicas por elemento de datos aumenta así, aumentando el número 79 de servidores. Por lo tanto, la política de reemplazo no puede encontrar un Zebroid con tanta frecuencia para transportar el elemento de datos solicitado al cliente antes que cualquiera de los servidores. Por otro lado, el mayor número de servidores beneficia el caso de no n de nicebroides para derribar Δagg. El efecto neto da como resultado una reducción en Ω para valores más grandes de N. 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 Número de automóvilΔagg) 2.a) Δagg 10 1 10 2 10 3 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 80 90 100 100 Número de automóviles % de mejora en Δagg WRT No - Zebroides (Ω) Simulación analítica de nivel superior 2.b) Ω Figura 2: La Figura 2 muestra el rendimiento de latencia con Zebroides oneinstantáneos a través de simulaciones junto con la aproximación analítica para un toro de 10 × 10 con t = 10. Las tendencias mencionadas anteriormente son similares a las obtenidas del análisis. Sin embargo, algo contradictorio con el almacenamiento relativamente más alto del sistema, los cebroides de relajación Z proporcionan mejoras ligeramente más bajas en la latencia en comparación con los cebroides individuales. Especulamos que esto se debe a las diferentes distribuciones de réplicas de elementos de datos impuestos por ellos. Tenga en cuenta que los reemplazos realizados por los Zebroids causan fluctuaciones en estas distribuciones de réplicas que pueden afectar las futuras solicitudes del cliente. Actualmente estamos explorando opciones adecuadas de parámetros que pueden capturar estas distribuciones de réplicas cambiantes.6.3 ¿Cuál es la sobrecarga incurrida con mejoras en la latencia con Zebroids? Encontramos que las mejoras en la latencia con Zebroids se obtienen a una sobrecarga mínima de reemplazo (<1 por solicitud del cliente).6.3.1 Análisis con cebroides individuales, para cada cliente solicita un máximo de un Zebroid para mejorar la latencia. Por lo tanto, la sobrecarga de reemplazo por solicitud del cliente puede equivaler a un máximo de uno. Recuerde que para calcular la latencia con una instantánea 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Número de automóvil150 200 250 300 350 400 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Número de automóviles % de mejora en Δagg WRT No-Bebroides (Ω) Locas z itantáneas 3.B Figura 3: La Figura 3 representa el rendimiento de latencia con ambos instantáneosy Z-Relay Zebroids en función de la densidad del automóvil cuando α = 2 y t = 25. Zebroides, NC I nuevas réplicas se crean en la misma celda que los servidores. Ahora solo se incurre en un reemplazo si una de estas réplicas recientemente creadas de NC I se encuentra con el cliente antes que cualquiera de los servidores RI. Sea XRI y XNC, respectivamente, serán variables aleatorias que capturan el tiempo mínimo hasta cualquiera de las réplicas RI y NC I se encuentran con el cliente. Dado que se supone que XRI y XNC I son independientes, por la propiedad de variables aleatorias distribuidas exponencialmente, tenemos, sobrecarga/request = 1 · p (xnc i <xri) + 0 · p (xri ≤ xnc i) (6) sobrecarga/Solicitud = Ri c ri c + nc i c = ri ri + nc i (7) Recuerde que el número de réplicas para el elemento de datos I, RI, es una función del almacenamiento total en el sistema, es decir, RI = K · n ·α donde k satisface la restricción 1 ≤ ri ≤ N. Usando esto junto con la ecuación 2, obtenemos sobrecarga/solicitud = 1 - g g + n · (1 - k · α) (8) Ahora si mantenemos el almacenamiento total del sistema N· Α constante ya que G y T también son constantes, el aumento de N aumenta la sobrecarga de reemplazo. Sin embargo, si N · α es constante, el aumento de N causa α 80 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 Número de automóvil= 10) (n = 25, α = 8) (n = 50, α = 4) (n = 100, α = 2) Figura 4: La Figura 4 captura la sobrecarga de reemplazo cuando se emplea cebroides instantáneos en función de (n (n, α) valores, cuando el almacenamiento total en el sistema se mantiene fijo, st = 200. Baje. Esto implica que se incurre en una sobrecarga de reemplazo más alta para valores de N más altos y más bajos. Además, cuando ri = n, esto significa que cada automóvil tiene una réplica del elemento de datos i. Por lo tanto, no se emplean cebroides cuando se solicita este artículo, lo que produce una sobrecarga/solicitud de este artículo como cero. A continuación, presentamos resultados de simulación que validan nuestra hipótesis de análisis para la sobrecarga asociada con el despliegue de cebroides individuales.6.3.2 Simulación La Figura 4 muestra la sobrecarga de reemplazo con cebroides individuales cuando (n, α) varían mientras mantiene constante el almacenamiento total del sistema. Las tendencias mostradas por la simulación están de acuerdo con las predichas por el análisis anterior. Sin embargo, el almacenamiento total del sistema se puede cambiar ya sea variando la densidad del automóvil (N) o el almacenamiento por automóvil (α). Debido a tendencias similares, aquí presentamos el caso cuando α se mantiene constante y N varía (Figura 5). Remitimos al lector a [9] para el caso cuando α varía y N se mantiene constante. Presentamos un argumento intuitivo para el comportamiento de las curvas de reemplazo de reemplazo de Perrequest. Cuando el almacenamiento es extremadamente escaso, por lo que solo existe una réplica por elemento de datos en la red de autómatas, el número de reemplazos realizados por los Zebroids es cero ya que cualquier reemplazo hará que se pierda un elemento de datos del sistema. El despachador asegura que no se pierda ningún elemento de datos del sistema. En el otro extremo del espectro, si el almacenamiento se vuelve tan abundante que α = t, entonces todo el repositorio del elemento de datos puede replicarse en cada automóvil. El número de reemplazos es nuevamente cero ya que cada solicitud se puede cumplir localmente. Un escenario similar ocurre si N se incrementa a un valor tan grande que otro automóvil con el elemento de datos solicitado siempre está disponible en las cercanías del cliente. Sin embargo, hay un espectro de almacenamiento en el medio donde los reemplazos de los cebroides programados dan como resultado mejoras en ΔAgg (ver Figura 3). Además, observamos que para los escenarios de almacenamiento disperso, las mejoras más altas con Zebroides de Relay Z se obtienen a costa de una sobrecarga de reemplazo más alta en comparación con el caso de Zebroids individual. Esto se debe a que en el primer caso, cada una de estas zebroides Z seleccionadas a lo largo de la ruta de latencia más baja al cliente debe realizar un reemplazo. Sin embargo, la sobrecarga de reemplazo aún es inferior a 1, lo que indica que en un promedio de menos de un reemplazo por solicitud del cliente se necesita incluso cuando se emplean Zebroides de Relay Z.0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Número de automóvilN se varía manteniendo α = 2. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 Porcentaje de predicción No - Zebroides (n = 50) One - Instantáneo (n = 50) Z -Releys (N= 50) No -Zebroids (n = 200) Uno -instantáneo (n = 200) Z -Reloys (n = 200) Latencia de disponibilidad agregada (Δagg) Figura 6: La Figura 6 muestra ΔAgG para diferentes densidades de automóviles en función de la predicción de la predicciónMétrica de precisión con α = 2 y t = 25. 6.4 ¿Qué sucede con la latencia de disponibilidad con cebroides en escenarios con inexactitudes en las predicciones de la ruta del automóvil? Encontramos que los cebroides continúan proporcionando mejoras en la latencia de disponibilidad incluso con una menor precisión en las predicciones de la ruta del automóvil. Utilizamos un solo parámetro P para cuantificar la precisión de las predicciones de la ruta del automóvil.6.4.1 Análisis Dado que P representa la probabilidad de que una ruta de automóvil predicha por el despachador coincida con la real, por lo tanto, la latencia con Zebroides puede ser aproximada por ΔERR Agg = P · Δagg (Zeb) + (1 - P) · Δagg(no-zeb) (9) Δerr agg = p · Δagg (zeb) + (1-p) · c ri (10) Las expresiones para ΔAgg (zeb) se pueden obtener de las ecuaciones 4 (unas instantáneas) o 5 (z (z-Relay Zebroids).6.4.2 Simulación La Figura 6 muestra la variación en Δagg en función de esta métrica de precisión de predicción de la ruta. Observamos una reducción suave en la mejora 81 en ΔAgG a medida que se reduce la métrica de precisión de predicción. Para los cebroides que están programados pero no se enredan con el cliente debido al error de predicción, etiquetamos dichos reemplazos realizados por los Zebroids como falló. Se ve que los reemplazos fallidos aumentan gradualmente a medida que se reduce la precisión de la predicción.6.5 ¿En qué condiciones se maximizan las mejoras en la latencia de disponibilidad con Zebroids? Sorprendentemente, encontramos que las mejoras en la latencia obtenidas con cebroides individuales son independientes de la distribución de entrada de la popularidad de los elementos de datos.6.5.1 Análisis La diferencia fraccional (etiquetada ω) en la latencia entre los no-bebroides y los cebroides individuales se obtiene de las ecuaciones 2, 3 y 4 como Ω = t i = 1 fi · c ri-t i = 1fi · c ri+(n - ri) · (1− (1− 1 g) ri) t i = 1 fi · c ri (11) aquí c = c · g · log G. Esto captura la mejora fraccional en la disponibilidadLatencia obtenida al emplear cebroides individuales. Sea α = 1, haciendo que el almacenamiento total en el sistema st = N. suponiendo que la distribución de réplica inicial sea según el esquema de replicación Squareroot, tenemos, ri = √ fi · n t j = 1 √ fj. Por lo tanto, obtenemos fi = k2 · r2 i n2, donde k = t j = 1 fj. Usando esto, junto con la aproximación (1 - x) n 1 - n · x para x x, simplificamos la ecuación anterior para obtener, ω = 1 - t i = 1 ri 1+ n - ri g t i = 1 ri in in in in in in in in in in inPara determinar cuándo se maximizan las ganancias con Zebroides únicos, podemos enmarcar un problema de optimización de la siguiente manera: Maximizar ω, sujeto a t i = 1 RI = ST TEOREM 1. Con un esquema de replicación de raíz cuadrada, las mejoras obtenidas con cebroides individuales son independientes de la distribución de popularidad de entrada de los elementos de datos.(Consulte [9] para la prueba) 6.5.2 Simulación realizamos simulaciones con dos distribución de frecuencia diferente de elementos de datos: uniforme y Zipfian (con media = 0.27). Mejoras de latencia similares con cebroides individuales se obtienen en ambos casos. Este resultado tiene implicaciones importantes. En casos con popularidad sesgada hacia ciertos elementos de datos, las mejoras agregadas en la latencia en todas las solicitudes de elementos de datos siguen siendo las mismas. Incluso en escenarios en los que la frecuencia de acceso a los elementos de datos cambia dinámicamente, los Zebroids continuarán proporcionando mejoras de latencia similares.7. Conclusiones y futuras direcciones de investigación En este estudio, examinamos las mejoras en la latencia que se pueden obtener en presencia de portadores que entregan un elemento de datos de un servidor a un cliente. Cuantificamos la variación en la latencia de disponibilidad en función de un rico conjunto de parámetros, como la densidad del automóvil, el almacenamiento por automóvil, el tamaño de la base de datos de título y las políticas de reemplazo empleadas por Zebroids. A continuación resumimos algunas direcciones clave de investigación futuras que pretendemos seguir. Para reflejar mejor la realidad, nos gustaría validar las observaciones obtenidas de este estudio con algunos rastros de simulación del mundo real de los movimientos vehiculares (por ejemplo, usando Corsim [1]). Esto también servirá como validación para la utilidad del modelo de movilidad de Markov utilizado en este estudio. Actualmente estamos analizando el rendimiento de Zebroids en un conjunto de datos del mundo real que comprende una red ad-hoc de autobuses que se mueven alrededor de un pequeño vecindario en Amherst [4]. Los Zebroids también se pueden utilizar para la entrega de elementos de datos que llevan información confidencial de retraso con un cierto vencimiento. Extensiones a Zebroids que satisfacen tales requisitos de aplicación presenta una interesante dirección de investigación futura.8.

        "An Evaluation of Availability Latency in Carrier-based Vehicular ad-hoc Networks Shahram Ghandeharizadeh Dept of Computer Science Univ of Southern California Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA shahram@usc.edu Shyam Kapadia Dept of Computer Science Univ of Southern California Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA kapadia@usc.edu Bhaskar Krishnamachari Dept of Computer Science Dept of Electrical Engineering Univ of Southern California Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA bkrishna@usc.edu ABSTRACT On-demand delivery of audio and video clips in peer-to-peer vehicular ad-hoc networks is an emerging area of research.",
        "Our target environment uses data carriers, termed zebroids, where a mobile device carries a data item on behalf of a server to a client thereby minimizing its availability latency.",
        "In this study, we quantify the variation in availability latency with zebroids as a function of a rich set of parameters such as car density, storage per device, repository size, and replacement policies employed by zebroids.",
        "Using analysis and extensive simulations, we gain novel insights into the design of carrier-based systems.",
        "Significant improvements in latency can be obtained with zebroids at the cost of a minimal overhead.",
        "These improvements occur even in scenarios with lower accuracy in the predictions of the car routes.",
        "Two particularly surprising findings are: (1) a naive random replacement policy employed by the zebroids shows competitive performance, and (2) latency improvements obtained with a simplified instantiation of zebroids are found to be robust to changes in the popularity distribution of the data items.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors: C.2.4 [Distributed Systems]: Client/Server General Terms: Algorithms, Performance, Design, Experimentation. 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Technological advances in areas of storage and wireless communications have now made it feasible to envision on-demand delivery of data items, for e.g., video and audio clips, in vehicular peer-topeer networks.",
        "In prior work, Ghandeharizadeh et al. [10] introduce the concept of vehicles equipped with a Car-to-Car-Peer-toPeer device, termed AutoMata, for in-vehicle entertainment.",
        "The notable features of an AutoMata include a mass storage device offering hundreds of gigabytes (GB) of storage, a fast processor, and several types of networking cards.",
        "Even with todays 500 GB disk drives, a repository of diverse entertainment content may exceed the storage capacity of a single AutoMata.",
        "Such repositories constitute the focus of this study.",
        "To exchange data, we assume each AutoMata is configured with two types of networking cards: 1) a low-bandwidth networking card with a long radio-range in the order of miles that enables an AutoMata device to communicate with a nearby cellular or WiMax station, 2) a high-bandwidth networking card with a limited radio-range in the order of hundreds of feet.",
        "The high bandwidth connection supports data rates in the order of tens to hundreds of Megabits per second and represents the ad-hoc peer to peer network between the vehicles.",
        "This is labelled as the data plane and is employed to exchange data items between devices.",
        "The low-bandwidth connection serves as the control plane, enabling AutoMata devices to exchange meta-data with one or more centralized servers.",
        "This connection offers bandwidths in the order of tens to hundreds of Kilobits per second.",
        "The centralized servers, termed dispatchers, compute schedules of data delivery along the data plane using the provided meta-data.",
        "These schedules are transmitted to the participating vehicles using the control plane.",
        "The technical feasibility of such a two-tier architecture is presented in [7], with preliminary results to demonstrate the bandwidth of the control plane is sufficient for exchange of control information needed for realizing such an application.",
        "In a typical scenario, an AutoMata device presents a passenger with a list of data items1 , showing both the name of each data item and its availability latency.",
        "The latter, denoted as δ, is defined as the earliest time at which the client encounters a copy of its requested data item.",
        "A data item is available immediately when it resides in the local storage of the AutoMata device serving the request.",
        "Due to storage constraints, an AutoMata may not store the entire repository.",
        "In this case, availability latency is the time from when the user issues a request until when the AutoMata encounters another car containing the referenced data item. (The terms car and AutoMata are used interchangeably in this study.)",
        "The availability latency for an item is a function of the current location of the client, its destination and travel path, the mobility model of the AutoMata equipped vehicles, the number of replicas constructed for the different data items, and the placement of data item replicas across the vehicles.",
        "A method to improve the availability latency is to employ data carriers which transport a replica of the requested data item from a server car containing it to a client that requested it.",
        "These data carriers are termed zebroids.",
        "Selection of zebroids is facilitated by the two-tiered architecture.",
        "The control plane enables centralized information gathering at a dispatcher present at a base-station.2 Some examples of control in1 Without loss of generality, the term data item might be either traditional media such as text or continuous media such as an audio or video clip. 2 There may be dispatchers deployed at a subset of the base-stations for fault-tolerance and robustness.",
        "Dispatchers between basestations may communicate via the wired infrastructure. 75 formation are currently active requests, travel path of the clients and their destinations, and paths of the other cars.",
        "For each client request, the dispatcher may choose a set of z carriers that collaborate to transfer a data item from a server to a client (z-relay zebroids).",
        "Here, z is the number of zebroids such that 0 ≤ z < N, where N is the total number of cars.",
        "When z = 0 there are no carriers, requiring a server to deliver the data item directly to the client.",
        "Otherwise, the chosen relay team of z zebroids hand over the data item transitively to one another to arrive at the client, thereby reducing availability latency (see Section 3.1 for details).",
        "To increase robustness, the dispatcher may employ multiple relay teams of z-carriers for every request.",
        "This may be useful in scenarios where the dispatcher has lower prediction accuracy in the information about the routes of the cars.",
        "Finally, storage constraints may require a zebroid to evict existing data items from its local storage to accommodate the client requested item.",
        "In this study, we quantify the following main factors that affect availability latency in the presence of zebroids: (i) data item repository size, (ii) car density, (iii) storage capacity per car, (iv) client trip duration, (v) replacement scheme employed by the zebroids, and (vi) accuracy of the car route predictions.",
        "For a significant subset of these factors, we address some key questions pertaining to use of zebroids both via analysis and extensive simulations.",
        "Our main findings are as follows.",
        "A naive random replacement policy employed by the zebroids shows competitive performance in terms of availability latency.",
        "With such a policy, substantial improvements in latency can be obtained with zebroids at a minimal replacement overhead.",
        "In more practical scenarios, where the dispatcher has inaccurate information about the car routes, zebroids continue to provide latency improvements.",
        "A surprising result is that changes in popularity of the data items do not impact the latency gains obtained with a simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids called one-instantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
        "This study suggests a number of interesting directions to be pursued to gain better understanding of design of carrier-based systems that improve availability latency.",
        "Related Work: Replication in mobile ad-hoc networks has been a widely studied topic [11, 12, 15].",
        "However, none of these studies employ zebroids as data carriers to reduce the latency of the clients requests.",
        "Several novel and important studies such as ZebraNet [13], DakNet [14], Data Mules [16], Message Ferries [20], and Seek and Focus [17] have analyzed factors impacting intermittently connected networks consisting of data carriers similar in spirit to zebroids.",
        "Factors considered by each study are dictated by their assumed environment and target application.",
        "A novel characteristic of our study is the impact on availability latency for a given database repository of items.",
        "A detailed description of related works can be obtained in [9].",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides an overview of the terminology along with the factors that impact availability latency in the presence of zebroids.",
        "Section 3 describes how the zebroids may be employed.",
        "Section 4 provides details of the analysis methodology employed to capture the performance with zebroids.",
        "Section 5 describes the details of the simulation environment used for evaluation.",
        "Section 6 enlists the key questions examined in this study and answers them via analysis and simulations.",
        "Finally, Section 7 presents brief conclusions and future research directions. 2.",
        "OVERVIEW AND TERMINOLOGY Table 1 summarizes the notation of the parameters used in the paper.",
        "Below we introduce some terminology used in the paper.",
        "Assume a network of N AutoMata-equipped cars, each with storage capacity of α bytes.",
        "The total storage capacity of the system is ST =N ·α.",
        "There are T data items in the database, each with Database Parameters T Number of data items.",
        "Si Size of data item i fi Frequency of access to data item i. Replication Parameters Ri Normalized frequency of access to data item i ri Number of replicas for data item i n Characterizes a particular replication scheme. δi Average availability latency of data item i δagg Aggregate availability latency, δagg = T j=1 δj · fj AutoMata System Parameters G Number of cells in the map (2D-torus).",
        "N Number of AutoMata devices in the system. α Storage capacity per AutoMata. γ Trip duration of the client AutoMata.",
        "ST Total storage capacity of the AutoMata system, ST = N · α.",
        "Table 1: Terms and their definitions size Si.",
        "The frequency of access to data item i is denoted as fi, with T j=1 fj = 1.",
        "Let the trip duration of the client AutoMata under consideration be γ.",
        "We now define the normalized frequency of access to the data item i, denoted by Ri, as: Ri = (fi)n T j=1(fj)n ; 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞ (1) The exponent n characterizes a particular replication technique.",
        "A square-root replication scheme is realized when n = 0.5 [5].",
        "This serves as the base-line for comparison with the case when zebroids are deployed.",
        "Ri is normalized to a value between 0 and 1.",
        "The number of replicas for data item i, denoted as ri, is: ri = min (N, max (1, Ri·N·α Si )).",
        "This captures the case when at least one copy of every data item must be present in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
        "In cases where a data item may be lost from the ad-hoc network, this equation becomes ri = min (N, max (0, Ri·N·α Si )).",
        "In this case, a request for the lost data item may need to be satisfied by fetching the item from a remote server.",
        "The availability latency for a data item i, denoted as δi, is defined as the earliest time at which a client AutoMata will find the first replica of the item accessible to it.",
        "If this condition is not satisfied, then we set δi to γ.",
        "This indicates that data item i was not available to the client during its journey.",
        "Note that since there is at least one replica in the system for every data item i, by setting γ to a large value we ensure that the clients request for any data item i will be satisfied.",
        "However, in most practical circumstances γ may not be so large as to find every data item.",
        "We are interested in the availability latency observed across all data items.",
        "Hence, we augment the average availability latency for every data item i with its fi to obtain the following weighted availability latency (δagg) metric: δagg = T i=1 δi · fi Next, we present our solution approach describing how zebroids are selected. 3.",
        "SOLUTION APPROACH 3.1 Zebroids When a client references a data item missing from its local storage, the dispatcher identifies all cars with a copy of the data item as servers.",
        "Next, the dispatcher obtains the future routes of all cars for a finite time duration equivalent to the maximum time the client is willing to wait for its request to be serviced.",
        "Using this information, the dispatcher schedules the quickest delivery path from any of the servers to the client using any other cars as intermediate carriers.",
        "Hence, it determines the optimal set of forwarding decisions 76 that will enable the data item to be delivered to the client in the minimum amount of time.",
        "Note that the latency along the quickest delivery path that employs a relay team of z zebroids is similar to that obtained with epidemic routing [19] under the assumptions of infinite storage and no interference.",
        "A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the clients request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity.",
        "Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid.",
        "In some cases, the dispatcher might have inaccurate information about the routes of the cars.",
        "Hence, a zebroid scheduled on the basis of this inaccurate information may not rendezvous with its target client.",
        "To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids.",
        "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
        "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",
        "With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane.",
        "Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner.",
        "This remains a future research direction.",
        "Initially, number of replicas for each data item replicas might be computed using Equation 1.",
        "This scheme computes the number of data item replicas as a function of their popularity.",
        "It is static because number of replicas in the system do not change and no replacements are performed.",
        "Hence, this is referred to as the nozebroids environment.",
        "We quantify the performance of the various replacement policies with reference to this base-line that does not employ zebroids.",
        "One may assume a cold start phase, where initially only one or few copies of every data item exist in the system.",
        "Many storage slots of the cars may be unoccupied.",
        "When the cars encounter one another they construct new replicas of some selected data items to occupy the empty slots.",
        "The selection procedure may be to choose the data items uniformly at random.",
        "New replicas are created as long as a car has a certain threshold of its storage unoccupied.",
        "Eventually, majority of the storage capacity of a car will be exhausted. 3.2 Carrier-based Replacement policies The replacement policies considered in this paper are reactive since a replacement occurs only in response to a request issued for a certain data item.",
        "When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item.",
        "For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.",
        "This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18].",
        "The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random).",
        "We have considered local and global variants of the LRU/LFU policies which determine whether local or global knowledge of contents of the cars known at the dispatcher is used for the eviction decision at a zebroid (see [9] for more details).",
        "The replacement policies incur the following overheads.",
        "First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy.",
        "Second, the bandwidth used to transfer a copy of a data item from a server to the zebroid.",
        "Third, the average number of replacements incurred by the zebroids.",
        "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
        "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
        "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
        "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
        "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",
        "ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids.",
        "First, we present some preliminaries of our analysis methodology. • Let N be the number of cars in the network performing a 2D random walk on a √ G× √ G torus.",
        "An additional car serves as a client yielding a total of N + 1 cars.",
        "Such a mobility model has been used widely in the literature [17, 16] chiefly because it is amenable to analysis and provides a baseline against which performance of other mobility models can be compared.",
        "Moreover, this class of Markovian mobility models has been used to model the movements of vehicles [3, 21]. • We assume that all cars start from the stationary distribution and perform independent random walks.",
        "Although for sparse density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it is no longer valid when N approaches G. • Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also, data item i has ri replicas.",
        "This implies ri cars, identified as servers, have a copy of this data item when the client requests item i.",
        "All analysis results presented in this section are obtained assuming that the client is willing to wait as long as it takes for its request to be satisfied (unbounded trip duration γ = ∞).",
        "With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2].",
        "Extensions to the analysis that also consider finite trip durations can be obtained in [9].",
        "Consider a scenario where no zebroids are employed.",
        "In this case, the expected availability latency for the data item is the expected meeting time of the random walk undertaken by the client with any of the random walks performed by the servers.",
        "Aldous et al. [2] show that the the meeting time of two random walks in such a setting can be modelled as an exponential distribution with the mean C = c · G · log G, where the constant c 0.17 for G ≥ 25.",
        "The meeting time, or equivalently the availability latency δi, for the client requesting data item i is the time till it encounters any of these ri replicas for the first time.",
        "This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value (note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G >> ri): δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items, weighted by their frequency of access: δagg(no − zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri = T i=1 fi · C ri (2) 77 4.1 One-instantaneous zebroids Recall that with one-instantaneous zebroids, for a given request, a new replica is created on a car in the vicinity of the server, provided this car meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.",
        "Moreover, this replica is spawned at the time step when the client issues the request.",
        "Let Nc i be the expected total number of nodes that are in the same cell as any of the ri servers.",
        "Then, we have Nc i = (N − ri) · (1 − (1 − 1 G )ri ) (3) In the analytical model, we assume that Nc i new replicas are created, so that the total number of replicas is increased to ri +Nc i .",
        "The availability latency is reduced since the client is more likely to meet a replica earlier.",
        "The aggregated expected availability latency in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).",
        "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
        "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
        "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
        "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
        "This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",
        "Details of the procedure to obtain a closed-form expression are given in [9].",
        "The aggregate availability latency (δagg) with z-relay zebroids is given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 [fi · C N + 1 · 1 N + 1 − ri · (N · log N ri − log (N + 1 − ri))] (5) 5.",
        "SIMULATION METHODOLOGY The simulation environment considered in this study comprises of vehicles such as cars that carry a fraction of the data item repository.",
        "A prediction accuracy parameter inherently provides a certain probabilistic guarantee on the confidence of the car route predictions known at the dispatcher.",
        "A value of 100% implies that the exact routes of all cars are known at all times.",
        "A 70% value for this parameter indicates that the routes predicted for the cars will match the actual ones with probability 0.7.",
        "Note that this probability is spread across the car routes for the entire trip duration.",
        "We now provide the preliminaries of the simulation study and then describe the parameter settings used in our experiments. • Similar to the analysis methodology, the map used is a 2D torus.",
        "A Markov mobility model representing a unbiased 2D random walk on the surface of the torus describes the movement of the cars across this torus. • Each grid/cell is a unique state of this Markov chain.",
        "In each time slot, every car makes a transition from a cell to any of its neighboring 8 cells.",
        "The transition is a function of the current location of the car and a probability transition matrix Q = [qij] where qij is the probability of transition from state i to state j.",
        "Only AutoMata equipped cars within the same cell may communicate with each other. • The parameters γ, δ have been discretized and expressed in terms of the number of time slots. • An AutoMata device does not maintain more than one replica of a data item.",
        "This is because additional replicas occupy storage without providing benefits. • Either one-instantaneous or z-relay zebroids may be employed per client request for latency improvement. • Unless otherwise mentioned, the prediction accuracy parameter is assumed to be 100%.",
        "This is because this study aims to quantify the effect of a large number of parameters individually on availability latency.",
        "Here, we set the size of every data item, Si, to be 1. α represents the number of storage slots per AutoMata.",
        "Each storage slot stores one data item. γ represents the duration of the clients journey in terms of the number of time slots.",
        "Hence the possible values of availability latency are between 0 and γ. δ is defined as the number of time slots after which a client AutoMata device will encounter a replica of the data item for the first time.",
        "If a replica for the data item requested was encountered by the client in the first cell then we set δ = 0.",
        "If δ > γ then we set δ = γ indicating that no copy of the requested data item was encountered by the client during its entire journey.",
        "In all our simulations, for illustration we consider a 5 × 5 2D-torus with γ set to 10.",
        "Our experiments indicate that the trends in the results scale to maps of larger size.",
        "We simulated a skewed distribution of access to the T data items that obeys Zipfs law with a mean of 0.27.",
        "This distribution is shown to correspond to sale of movie theater tickets in the United States [6].",
        "We employ a replication scheme that allocates replicas for a data item as a function of the square-root of the frequency of access of that item.",
        "The square-root replication scheme is shown to have competitive latency performance over a large parameter space [8].",
        "The data item replicas are distributed uniformly across the AutoMata devices.",
        "This serves as the base-line no-zebroids case.",
        "The square-root scheme also provides the initial replica distribution when zebroids are employed.",
        "Note that the replacements performed by the zebroids will cause changes to the data item replica distribution.",
        "Requests generated as per the Zipf distribution are issued one at a time.",
        "The client car that issues the request is chosen in a round-robin manner.",
        "After a maximum period of γ, the latency encountered by this request is recorded.",
        "In all the simulation results, each point is an average of 200,000 requests.",
        "Moreover, the 95% confidence intervals determined for the results are quite tight for the metrics of latency and replacement overhead.",
        "Hence, we only present them for the metric that captures the percentage improvement in latency with respect to the no-zebroids case. 6.",
        "RESULTS In this section, we describe our evaluation results where the following key questions are addressed.",

        "What inherent trade-offs exist between car density and storage per car with regards to their combined as well as individual effect on availability latency in the presence of zebroids?",
        "We present both simple analysis and detailed simulations to provide answers to these questions as well as gain insights into design of carrier-based systems. 6.1 How does a replacement scheme employed by a zebroid impact availability latency?",
        "For illustration, we present scale-up experiments where oneinstantaneous zebroids are employed (see Figure 1).",
        "By scale-up, we mean that α and N are changed proportionally to keep the total system storage, ST , constant.",
        "Here, T = 50 and ST = 200.",
        "We choose the following values of (N,α) = {(20,10), (25,8), (50,4), (100,2)}.",
        "The figure indicates that a random replacement scheme shows competitive performance.",
        "This is because of several reasons.",
        "Recall that the initial replica distribution is set as per the squareroot replication scheme.",
        "The random replacement scheme does not alter this distribution since it makes replacements blind to the popularity of a data item.",
        "However, the replacements cause dynamic data re-organization so as to better serve the currently active request.",
        "Moreover, the mobility pattern of the cars is random, hence, the locations from which the requests are issued by clients are also random and not known a priori at the dispatcher.",
        "These findings are significant because a random replacement policy can be implemented in a simple decentralized manner.",
        "The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.",
        "This is because these policies rapidly develop a preference for the more popular data items thereby creating a larger number of replicas for them.",
        "During eviction, the more popular data items are almost never selected as a replacement candidate.",
        "Consequently, there are fewer replicas for the less popular items.",
        "Hence, the initial distribution of the data item replicas changes from square-root to that resembling linear replication.",
        "The higher number of replicas for the popular data items provide marginal additional benefits, while the lower number of replicas for the other data items hurts the latency performance of these global policies.",
        "The lfu-local and lru-local schemes have similar performance to random since they do not have enough history of local data item requests.",
        "We speculate that the performance of these local policies will approach that of their global variants for a large enough history of data item requests.",
        "On account of the competitive performance shown by a random policy, for the remainder of the paper, we present the performance of zebroids that employ a random replacement policy. 6.2 Do zebroids provide significant improvements in availability latency?",
        "We find that in many scenarios employing zebroids provides substantial improvements in availability latency. 6.2.1 Analysis We first consider the case of one-instantaneous zebroids.",
        "Figure 2.a shows the variation in δagg as a function of N for T = 10 and α = 1 with a 10 × 10 torus using Equation 4.",
        "Both the x and y axes are drawn to a log-scale.",
        "Figure 2.b show the % improvement in δagg obtained with one-instantaneous zebroids.",
        "In this case, only the x-axis is drawn to a log-scale.",
        "For illustration, we assume that the T data items are requested uniformly.",
        "Initially, when the network is sparse the analytical approximation for improvements in latency with zebroids, obtained from Equations 2 and 4, closely matches the simulation results.",
        "However, as N increases, the sparseness assumption for which the analysis is valid, namely N << G, is no longer true.",
        "Hence, the two curves rapidly diverge.",
        "The point at which the two curves move away from each other corresponds to a value of δagg ≤ 1.",
        "Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the analysis provides an upper bound on the latency improvements, as it treats the newly created replicas given by Nc i independently.",
        "However, these Nc i replicas start from the same cell as one of the server replicas ri.",
        "Finally, the analysis captures a oneshot scenario where given an initial data item replica distribution, the availability latency is computed.",
        "The new replicas created do not affect future requests from the client.",
        "On account of space limitations, here, we summarize the observations in the case when z-relay zebroids are employed.",
        "The interested reader can obtain further details in [9].",
        "Similar observations, like the one-instantaneous zebroid case, apply since the simulation and analysis curves again start diverging when the analysis assumptions are no longer valid.",
        "However, the key observation here is that the latency improvement with z-relay zebroids is significantly better than the one-instantaneous zebroids case, especially for lower storage scenarios.",
        "This is because in sparse scenarios, the transitive hand-offs between the zebroids creates higher number of replicas for the requested data item, yielding lower availability latency.",
        "Moreover, it is also seen that the simulation validation curve for the improvements in δagg with z-relay zebroids approaches that of the one-instantaneous zebroid case for higher storage (higher N values).",
        "This is because one-instantaneous zebroids are a special case of z-relay zebroids. 6.2.2 Simulation We conduct simulations to examine the entire storage spectrum obtained by changing car density N or storage per car α to also capture scenarios where the sparseness assumptions for which the analysis is valid do not hold.",
        "We separate the effect of N and α by capturing the variation of N while keeping α constant (case 1) and vice-versa (case 2) both with z-relay and one-instantaneous zebroids.",
        "Here, we set the repository size as T = 25.",
        "Figure 3 captures case 1 mentioned above.",
        "Similar trends are observed with case 2, a complete description of those results are available in [9].",
        "With Figure 3.b, keeping α constant, initially increasing car density has higher latency benefits because increasing N introduces more zebroids in the system.",
        "As N is further increased, ω reduces because the total storage in the system goes up.",
        "Consequently, the number of replicas per data item goes up thereby increasing the 79 number of servers.",
        "Hence, the replacement policy cannot find a zebroid as often to transport the requested data item to the client earlier than any of the servers.",
        "On the other hand, the increased number of servers benefits the no-zebroids case in bringing δagg down.",
        "The net effect results in reduction in ω for larger values of N. 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 Number of cars no−zebroidsanal no−zebroids sim one−instantaneous anal one−instantaneoussim Aggregate Availability latency (δagg ) 2.a) δagg 10 1 10 2 10 3 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Number of cars % Improvement in δagg wrt no−zebroids (ω) analytical upper−bound simulation 2.b) ω Figure 2: Figure 2 shows the latency performance with oneinstantaneous zebroids via simulations along with the analytical approximation for a 10 × 10 torus with T = 10.",
        "The trends mentioned above are similar to that obtained from the analysis.",
        "However, somewhat counter-intuitively with relatively higher system storage, z-relay zebroids provide slightly lower improvements in latency as compared to one-instantaneous zebroids.",
        "We speculate that this is due to the different data item replica distributions enforced by them.",
        "Note that replacements performed by the zebroids cause fluctuations in these replica distributions which may effect future client requests.",
        "We are currently exploring suitable choices of parameters that can capture these changing replica distributions. 6.3 What is the overhead incurred with improvements in latency with zebroids?",
        "We find that the improvements in latency with zebroids are obtained at a minimal replacement overhead (< 1 per client request). 6.3.1 Analysis With one-instantaneous zebroids, for each client request a maximum of one zebroid is employed for latency improvement.",
        "Hence, the replacement overhead per client request can amount to a maximum of one.",
        "Recall that to calculate the latency with one-instantaneous 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Number of cars Aggregate availability latency (δagg ) no−zebroids one−instantaneous z−relays 3.a 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Number of cars % Improvement in δagg wrt no−zebroids (ω) one−instantaneous z−relays 3.b Figure 3: Figure 3 depicts the latency performance with both one-instantaneous and z-relay zebroids as a function of the car density when α = 2 and T = 25. zebroids, Nc i new replicas are created in the same cell as the servers.",
        "Now a replacement is only incurred if one of these Nc i newly created replicas meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.",
        "Let Xri and XNc i respectively be random variables that capture the minimum time till any of the ri and Nc i replicas meet the client.",
        "Since Xri and XNc i are assumed to be independent, by the property of exponentially distributed random variables we have, Overhead/request = 1 · P(XNc i < Xri ) + 0 · P(Xri ≤ XNc i ) (6) Overhead/request = ri C ri C + Nc i C = ri ri + Nc i (7) Recall that the number of replicas for data item i, ri, is a function of the total storage in the system i.e., ri = k·N ·α where k satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ ri ≤ N. Using this along with Equation 2, we get Overhead/request = 1 − G G + N · (1 − k · α) (8) Now if we keep the total system storage N · α constant since G and T are also constant, increasing N increases the replacement overhead.",

        "This implies that a higher replacement overhead is incurred for higher N and lower α values.",
        "Moreover, when ri = N, this means that every car has a replica of data item i.",
        "Hence, no zebroids are employed when this item is requested, yielding an overhead/request for this item as zero.",
        "Next, we present simulation results that validate our analysis hypothesis for the overhead associated with deployment of one-instantaneous zebroids. 6.3.2 Simulation Figure 4 shows the replacement overhead with one-instantaneous zebroids when (N,α) are varied while keeping the total system storage constant.",
        "The trends shown by the simulation are in agreement with those predicted by the analysis above.",
        "However, the total system storage can be changed either by varying car density (N) or storage per car (α).",
        "On account of similar trends, here we present the case when α is kept constant and N is varied (Figure 5).",
        "We refer the reader to [9] for the case when α is varied and N is held constant.",
        "We present an intuitive argument for the behavior of the perrequest replacement overhead curves.",
        "When the storage is extremely scarce so that only one replica per data item exists in the AutoMata network, the number of replacements performed by the zebroids is zero since any replacement will cause a data item to be lost from the system.",
        "The dispatcher ensures that no data item is lost from the system.",
        "At the other end of the spectrum, if storage becomes so abundant that α = T then the entire data item repository can be replicated on every car.",
        "The number of replacements is again zero since each request can be satisfied locally.",
        "A similar scenario occurs if N is increased to such a large value that another car with the requested data item is always available in the vicinity of the client.",
        "However, there is a storage spectrum in the middle where replacements by the scheduled zebroids result in improvements in δagg (see Figure 3).",
        "Moreover, we observe that for sparse storage scenarios, the higher improvements with z-relay zebroids are obtained at the cost of a higher replacement overhead when compared to the one-instantaneous zebroids case.",
        "This is because in the former case, each of these z zebroids selected along the lowest latency path to the client needs to perform a replacement.",
        "However, the replacement overhead is still less than 1 indicating that on an average less than one replacement per client request is needed even when z-relay zebroids are employed. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Number of cars z−relays one−instantaneous Average number of replacements per request Figure 5: Figure 5 shows the replacement overhead with zebroids for the cases when N is varied keeping α = 2. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 Prediction percentage no−zebroids (N=50) one−instantaneous (N=50) z−relays (N=50) no−zebroids (N=200) one−instantaneous (N=200) z−relays (N=200) Aggregate Availability Latency (δagg ) Figure 6: Figure 6 shows δagg for different car densities as a function of the prediction accuracy metric with α = 2 and T = 25. 6.4 What happens to the availability latency with zebroids in scenarios with inaccuracies in the car route predictions?",
        "We find that zebroids continue to provide improvements in availability latency even with lower accuracy in the car route predictions.",
        "We use a single parameter p to quantify the accuracy of the car route predictions. 6.4.1 Analysis Since p represents the probability that a car route predicted by the dispatcher matches the actual one, hence, the latency with zebroids can be approximated by, δerr agg = p · δagg(zeb) + (1 − p) · δagg(no − zeb) (9) δerr agg = p · δagg(zeb) + (1 − p) · C ri (10) Expressions for δagg(zeb) can be obtained from Equations 4 (one-instantaneous) or 5 (z-relay zebroids). 6.4.2 Simulation Figure 6 shows the variation in δagg as a function of this route prediction accuracy metric.",
        "We observe a smooth reduction in the 81 improvement in δagg as the prediction accuracy metric reduces.",
        "For zebroids that are scheduled but fail to rendezvous with the client due to the prediction error, we tag any such replacements made by the zebroids as failed.",
        "It is seen that failed replacements gradually increase as the prediction accuracy reduces. 6.5 Under what conditions are the improvements in availability latency with zebroids maximized?",
        "Surprisingly, we find that the improvements in latency obtained with one-instantaneous zebroids are independent of the input distribution of the popularity of the data items. 6.5.1 Analysis The fractional difference (labelled ω) in the latency between the no-zebroids and one-instantaneous zebroids is obtained from equations 2, 3, and 4 as ω = T i=1 fi·C ri − T i=1 fi·C ri+(N−ri)·(1−(1− 1 G )ri ) T i=1 fi·C ri (11) Here C = c·G·log G. This captures the fractional improvement in the availability latency obtained by employing one-instantaneous zebroids.",
        "Let α = 1, making the total storage in the system ST = N. Assuming the initial replica distribution is as per the squareroot replication scheme, we have, ri = √ fi·N T j=1 √ fj .",
        "Hence, we get fi = K2 ·r2 i N2 , where K = T j=1 fj.",
        "Using this, along with the approximation (1 − x)n 1 − n · x for small x, we simplify the above equation to get, ω = 1 − T i=1 ri 1+ N−ri G T i=1 ri In order to determine when the gains with one-instantaneous zebroids are maximized, we can frame an optimization problem as follows: Maximize ω, subject to T i=1 ri = ST THEOREM 1.",
        "With a square-root replication scheme, improvements obtained with one-instantaneous zebroids are independent of the input popularity distribution of the data items. (See [9] for proof) 6.5.2 Simulation We perform simulations with two different frequency distribution of data items: Uniform and Zipfian (with mean= 0.27).",
        "Similar latency improvements with one-instantaneous zebroids are obtained in both cases.",
        "This result has important implications.",
        "In cases with biased popularity toward certain data items, the aggregate improvements in latency across all data item requests still remain the same.",
        "Even in scenarios where the frequency of access to the data items changes dynamically, zebroids will continue to provide similar latency improvements. 7.",
        "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS In this study, we examined the improvements in latency that can be obtained in the presence of carriers that deliver a data item from a server to a client.",
        "We quantified the variation in availability latency as a function of a rich set of parameters such as car density, storage per car, title database size, and replacement policies employed by zebroids.",
        "Below we summarize some key future research directions we intend to pursue.",
        "To better reflect reality we would like to validate the observations obtained from this study with some real world simulation traces of vehicular movements (for example using CORSIM [1]).",
        "This will also serve as a validation for the utility of the Markov mobility model used in this study.",
        "We are currently analyzing the performance of zebroids on a real world data set comprising of an ad-hoc network of buses moving around a small neighborhood in Amherst [4].",

                "Note that the latency along the quickest delivery path that employs a relay team of z zebroids is similar to that obtained with epidemic routing [19] under the assumptions of infinite storage and no interference.",
                "A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the clients request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity.",
                "Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid.",
                "In some cases, the dispatcher might have inaccurate information about the routes of the cars.",
                "Hence, a zebroid scheduled on the basis of this inaccurate information may not rendezvous with its target client.",
                "To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids.",
                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
                "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",
                "With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane.",
                "Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner.",
                "This remains a future research direction.",
                "Initially, number of replicas for each data item replicas might be computed using Equation 1.",
                "This scheme computes the number of data item replicas as a function of their popularity.",

                "When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item.",
                "For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.",
                "This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18].",
                "The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random).",

                "First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy.",
                "Second, the bandwidth used to transfer a copy of a data item from a server to the zebroid.",

                "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
                "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids.",

                "Although for sparse density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it is no longer valid when N approaches G. • Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also, data item i has ri replicas.",
                "This implies ri cars, identified as servers, have a copy of this data item when the client requests item i.",
                "All analysis results presented in this section are obtained assuming that the client is willing to wait as long as it takes for its request to be satisfied (unbounded trip duration γ = ∞).",
                "With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2].",

                "Consider a scenario where no zebroids are employed.",
                "In this case, the expected availability latency for the data item is the expected meeting time of the random walk undertaken by the client with any of the random walks performed by the servers.",
                "Aldous et al. [2] show that the the meeting time of two random walks in such a setting can be modelled as an exponential distribution with the mean C = c · G · log G, where the constant c 0.17 for G ≥ 25.",
                "The meeting time, or equivalently the availability latency δi, for the client requesting data item i is the time till it encounters any of these ri replicas for the first time.",
                "This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value (note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G >> ri): δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items, weighted by their frequency of access: δagg(no − zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri = T i=1 fi · C ri (2) 77 4.1 One-instantaneous zebroids Recall that with one-instantaneous zebroids, for a given request, a new replica is created on a car in the vicinity of the server, provided this car meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.",
                "Moreover, this replica is spawned at the time step when the client issues the request.",
                "Let Nc i be the expected total number of nodes that are in the same cell as any of the ri servers.",
                "Then, we have Nc i = (N − ri) · (1 − (1 − 1 G )ri ) (3) In the analytical model, we assume that Nc i new replicas are created, so that the total number of replicas is increased to ri +Nc i .",
                "The availability latency is reduced since the client is more likely to meet a replica earlier.",
                "The aggregated expected availability latency in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).",
                "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
                "This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",
                "Details of the procedure to obtain a closed-form expression are given in [9].",

                "This is because this study aims to quantify the effect of a large number of parameters individually on availability latency.",

                "Each storage slot stores one data item. γ represents the duration of the clients journey in terms of the number of time slots.",
                "Hence the possible values of availability latency are between 0 and γ. δ is defined as the number of time slots after which a client AutoMata device will encounter a replica of the data item for the first time.",

                "The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.",

                "The higher number of replicas for the popular data items provide marginal additional benefits, while the lower number of replicas for the other data items hurts the latency performance of these global policies.",

                "Our target environment uses data carriers, termed zebroids, where a mobile device carries a data item on behalf of a server to a client thereby minimizing its availability latency.",
                "In this study, we quantify the variation in availability latency with zebroids as a function of a rich set of parameters such as car density, storage per device, repository size, and replacement policies employed by zebroids.",
                "Using analysis and extensive simulations, we gain novel insights into the design of carrier-based systems.",
                "Significant improvements in latency can be obtained with zebroids at the cost of a minimal overhead.",
                "These improvements occur even in scenarios with lower accuracy in the predictions of the car routes.",
                "Two particularly surprising findings are: (1) a naive random replacement policy employed by the zebroids shows competitive performance, and (2) latency improvements obtained with a simplified instantiation of zebroids are found to be robust to changes in the popularity distribution of the data items.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors: C.2.4 [Distributed Systems]: Client/Server General Terms: Algorithms, Performance, Design, Experimentation. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Technological advances in areas of storage and wireless communications have now made it feasible to envision on-demand delivery of data items, for e.g., video and audio clips, in vehicular peer-topeer networks.",
                "In prior work, Ghandeharizadeh et al. [10] introduce the concept of vehicles equipped with a Car-to-Car-Peer-toPeer device, termed AutoMata, for in-vehicle entertainment.",
                "The notable features of an AutoMata include a mass storage device offering hundreds of gigabytes (GB) of storage, a fast processor, and several types of networking cards.",
                "Even with todays 500 GB disk drives, a repository of diverse entertainment content may exceed the storage capacity of a single AutoMata.",
                "Such repositories constitute the focus of this study.",
                "To exchange data, we assume each AutoMata is configured with two types of networking cards: 1) a low-bandwidth networking card with a long radio-range in the order of miles that enables an AutoMata device to communicate with a nearby cellular or WiMax station, 2) a high-bandwidth networking card with a limited radio-range in the order of hundreds of feet.",
                "The high bandwidth connection supports data rates in the order of tens to hundreds of Megabits per second and represents the ad-hoc peer to peer network between the vehicles.",
                "This is labelled as the data plane and is employed to exchange data items between devices.",
                "The low-bandwidth connection serves as the control plane, enabling AutoMata devices to exchange meta-data with one or more centralized servers.",
                "This connection offers bandwidths in the order of tens to hundreds of Kilobits per second.",
                "The centralized servers, termed dispatchers, compute schedules of data delivery along the data plane using the provided meta-data.",
                "These schedules are transmitted to the participating vehicles using the control plane.",
                "The technical feasibility of such a two-tier architecture is presented in [7], with preliminary results to demonstrate the bandwidth of the control plane is sufficient for exchange of control information needed for realizing such an application.",
                "In a typical scenario, an AutoMata device presents a passenger with a list of data items1 , showing both the name of each data item and its availability latency.",
                "The latter, denoted as δ, is defined as the earliest time at which the client encounters a copy of its requested data item.",
                "A data item is available immediately when it resides in the local storage of the AutoMata device serving the request.",
                "Due to storage constraints, an AutoMata may not store the entire repository.",
                "In this case, availability latency is the time from when the user issues a request until when the AutoMata encounters another car containing the referenced data item. (The terms car and AutoMata are used interchangeably in this study.)",
                "The availability latency for an item is a function of the current location of the client, its destination and travel path, the mobility model of the AutoMata equipped vehicles, the number of replicas constructed for the different data items, and the placement of data item replicas across the vehicles.",
                "A method to improve the availability latency is to employ data carriers which transport a replica of the requested data item from a server car containing it to a client that requested it.",
                "These data carriers are termed zebroids.",
                "Selection of zebroids is facilitated by the two-tiered architecture.",
                "The control plane enables centralized information gathering at a dispatcher present at a base-station.2 Some examples of control in1 Without loss of generality, the term data item might be either traditional media such as text or continuous media such as an audio or video clip. 2 There may be dispatchers deployed at a subset of the base-stations for fault-tolerance and robustness.",
                "Dispatchers between basestations may communicate via the wired infrastructure. 75 formation are currently active requests, travel path of the clients and their destinations, and paths of the other cars.",
                "For each client request, the dispatcher may choose a set of z carriers that collaborate to transfer a data item from a server to a client (z-relay zebroids).",
                "Here, z is the number of zebroids such that 0 ≤ z < N, where N is the total number of cars.",
                "When z = 0 there are no carriers, requiring a server to deliver the data item directly to the client.",
                "Otherwise, the chosen relay team of z zebroids hand over the data item transitively to one another to arrive at the client, thereby reducing availability latency (see Section 3.1 for details).",
                "To increase robustness, the dispatcher may employ multiple relay teams of z-carriers for every request.",
                "This may be useful in scenarios where the dispatcher has lower prediction accuracy in the information about the routes of the cars.",
                "Finally, storage constraints may require a zebroid to evict existing data items from its local storage to accommodate the client requested item.",
                "In this study, we quantify the following main factors that affect availability latency in the presence of zebroids: (i) data item repository size, (ii) car density, (iii) storage capacity per car, (iv) client trip duration, (v) replacement scheme employed by the zebroids, and (vi) accuracy of the car route predictions.",
                "For a significant subset of these factors, we address some key questions pertaining to use of zebroids both via analysis and extensive simulations.",
                "Our main findings are as follows.",
                "A naive random replacement policy employed by the zebroids shows competitive performance in terms of availability latency.",
                "With such a policy, substantial improvements in latency can be obtained with zebroids at a minimal replacement overhead.",
                "In more practical scenarios, where the dispatcher has inaccurate information about the car routes, zebroids continue to provide latency improvements.",
                "A surprising result is that changes in popularity of the data items do not impact the latency gains obtained with a simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids called one-instantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "This study suggests a number of interesting directions to be pursued to gain better understanding of design of carrier-based systems that improve availability latency.",
                "Related Work: Replication in mobile ad-hoc networks has been a widely studied topic [11, 12, 15].",
                "However, none of these studies employ zebroids as data carriers to reduce the latency of the clients requests.",
                "Several novel and important studies such as ZebraNet [13], DakNet [14], Data Mules [16], Message Ferries [20], and Seek and Focus [17] have analyzed factors impacting intermittently connected networks consisting of data carriers similar in spirit to zebroids.",
                "Factors considered by each study are dictated by their assumed environment and target application.",
                "A novel characteristic of our study is the impact on availability latency for a given database repository of items.",
                "A detailed description of related works can be obtained in [9].",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 provides an overview of the terminology along with the factors that impact availability latency in the presence of zebroids.",
                "Section 3 describes how the zebroids may be employed.",
                "Section 4 provides details of the analysis methodology employed to capture the performance with zebroids.",
                "Section 5 describes the details of the simulation environment used for evaluation.",
                "Section 6 enlists the key questions examined in this study and answers them via analysis and simulations.",

                "The frequency of access to data item i is denoted as fi, with T j=1 fj = 1.",
                "Let the trip duration of the client AutoMata under consideration be γ.",
                "We now define the normalized frequency of access to the data item i, denoted by Ri, as: Ri = (fi)n T j=1(fj)n ; 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞ (1) The exponent n characterizes a particular replication technique.",
                "A square-root replication scheme is realized when n = 0.5 [5].",
                "This serves as the base-line for comparison with the case when zebroids are deployed.",
                "Ri is normalized to a value between 0 and 1.",
                "The number of replicas for data item i, denoted as ri, is: ri = min (N, max (1, Ri·N·α Si )).",
                "This captures the case when at least one copy of every data item must be present in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In cases where a data item may be lost from the ad-hoc network, this equation becomes ri = min (N, max (0, Ri·N·α Si )).",
                "In this case, a request for the lost data item may need to be satisfied by fetching the item from a remote server.",
                "The availability latency for a data item i, denoted as δi, is defined as the earliest time at which a client AutoMata will find the first replica of the item accessible to it.",
                "If this condition is not satisfied, then we set δi to γ.",
                "This indicates that data item i was not available to the client during its journey.",
                "Note that since there is at least one replica in the system for every data item i, by setting γ to a large value we ensure that the clients request for any data item i will be satisfied.",
                "However, in most practical circumstances γ may not be so large as to find every data item.",
                "We are interested in the availability latency observed across all data items.",
                "Hence, we augment the average availability latency for every data item i with its fi to obtain the following weighted availability latency (δagg) metric: δagg = T i=1 δi · fi Next, we present our solution approach describing how zebroids are selected. 3.",
                "SOLUTION APPROACH 3.1 Zebroids When a client references a data item missing from its local storage, the dispatcher identifies all cars with a copy of the data item as servers.",
                "Next, the dispatcher obtains the future routes of all cars for a finite time duration equivalent to the maximum time the client is willing to wait for its request to be serviced.",
                "Using this information, the dispatcher schedules the quickest delivery path from any of the servers to the client using any other cars as intermediate carriers.",
                "Hence, it determines the optimal set of forwarding decisions 76 that will enable the data item to be delivered to the client in the minimum amount of time.",
                "Note that the latency along the quickest delivery path that employs a relay team of z zebroids is similar to that obtained with epidemic routing [19] under the assumptions of infinite storage and no interference.",
                "A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the clients request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity.",
                "Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid.",
                "In some cases, the dispatcher might have inaccurate information about the routes of the cars.",
                "Hence, a zebroid scheduled on the basis of this inaccurate information may not rendezvous with its target client.",
                "To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids.",
                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
                "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",
                "With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane.",
                "Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner.",
                "This remains a future research direction.",
                "Initially, number of replicas for each data item replicas might be computed using Equation 1.",
                "This scheme computes the number of data item replicas as a function of their popularity.",
                "It is static because number of replicas in the system do not change and no replacements are performed.",
                "Hence, this is referred to as the nozebroids environment.",
                "We quantify the performance of the various replacement policies with reference to this base-line that does not employ zebroids.",
                "One may assume a cold start phase, where initially only one or few copies of every data item exist in the system.",
                "Many storage slots of the cars may be unoccupied.",
                "When the cars encounter one another they construct new replicas of some selected data items to occupy the empty slots.",
                "The selection procedure may be to choose the data items uniformly at random.",
                "New replicas are created as long as a car has a certain threshold of its storage unoccupied.",
                "Eventually, majority of the storage capacity of a car will be exhausted. 3.2 Carrier-based Replacement policies The replacement policies considered in this paper are reactive since a replacement occurs only in response to a request issued for a certain data item.",
                "When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item.",
                "For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.",
                "This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18].",
                "The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random).",
                "We have considered local and global variants of the LRU/LFU policies which determine whether local or global knowledge of contents of the cars known at the dispatcher is used for the eviction decision at a zebroid (see [9] for more details).",
                "The replacement policies incur the following overheads.",
                "First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy.",
                "Second, the bandwidth used to transfer a copy of a data item from a server to the zebroid.",
                "Third, the average number of replacements incurred by the zebroids.",
                "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
                "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids.",
                "First, we present some preliminaries of our analysis methodology. • Let N be the number of cars in the network performing a 2D random walk on a √ G× √ G torus.",
                "An additional car serves as a client yielding a total of N + 1 cars.",
                "Such a mobility model has been used widely in the literature [17, 16] chiefly because it is amenable to analysis and provides a baseline against which performance of other mobility models can be compared.",
                "Moreover, this class of Markovian mobility models has been used to model the movements of vehicles [3, 21]. • We assume that all cars start from the stationary distribution and perform independent random walks.",
                "Although for sparse density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it is no longer valid when N approaches G. • Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also, data item i has ri replicas.",
                "This implies ri cars, identified as servers, have a copy of this data item when the client requests item i.",
                "All analysis results presented in this section are obtained assuming that the client is willing to wait as long as it takes for its request to be satisfied (unbounded trip duration γ = ∞).",
                "With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2].",
                "Extensions to the analysis that also consider finite trip durations can be obtained in [9].",
                "Consider a scenario where no zebroids are employed.",
                "In this case, the expected availability latency for the data item is the expected meeting time of the random walk undertaken by the client with any of the random walks performed by the servers.",
                "Aldous et al. [2] show that the the meeting time of two random walks in such a setting can be modelled as an exponential distribution with the mean C = c · G · log G, where the constant c 0.17 for G ≥ 25.",
                "The meeting time, or equivalently the availability latency δi, for the client requesting data item i is the time till it encounters any of these ri replicas for the first time.",
                "This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value (note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G >> ri): δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items, weighted by their frequency of access: δagg(no − zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri = T i=1 fi · C ri (2) 77 4.1 One-instantaneous zebroids Recall that with one-instantaneous zebroids, for a given request, a new replica is created on a car in the vicinity of the server, provided this car meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.",
                "Moreover, this replica is spawned at the time step when the client issues the request.",
                "Let Nc i be the expected total number of nodes that are in the same cell as any of the ri servers.",
                "Then, we have Nc i = (N − ri) · (1 − (1 − 1 G )ri ) (3) In the analytical model, we assume that Nc i new replicas are created, so that the total number of replicas is increased to ri +Nc i .",
                "The availability latency is reduced since the client is more likely to meet a replica earlier.",
                "The aggregated expected availability latency in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).",
                "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
                "This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",
                "Details of the procedure to obtain a closed-form expression are given in [9].",
                "The aggregate availability latency (δagg) with z-relay zebroids is given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 [fi · C N + 1 · 1 N + 1 − ri · (N · log N ri − log (N + 1 − ri))] (5) 5.",
                "SIMULATION METHODOLOGY The simulation environment considered in this study comprises of vehicles such as cars that carry a fraction of the data item repository.",
                "A prediction accuracy parameter inherently provides a certain probabilistic guarantee on the confidence of the car route predictions known at the dispatcher.",
                "A value of 100% implies that the exact routes of all cars are known at all times.",
                "A 70% value for this parameter indicates that the routes predicted for the cars will match the actual ones with probability 0.7.",

                "Recall that the initial replica distribution is set as per the squareroot replication scheme.",
                "The random replacement scheme does not alter this distribution since it makes replacements blind to the popularity of a data item.",

                "These findings are significant because a random replacement policy can be implemented in a simple decentralized manner.",
                "The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.",

                "Consequently, there are fewer replicas for the less popular items.",

                "The higher number of replicas for the popular data items provide marginal additional benefits, while the lower number of replicas for the other data items hurts the latency performance of these global policies.",
                "The lfu-local and lru-local schemes have similar performance to random since they do not have enough history of local data item requests.",

                "Hence, the two curves rapidly diverge.",
                "The point at which the two curves move away from each other corresponds to a value of δagg ≤ 1.",
                "Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the analysis provides an upper bound on the latency improvements, as it treats the newly created replicas given by Nc i independently.",
                "However, these Nc i replicas start from the same cell as one of the server replicas ri.",
                "Finally, the analysis captures a oneshot scenario where given an initial data item replica distribution, the availability latency is computed.",

                "Consequently, the number of replicas per data item goes up thereby increasing the 79 number of servers.",

                "Two particularly surprising findings are: (1) a naive random replacement policy employed by the zebroids shows competitive performance, and (2) latency improvements obtained with a simplified instantiation of zebroids are found to be robust to changes in the popularity distribution of the data items.",

                "INTRODUCTION Technological advances in areas of storage and wireless communications have now made it feasible to envision on-demand delivery of data items, for e.g., video and audio clips, in vehicular peer-topeer networks.",
                "In prior work, Ghandeharizadeh et al. [10] introduce the concept of vehicles equipped with a Car-to-Car-Peer-toPeer device, termed AutoMata, for in-vehicle entertainment.",

                "Such repositories constitute the focus of this study.",
                "To exchange data, we assume each AutoMata is configured with two types of networking cards: 1) a low-bandwidth networking card with a long radio-range in the order of miles that enables an AutoMata device to communicate with a nearby cellular or WiMax station, 2) a high-bandwidth networking card with a limited radio-range in the order of hundreds of feet.",
                "The high bandwidth connection supports data rates in the order of tens to hundreds of Megabits per second and represents the ad-hoc peer to peer network between the vehicles.",
                "This is labelled as the data plane and is employed to exchange data items between devices.",
                "The low-bandwidth connection serves as the control plane, enabling AutoMata devices to exchange meta-data with one or more centralized servers.",
                "This connection offers bandwidths in the order of tens to hundreds of Kilobits per second.",
                "The centralized servers, termed dispatchers, compute schedules of data delivery along the data plane using the provided meta-data.",
                "These schedules are transmitted to the participating vehicles using the control plane.",
                "The technical feasibility of such a two-tier architecture is presented in [7], with preliminary results to demonstrate the bandwidth of the control plane is sufficient for exchange of control information needed for realizing such an application.",
                "In a typical scenario, an AutoMata device presents a passenger with a list of data items1 , showing both the name of each data item and its availability latency.",
                "The latter, denoted as δ, is defined as the earliest time at which the client encounters a copy of its requested data item.",
                "A data item is available immediately when it resides in the local storage of the AutoMata device serving the request.",
                "Due to storage constraints, an AutoMata may not store the entire repository.",
                "In this case, availability latency is the time from when the user issues a request until when the AutoMata encounters another car containing the referenced data item. (The terms car and AutoMata are used interchangeably in this study.)",
                "The availability latency for an item is a function of the current location of the client, its destination and travel path, the mobility model of the AutoMata equipped vehicles, the number of replicas constructed for the different data items, and the placement of data item replicas across the vehicles.",
                "A method to improve the availability latency is to employ data carriers which transport a replica of the requested data item from a server car containing it to a client that requested it.",

                "Dispatchers between basestations may communicate via the wired infrastructure. 75 formation are currently active requests, travel path of the clients and their destinations, and paths of the other cars.",
                "For each client request, the dispatcher may choose a set of z carriers that collaborate to transfer a data item from a server to a client (z-relay zebroids).",

                "When z = 0 there are no carriers, requiring a server to deliver the data item directly to the client.",
                "Otherwise, the chosen relay team of z zebroids hand over the data item transitively to one another to arrive at the client, thereby reducing availability latency (see Section 3.1 for details).",
                "To increase robustness, the dispatcher may employ multiple relay teams of z-carriers for every request.",
                "This may be useful in scenarios where the dispatcher has lower prediction accuracy in the information about the routes of the cars.",
                "Finally, storage constraints may require a zebroid to evict existing data items from its local storage to accommodate the client requested item.",
                "In this study, we quantify the following main factors that affect availability latency in the presence of zebroids: (i) data item repository size, (ii) car density, (iii) storage capacity per car, (iv) client trip duration, (v) replacement scheme employed by the zebroids, and (vi) accuracy of the car route predictions.",
                "For a significant subset of these factors, we address some key questions pertaining to use of zebroids both via analysis and extensive simulations.",
                "Our main findings are as follows.",
                "A naive random replacement policy employed by the zebroids shows competitive performance in terms of availability latency.",
                "With such a policy, substantial improvements in latency can be obtained with zebroids at a minimal replacement overhead.",
                "In more practical scenarios, where the dispatcher has inaccurate information about the car routes, zebroids continue to provide latency improvements.",
                "A surprising result is that changes in popularity of the data items do not impact the latency gains obtained with a simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids called one-instantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "This study suggests a number of interesting directions to be pursued to gain better understanding of design of carrier-based systems that improve availability latency.",
                "Related Work: Replication in mobile ad-hoc networks has been a widely studied topic [11, 12, 15].",
                "However, none of these studies employ zebroids as data carriers to reduce the latency of the clients requests.",
                "Several novel and important studies such as ZebraNet [13], DakNet [14], Data Mules [16], Message Ferries [20], and Seek and Focus [17] have analyzed factors impacting intermittently connected networks consisting of data carriers similar in spirit to zebroids.",

                "Let the trip duration of the client AutoMata under consideration be γ.",
                "We now define the normalized frequency of access to the data item i, denoted by Ri, as: Ri = (fi)n T j=1(fj)n ; 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞ (1) The exponent n characterizes a particular replication technique.",
                "A square-root replication scheme is realized when n = 0.5 [5].",
                "This serves as the base-line for comparison with the case when zebroids are deployed.",
                "Ri is normalized to a value between 0 and 1.",
                "The number of replicas for data item i, denoted as ri, is: ri = min (N, max (1, Ri·N·α Si )).",
                "This captures the case when at least one copy of every data item must be present in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In cases where a data item may be lost from the ad-hoc network, this equation becomes ri = min (N, max (0, Ri·N·α Si )).",
                "In this case, a request for the lost data item may need to be satisfied by fetching the item from a remote server.",
                "The availability latency for a data item i, denoted as δi, is defined as the earliest time at which a client AutoMata will find the first replica of the item accessible to it.",
                "If this condition is not satisfied, then we set δi to γ.",
                "This indicates that data item i was not available to the client during its journey.",
                "Note that since there is at least one replica in the system for every data item i, by setting γ to a large value we ensure that the clients request for any data item i will be satisfied.",
                "However, in most practical circumstances γ may not be so large as to find every data item.",
                "We are interested in the availability latency observed across all data items.",
                "Hence, we augment the average availability latency for every data item i with its fi to obtain the following weighted availability latency (δagg) metric: δagg = T i=1 δi · fi Next, we present our solution approach describing how zebroids are selected. 3.",
                "SOLUTION APPROACH 3.1 Zebroids When a client references a data item missing from its local storage, the dispatcher identifies all cars with a copy of the data item as servers.",
                "Next, the dispatcher obtains the future routes of all cars for a finite time duration equivalent to the maximum time the client is willing to wait for its request to be serviced.",
                "Using this information, the dispatcher schedules the quickest delivery path from any of the servers to the client using any other cars as intermediate carriers.",
                "Hence, it determines the optimal set of forwarding decisions 76 that will enable the data item to be delivered to the client in the minimum amount of time.",
                "Note that the latency along the quickest delivery path that employs a relay team of z zebroids is similar to that obtained with epidemic routing [19] under the assumptions of infinite storage and no interference.",
                "A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the clients request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity.",
                "Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid.",
                "In some cases, the dispatcher might have inaccurate information about the routes of the cars.",
                "Hence, a zebroid scheduled on the basis of this inaccurate information may not rendezvous with its target client.",
                "To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids.",
                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
                "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",
                "With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane.",
                "Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner.",
                "This remains a future research direction.",
                "Initially, number of replicas for each data item replicas might be computed using Equation 1.",
                "This scheme computes the number of data item replicas as a function of their popularity.",
                "It is static because number of replicas in the system do not change and no replacements are performed.",
                "Hence, this is referred to as the nozebroids environment.",
                "We quantify the performance of the various replacement policies with reference to this base-line that does not employ zebroids.",
                "One may assume a cold start phase, where initially only one or few copies of every data item exist in the system.",
                "Many storage slots of the cars may be unoccupied.",
                "When the cars encounter one another they construct new replicas of some selected data items to occupy the empty slots.",
                "The selection procedure may be to choose the data items uniformly at random.",
                "New replicas are created as long as a car has a certain threshold of its storage unoccupied.",
                "Eventually, majority of the storage capacity of a car will be exhausted. 3.2 Carrier-based Replacement policies The replacement policies considered in this paper are reactive since a replacement occurs only in response to a request issued for a certain data item.",
                "When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item.",
                "For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.",
                "This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18].",
                "The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random).",
                "We have considered local and global variants of the LRU/LFU policies which determine whether local or global knowledge of contents of the cars known at the dispatcher is used for the eviction decision at a zebroid (see [9] for more details).",
                "The replacement policies incur the following overheads.",
                "First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy.",
                "Second, the bandwidth used to transfer a copy of a data item from a server to the zebroid.",
                "Third, the average number of replacements incurred by the zebroids.",
                "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
                "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids.",
                "First, we present some preliminaries of our analysis methodology. • Let N be the number of cars in the network performing a 2D random walk on a √ G× √ G torus.",
                "An additional car serves as a client yielding a total of N + 1 cars.",
                "Such a mobility model has been used widely in the literature [17, 16] chiefly because it is amenable to analysis and provides a baseline against which performance of other mobility models can be compared.",
                "Moreover, this class of Markovian mobility models has been used to model the movements of vehicles [3, 21]. • We assume that all cars start from the stationary distribution and perform independent random walks.",

                "Surprisingly, we find that the improvements in latency obtained with one-instantaneous zebroids are independent of the input distribution of the popularity of the data items. 6.5.1 Analysis The fractional difference (labelled ω) in the latency between the no-zebroids and one-instantaneous zebroids is obtained from equations 2, 3, and 4 as ω = T i=1 fi·C ri − T i=1 fi·C ri+(N−ri)·(1−(1− 1 G )ri ) T i=1 fi·C ri (11) Here C = c·G·log G. This captures the fractional improvement in the availability latency obtained by employing one-instantaneous zebroids.",
                "Let α = 1, making the total storage in the system ST = N. Assuming the initial replica distribution is as per the squareroot replication scheme, we have, ri = √ fi·N T j=1 √ fj .",
                "Hence, we get fi = K2 ·r2 i N2 , where K = T j=1 fj.",
                "Using this, along with the approximation (1 − x)n 1 − n · x for small x, we simplify the above equation to get, ω = 1 − T i=1 ri 1+ N−ri G T i=1 ri In order to determine when the gains with one-instantaneous zebroids are maximized, we can frame an optimization problem as follows: Maximize ω, subject to T i=1 ri = ST THEOREM 1.",
                "With a square-root replication scheme, improvements obtained with one-instantaneous zebroids are independent of the input popularity distribution of the data items. (See [9] for proof) 6.5.2 Simulation We perform simulations with two different frequency distribution of data items: Uniform and Zipfian (with mean= 0.27).",
                "Similar latency improvements with one-instantaneous zebroids are obtained in both cases.",
                "This result has important implications.",
                "In cases with biased popularity toward certain data items, the aggregate improvements in latency across all data item requests still remain the same.",
                "Even in scenarios where the frequency of access to the data items changes dynamically, zebroids will continue to provide similar latency improvements. 7.",

                "Eventually, majority of the storage capacity of a car will be exhausted. 3.2 Carrier-based Replacement policies The replacement policies considered in this paper are reactive since a replacement occurs only in response to a request issued for a certain data item.",
                "When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item.",
                "For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.",
                "This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18].",
                "The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random).",
                "We have considered local and global variants of the LRU/LFU policies which determine whether local or global knowledge of contents of the cars known at the dispatcher is used for the eviction decision at a zebroid (see [9] for more details).",

                "First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy.",

                "Third, the average number of replacements incurred by the zebroids.",
                "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
                "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",

                "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
                "This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",

                "Recall that the initial replica distribution is set as per the squareroot replication scheme.",
                "The random replacement scheme does not alter this distribution since it makes replacements blind to the popularity of a data item.",

                "These findings are significant because a random replacement policy can be implemented in a simple decentralized manner.",
                "The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.",

                "Consequently, there are fewer replicas for the less popular items.",

                "The higher number of replicas for the popular data items provide marginal additional benefits, while the lower number of replicas for the other data items hurts the latency performance of these global policies.",

                "The point at which the two curves move away from each other corresponds to a value of δagg ≤ 1.",
                "Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the analysis provides an upper bound on the latency improvements, as it treats the newly created replicas given by Nc i independently.",
                "However, these Nc i replicas start from the same cell as one of the server replicas ri.",
                "Finally, the analysis captures a oneshot scenario where given an initial data item replica distribution, the availability latency is computed.",
                "The new replicas created do not affect future requests from the client.",
                "On account of space limitations, here, we summarize the observations in the case when z-relay zebroids are employed.",

This captures the fractional improvement in the availability latency obtained by employing one-instantaneous zebroids.",

                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",

                "The aggregated expected availability latency in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).",
                "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
                "This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",

                "This is because of several reasons.",
                "Recall that the initial replica distribution is set as per the squareroot replication scheme.",
                "The random replacement scheme does not alter this distribution since it makes replacements blind to the popularity of a data item.",

                "These findings are significant because a random replacement policy can be implemented in a simple decentralized manner.",
                "The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.",

                "Consequently, there are fewer replicas for the less popular items.",

                "The higher number of replicas for the popular data items provide marginal additional benefits, while the lower number of replicas for the other data items hurts the latency performance of these global policies.",

                "However, as N increases, the sparseness assumption for which the analysis is valid, namely N << G, is no longer true.",
                "Hence, the two curves rapidly diverge.",
                "The point at which the two curves move away from each other corresponds to a value of δagg ≤ 1.",
                "Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the analysis provides an upper bound on the latency improvements, as it treats the newly created replicas given by Nc i independently.",
                "However, these Nc i replicas start from the same cell as one of the server replicas ri.",
                "Finally, the analysis captures a oneshot scenario where given an initial data item replica distribution, the availability latency is computed.",
                "The new replicas created do not affect future requests from the client.",
                "On account of space limitations, here, we summarize the observations in the case when z-relay zebroids are employed.",
                "The interested reader can obtain further details in [9].",
                "Similar observations, like the one-instantaneous zebroid case, apply since the simulation and analysis curves again start diverging when the analysis assumptions are no longer valid.",

                "This is because one-instantaneous zebroids are a special case of z-relay zebroids. 6.2.2 Simulation We conduct simulations to examine the entire storage spectrum obtained by changing car density N or storage per car α to also capture scenarios where the sparseness assumptions for which the analysis is valid do not hold.",

                "With Figure 3.b, keeping α constant, initially increasing car density has higher latency benefits because increasing N introduces more zebroids in the system.",
                "As N is further increased, ω reduces because the total storage in the system goes up.",
                "Consequently, the number of replicas per data item goes up thereby increasing the 79 number of servers.",

                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
                "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",

                "The aggregated expected <br>availability latency</br> in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).",
                "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
                "This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected <br>availability latency</br> with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",

                "Hence, it determines the optimal set of forwarding decisions 76 that will enable the data item to be delivered to the client in the minimum amount of time.",
                "Note that the latency along the quickest delivery path that employs a relay team of z zebroids is similar to that obtained with epidemic routing [19] under the assumptions of infinite storage and no interference.",
                "A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the clients request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity.",
                "Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid.",
                "In some cases, the dispatcher might have inaccurate information about the routes of the cars.",

                "To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids.",
                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
                "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",
                "With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane.",
                "Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner.",

                "This scheme computes the number of data item replicas as a function of their popularity.",
                "It is static because number of replicas in the system do not change and no replacements are performed.",
                "Hence, this is referred to as the nozebroids environment.",
                "We quantify the performance of the various replacement policies with reference to this base-line that does not employ zebroids.",

                "Eventually, majority of the storage capacity of a car will be exhausted. 3.2 Carrier-based Replacement policies The replacement policies considered in this paper are reactive since a replacement occurs only in response to a request issued for a certain data item.",
                "When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item.",
                "For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.",
                "This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18].",
                "The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random).",
                "We have considered local and global variants of the LRU/LFU policies which determine whether local or global knowledge of contents of the cars known at the dispatcher is used for the eviction decision at a zebroid (see [9] for more details).",
                "The replacement policies incur the following overheads.",
                "First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy.",
                "Second, the bandwidth used to transfer a copy of a data item from a server to the zebroid.",
                "Third, the average number of replacements incurred by the zebroids.",
                "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
                "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids.",
                "First, we present some preliminaries of our analysis methodology. • Let N be the number of cars in the network performing a 2D random walk on a √ G× √ G torus.",
                "An additional car serves as a client yielding a total of N + 1 cars.",
                "Such a mobility model has been used widely in the literature [17, 16] chiefly because it is amenable to analysis and provides a baseline against which performance of other mobility models can be compared.",
                "Moreover, this class of Markovian mobility models has been used to model the movements of vehicles [3, 21]. • We assume that all cars start from the stationary distribution and perform independent random walks.",
                "Although for sparse density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it is no longer valid when N approaches G. • Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also, data item i has ri replicas.",
                "This implies ri cars, identified as servers, have a copy of this data item when the client requests item i.",
                "All analysis results presented in this section are obtained assuming that the client is willing to wait as long as it takes for its request to be satisfied (unbounded trip duration γ = ∞).",
                "With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2].",
                "Extensions to the analysis that also consider finite trip durations can be obtained in [9].",
                "Consider a scenario where no zebroids are employed.",
                "In this case, the expected availability latency for the data item is the expected meeting time of the random walk undertaken by the client with any of the random walks performed by the servers.",

                "The meeting time, or equivalently the availability latency δi, for the client requesting data item i is the time till it encounters any of these ri replicas for the first time.",
                "This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value (note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G >> ri): δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items, weighted by their frequency of access: δagg(no − zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri = T i=1 fi · C ri (2) 77 4.1 One-instantaneous zebroids Recall that with one-instantaneous zebroids, for a given request, a new replica is created on a car in the vicinity of the server, provided this car meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.",
                "Moreover, this replica is spawned at the time step when the client issues the request.",

                "The availability latency is reduced since the client is more likely to meet a replica earlier.",
                "The aggregated expected availability latency in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).",
                "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
                "This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",

                "This is because of several reasons.",
                "Recall that the initial replica distribution is set as per the squareroot replication scheme.",
                "The random replacement scheme does not alter this distribution since it makes replacements blind to the popularity of a data item.",

                "Moreover, the mobility pattern of the cars is random, hence, the locations from which the requests are issued by clients are also random and not known a priori at the dispatcher.",
                "These findings are significant because a random replacement policy can be implemented in a simple decentralized manner.",
                "The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.",
                "This is because these policies rapidly develop a preference for the more popular data items thereby creating a larger number of replicas for them.",

                "Consequently, there are fewer replicas for the less popular items.",

                "The higher number of replicas for the popular data items provide marginal additional benefits, while the lower number of replicas for the other data items hurts the latency performance of these global policies.",

                "However, as N increases, the sparseness assumption for which the analysis is valid, namely N << G, is no longer true.",
                "Hence, the two curves rapidly diverge.",
                "The point at which the two curves move away from each other corresponds to a value of δagg ≤ 1.",
                "Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the analysis provides an upper bound on the latency improvements, as it treats the newly created replicas given by Nc i independently.",
                "However, these Nc i replicas start from the same cell as one of the server replicas ri.",
                "Finally, the analysis captures a oneshot scenario where given an initial data item replica distribution, the availability latency is computed.",
                "The new replicas created do not affect future requests from the client.",
                "On account of space limitations, here, we summarize the observations in the case when z-relay zebroids are employed.",

                "Hence, it determines the optimal set of forwarding decisions 76 that will enable the data item to be delivered to the client in the minimum amount of time.",
                "Note that the latency along the quickest delivery path that employs a relay team of z zebroids is similar to that obtained with epidemic routing [19] under the assumptions of infinite storage and no interference.",
                "A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the clients request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity.",
                "Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid.",
                "In some cases, the dispatcher might have inaccurate information about the routes of the cars.",
                "Hence, a zebroid scheduled on the basis of this inaccurate information may not rendezvous with its target client.",
                "To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids.",
                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
                "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",
                "With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane.",
                "Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner.",
                "This remains a future research direction.",
                "Initially, number of replicas for each data item replicas might be computed using Equation 1.",
                "This scheme computes the number of data item replicas as a function of their popularity.",
                "It is static because number of replicas in the system do not change and no replacements are performed.",

                "Eventually, majority of the storage capacity of a car will be exhausted. 3.2 Carrier-based Replacement policies The replacement policies considered in this paper are reactive since a replacement occurs only in response to a request issued for a certain data item.",
                "When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item.",
                "For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.",
                "This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18].",
                "The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random).",
                "We have considered local and global variants of the LRU/LFU policies which determine whether local or global knowledge of contents of the cars known at the dispatcher is used for the eviction decision at a zebroid (see [9] for more details).",

                "First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy.",
                "Second, the bandwidth used to transfer a copy of a data item from a server to the zebroid.",
                "Third, the average number of replacements incurred by the zebroids.",
                "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
                "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids.",

                "Such a mobility model has been used widely in the literature [17, 16] chiefly because it is amenable to analysis and provides a baseline against which performance of other mobility models can be compared.",
                "Moreover, this class of Markovian mobility models has been used to model the movements of vehicles [3, 21]. • We assume that all cars start from the stationary distribution and perform independent random walks.",
                "Although for sparse density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it is no longer valid when N approaches G. • Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also, data item i has ri replicas.",
                "This implies ri cars, identified as servers, have a copy of this data item when the client requests item i.",
                "All analysis results presented in this section are obtained assuming that the client is willing to wait as long as it takes for its request to be satisfied (unbounded trip duration γ = ∞).",
                "With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2].",
                "Extensions to the analysis that also consider finite trip durations can be obtained in [9].",
                "Consider a scenario where no zebroids are employed.",
                "In this case, the expected availability latency for the data item is the expected meeting time of the random walk undertaken by the client with any of the random walks performed by the servers.",
                "Aldous et al. [2] show that the the meeting time of two random walks in such a setting can be modelled as an exponential distribution with the mean C = c · G · log G, where the constant c 0.17 for G ≥ 25.",
                "The meeting time, or equivalently the availability latency δi, for the client requesting data item i is the time till it encounters any of these ri replicas for the first time.",
                "This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value (note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G >> ri): δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items, weighted by their frequency of access: δagg(no − zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri = T i=1 fi · C ri (2) 77 4.1 One-instantaneous zebroids Recall that with one-instantaneous zebroids, for a given request, a new replica is created on a car in the vicinity of the server, provided this car meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.",
                "Moreover, this replica is spawned at the time step when the client issues the request.",
                "Let Nc i be the expected total number of nodes that are in the same cell as any of the ri servers.",
                "Then, we have Nc i = (N − ri) · (1 − (1 − 1 G )ri ) (3) In the analytical model, we assume that Nc i new replicas are created, so that the total number of replicas is increased to ri +Nc i .",
                "The availability latency is reduced since the client is more likely to meet a replica earlier.",
                "The aggregated expected availability latency in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).",
                "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
                "This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",
                "Details of the procedure to obtain a closed-form expression are given in [9].",
                "The aggregate availability latency (δagg) with z-relay zebroids is given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 [fi · C N + 1 · 1 N + 1 − ri · (N · log N ri − log (N + 1 − ri))] (5) 5.",
                "SIMULATION METHODOLOGY The simulation environment considered in this study comprises of vehicles such as cars that carry a fraction of the data item repository.",
                "A prediction accuracy parameter inherently provides a certain probabilistic guarantee on the confidence of the car route predictions known at the dispatcher.",
                "A value of 100% implies that the exact routes of all cars are known at all times.",
                "A 70% value for this parameter indicates that the routes predicted for the cars will match the actual ones with probability 0.7.",

                "In each time slot, every car makes a transition from a cell to any of its neighboring 8 cells.",
                "The transition is a function of the current location of the car and a probability transition matrix Q = [qij] where qij is the probability of transition from state i to state j.",

                "This is because additional replicas occupy storage without providing benefits. • Either one-instantaneous or z-relay zebroids may be employed per client request for latency improvement. • Unless otherwise mentioned, the prediction accuracy parameter is assumed to be 100%.",
                "This is because this study aims to quantify the effect of a large number of parameters individually on availability latency.",
                "Here, we set the size of every data item, Si, to be 1. α represents the number of storage slots per AutoMata.",
                "Each storage slot stores one data item. γ represents the duration of the clients journey in terms of the number of time slots.",
                "Hence the possible values of availability latency are between 0 and γ. δ is defined as the number of time slots after which a client AutoMata device will encounter a replica of the data item for the first time.",

                "Recall that the initial replica distribution is set as per the squareroot replication scheme.",
                "The random replacement scheme does not alter this distribution since it makes replacements blind to the popularity of a data item.",

                "The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.",

                "A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the clients request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity.",

                "To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids.",
                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
                "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",
                "With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane.",
                "Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner.",

                "First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy.",
                "Second, the bandwidth used to transfer a copy of a data item from a server to the zebroid.",

                "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
                "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids.",

                "Although for sparse density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it is no longer valid when N approaches G. • Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also, data item i has ri replicas.",
                "This implies ri cars, identified as servers, have a copy of this data item when the client requests item i.",
                "All analysis results presented in this section are obtained assuming that the client is willing to wait as long as it takes for its request to be satisfied (unbounded trip duration γ = ∞).",
                "With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2].",

                "Consider a scenario where no zebroids are employed.",
                "In this case, the expected availability latency for the data item is the expected meeting time of the random walk undertaken by the client with any of the random walks performed by the servers.",

                "The meeting time, or equivalently the availability latency δi, for the client requesting data item i is the time till it encounters any of these ri replicas for the first time.",
                "This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value (note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G >> ri): δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items, weighted by their frequency of access: δagg(no − zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri = T i=1 fi · C ri (2) 77 4.1 One-instantaneous zebroids Recall that with one-instantaneous zebroids, for a given request, a new replica is created on a car in the vicinity of the server, provided this car meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.",
                "Moreover, this replica is spawned at the time step when the client issues the request.",
                "Let Nc i be the expected total number of nodes that are in the same cell as any of the ri servers.",
                "Then, we have Nc i = (N − ri) · (1 − (1 − 1 G )ri ) (3) In the analytical model, we assume that Nc i new replicas are created, so that the total number of replicas is increased to ri +Nc i .",
                "The availability latency is reduced since the client is more likely to meet a replica earlier.",
                "The aggregated expected availability latency in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).",
                "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
                "This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",

                "These findings are significant because a random replacement policy can be implemented in a simple decentralized manner.",
                "The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.",

                "Consequently, there are fewer replicas for the less popular items.",

                "The higher number of replicas for the popular data items provide marginal additional benefits, while the lower number of replicas for the other data items hurts the latency performance of these global policies.",

                "Hence, the two curves rapidly diverge.",
                "The point at which the two curves move away from each other corresponds to a value of δagg ≤ 1.",
                "Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the analysis provides an upper bound on the latency improvements, as it treats the newly created replicas given by Nc i independently.",

                "In cases where a data item may be lost from the ad-hoc network, this equation becomes ri = min (N, max (0, Ri·N·α Si )).",
                "In this case, a request for the lost data item may need to be satisfied by fetching the item from a remote server.",
                "The availability latency for a data item i, denoted as δi, is defined as the earliest time at which a client AutoMata will find the first replica of the item accessible to it.",
                "If this condition is not satisfied, then we set δi to γ.",
                "This indicates that data item i was not available to the client during its journey.",
                "Note that since there is at least one replica in the system for every data item i, by setting γ to a large value we ensure that the clients request for any data item i will be satisfied.",

                "We are interested in the availability latency observed across all data items.",
                "Hence, we augment the average availability latency for every data item i with its fi to obtain the following weighted availability latency (δagg) metric: δagg = T i=1 δi · fi Next, we present our solution approach describing how zebroids are selected. 3.",
                "SOLUTION APPROACH 3.1 Zebroids When a client references a data item missing from its local storage, the dispatcher identifies all cars with a copy of the data item as servers.",
                "Next, the dispatcher obtains the future routes of all cars for a finite time duration equivalent to the maximum time the client is willing to wait for its request to be serviced.",
                "Using this information, the dispatcher schedules the quickest delivery path from any of the servers to the client using any other cars as intermediate carriers.",
                "Hence, it determines the optimal set of forwarding decisions 76 that will enable the data item to be delivered to the client in the minimum amount of time.",
                "Note that the latency along the quickest delivery path that employs a relay team of z zebroids is similar to that obtained with epidemic routing [19] under the assumptions of infinite storage and no interference.",
                "A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the clients request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity.",
                "Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid.",
                "In some cases, the dispatcher might have inaccurate information about the routes of the cars.",
                "Hence, a zebroid scheduled on the basis of this inaccurate information may not rendezvous with its target client.",
                "To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids.",
                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
                "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",
                "With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane.",
                "Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner.",
                "This remains a future research direction.",
                "Initially, number of replicas for each data item replicas might be computed using Equation 1.",
                "This scheme computes the number of data item replicas as a function of their popularity.",
                "It is static because number of replicas in the system do not change and no replacements are performed.",
                "Hence, this is referred to as the nozebroids environment.",
                "We quantify the performance of the various replacement policies with reference to this base-line that does not employ zebroids.",
                "One may assume a cold start phase, where initially only one or few copies of every data item exist in the system.",
                "Many storage slots of the cars may be unoccupied.",
                "When the cars encounter one another they construct new replicas of some selected data items to occupy the empty slots.",
                "The selection procedure may be to choose the data items uniformly at random.",
                "New replicas are created as long as a car has a certain threshold of its storage unoccupied.",
                "Eventually, majority of the storage capacity of a car will be exhausted. 3.2 Carrier-based Replacement policies The replacement policies considered in this paper are reactive since a replacement occurs only in response to a request issued for a certain data item.",
                "When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item.",
                "For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.",
                "This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18].",
                "The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random).",
                "We have considered local and global variants of the LRU/LFU policies which determine whether local or global knowledge of contents of the cars known at the dispatcher is used for the eviction decision at a zebroid (see [9] for more details).",
                "The replacement policies incur the following overheads.",
                "First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy.",
                "Second, the bandwidth used to transfer a copy of a data item from a server to the zebroid.",
                "Third, the average number of replacements incurred by the zebroids.",
                "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
                "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids.",
                "First, we present some preliminaries of our analysis methodology. • Let N be the number of cars in the network performing a 2D random walk on a √ G× √ G torus.",
                "An additional car serves as a client yielding a total of N + 1 cars.",
                "Such a mobility model has been used widely in the literature [17, 16] chiefly because it is amenable to analysis and provides a baseline against which performance of other mobility models can be compared.",
                "Moreover, this class of Markovian mobility models has been used to model the movements of vehicles [3, 21]. • We assume that all cars start from the stationary distribution and perform independent random walks.",
                "Although for sparse density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it is no longer valid when N approaches G. • Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also, data item i has ri replicas.",
                "This implies ri cars, identified as servers, have a copy of this data item when the client requests item i.",
                "All analysis results presented in this section are obtained assuming that the client is willing to wait as long as it takes for its request to be satisfied (unbounded trip duration γ = ∞).",
                "With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2].",
                "Extensions to the analysis that also consider finite trip durations can be obtained in [9].",
                "Consider a scenario where no zebroids are employed.",
                "In this case, the expected availability latency for the data item is the expected meeting time of the random walk undertaken by the client with any of the random walks performed by the servers.",
                "Aldous et al. [2] show that the the meeting time of two random walks in such a setting can be modelled as an exponential distribution with the mean C = c · G · log G, where the constant c 0.17 for G ≥ 25.",
                "The meeting time, or equivalently the availability latency δi, for the client requesting data item i is the time till it encounters any of these ri replicas for the first time.",
                "This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value (note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G >> ri): δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items, weighted by their frequency of access: δagg(no − zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri = T i=1 fi · C ri (2) 77 4.1 One-instantaneous zebroids Recall that with one-instantaneous zebroids, for a given request, a new replica is created on a car in the vicinity of the server, provided this car meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.",
                "Moreover, this replica is spawned at the time step when the client issues the request.",
                "Let Nc i be the expected total number of nodes that are in the same cell as any of the ri servers.",

                "Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid.",
                "In some cases, the dispatcher might have inaccurate information about the routes of the cars.",
                "Hence, a zebroid scheduled on the basis of this inaccurate information may not rendezvous with its target client.",
                "To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids.",
                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
                "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",
                "With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane.",
                "Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner.",

                "For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.",
                "This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18].",
                "The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random).",
                "We have considered local and global variants of the LRU/LFU policies which determine whether local or global knowledge of contents of the cars known at the dispatcher is used for the eviction decision at a zebroid (see [9] for more details).",

                "First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy.",

                "Third, the average number of replacements incurred by the zebroids.",
                "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
                "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",

                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",

                "Recall that the initial replica distribution is set as per the squareroot replication scheme.",
                "The random replacement scheme does not alter this distribution since it makes replacements blind to the popularity of a data item.",

                "The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.",

                "The higher number of replicas for the popular data items provide marginal additional benefits, while the lower number of replicas for the other data items hurts the latency performance of these global policies.",

                "The point at which the two curves move away from each other corresponds to a value of δagg ≤ 1.",
                "Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the analysis provides an upper bound on the latency improvements, as it treats the newly created replicas given by Nc i independently.",
                "However, these Nc i replicas start from the same cell as one of the server replicas ri.",
                "Finally, the analysis captures a oneshot scenario where given an initial data item replica distribution, the availability latency is computed.",

                "This indicates that data item i was not available to the client during its journey.",

                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a <br>zebroid</br>. 4.",

                "The aggregated expected availability latency in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).",
                "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single <br>zebroid</br>, if it determines that the <br>zebroid</br> will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
                "This selected <br>zebroid</br> is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",

                "Recall that the initial replica distribution is set as per the squareroot replication scheme.",

                "These findings are significant because a random replacement policy can be implemented in a simple decentralized manner.",
                "The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.",

                "Hence, the two curves rapidly diverge.",
                "The point at which the two curves move away from each other corresponds to a value of δagg ≤ 1.",
                "Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the analysis provides an upper bound on the latency improvements, as it treats the newly created replicas given by Nc i independently.",
                "However, these Nc i replicas start from the same cell as one of the server replicas ri.",
                "Finally, the analysis captures a oneshot scenario where given an initial data item replica distribution, the availability latency is computed.",

                "This is because in sparse scenarios, the transitive hand-offs between the zebroids creates higher number of replicas for the requested data item, yielding lower availability latency.",
                "Moreover, it is also seen that the simulation validation curve for the improvements in δagg with z-relay zebroids approaches that of the one-instantaneous <br>zebroid</br> case for higher storage (higher N values).",
                "This is because one-instantaneous zebroids are a special case of z-relay zebroids. 6.2.2 Simulation We conduct simulations to examine the entire storage spectrum obtained by changing car density N or storage per car α to also capture scenarios where the sparseness assumptions for which the analysis is valid do not hold.",

                "Note that the latency along the quickest delivery path that employs a relay team of z zebroids is similar to that obtained with epidemic routing [19] under the assumptions of infinite storage and no interference.",
                "A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the clients request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity.",
                "Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid.",
                "In some cases, the dispatcher might have inaccurate information about the routes of the cars.",
                "Hence, a zebroid scheduled on the basis of this inaccurate information may not rendezvous with its target client.",
                "To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids.",
                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
                "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",
                "With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane.",
                "Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner.",

                "When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item.",
                "For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.",
                "This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18].",
                "The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random).",

                "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
                "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids.",

                "Although for sparse density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it is no longer valid when N approaches G. • Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also, data item i has ri replicas.",
                "This implies ri cars, identified as servers, have a copy of this data item when the client requests item i.",
                "All analysis results presented in this section are obtained assuming that the client is willing to wait as long as it takes for its request to be satisfied (unbounded trip duration γ = ∞).",
                "With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2].",

                "The meeting time, or equivalently the availability latency δi, for the client requesting data item i is the time till it encounters any of these ri replicas for the first time.",
                "This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value (note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G >> ri): δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items, weighted by their frequency of access: δagg(no − zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri = T i=1 fi · C ri (2) 77 4.1 One-instantaneous zebroids Recall that with one-instantaneous zebroids, for a given request, a new replica is created on a car in the vicinity of the server, provided this car meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.",

                "The availability latency is reduced since the client is more likely to meet a replica earlier.",
                "The aggregated expected availability latency in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).",
                "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
                "This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",

                "What is the associated overhead incurred in employing these zebroids?",
                "What happens to these improvements in scenarios where a dispatcher may have imperfect information about the car routes?",
                "What inherent trade-offs exist between car density and storage per car with regards to their combined as well as individual effect on availability latency in the presence of zebroids?",
                "We present both simple analysis and detailed simulations to provide answers to these questions as well as gain insights into design of carrier-based systems. 6.1 How does a replacement scheme employed by a zebroid impact availability latency?",
                "For illustration, we present scale-up experiments where oneinstantaneous zebroids are employed (see Figure 1).",
                "By scale-up, we mean that α and N are changed proportionally to keep the total system storage, ST , constant.",
                "Here, T = 50 and ST = 200.",
                "We choose the following values of (N,α) = {(20,10), (25,8), (50,4), (100,2)}.",
                "The figure indicates that a random replacement scheme shows competitive performance.",
                "This is because of several reasons.",
                "Recall that the initial replica distribution is set as per the squareroot replication scheme.",
                "The random replacement scheme does not alter this distribution since it makes replacements blind to the popularity of a data item.",
                "However, the replacements cause dynamic data re-organization so as to better serve the currently active request.",
                "Moreover, the mobility pattern of the cars is random, hence, the locations from which the requests are issued by clients are also random and not known a priori at the dispatcher.",
                "These findings are significant because a random replacement policy can be implemented in a simple decentralized manner.",
                "The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.",
                "This is because these policies rapidly develop a preference for the more popular data items thereby creating a larger number of replicas for them.",
                "During eviction, the more popular data items are almost never selected as a replacement candidate.",
                "Consequently, there are fewer replicas for the less popular items.",
                "Hence, the initial distribution of the data item replicas changes from square-root to that resembling linear replication.",
                "The higher number of replicas for the popular data items provide marginal additional benefits, while the lower number of replicas for the other data items hurts the latency performance of these global policies.",
                "The lfu-local and lru-local schemes have similar performance to random since they do not have enough history of local data item requests.",
                "We speculate that the performance of these local policies will approach that of their global variants for a large enough history of data item requests.",
                "On account of the competitive performance shown by a random policy, for the remainder of the paper, we present the performance of zebroids that employ a random replacement policy. 6.2 Do zebroids provide significant improvements in availability latency?",
                "We find that in many scenarios employing zebroids provides substantial improvements in availability latency. 6.2.1 Analysis We first consider the case of one-instantaneous zebroids.",
                "Figure 2.a shows the variation in δagg as a function of N for T = 10 and α = 1 with a 10 × 10 torus using Equation 4.",
                "Both the x and y axes are drawn to a log-scale.",
                "Figure 2.b show the % improvement in δagg obtained with one-instantaneous zebroids.",
                "In this case, only the x-axis is drawn to a log-scale.",
                "For illustration, we assume that the T data items are requested uniformly.",
                "Initially, when the network is sparse the analytical approximation for improvements in latency with zebroids, obtained from Equations 2 and 4, closely matches the simulation results.",
                "However, as N increases, the sparseness assumption for which the analysis is valid, namely N << G, is no longer true.",
                "Hence, the two curves rapidly diverge.",
                "The point at which the two curves move away from each other corresponds to a value of δagg ≤ 1.",
                "Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the analysis provides an upper bound on the latency improvements, as it treats the newly created replicas given by Nc i independently.",
                "However, these Nc i replicas start from the same cell as one of the server replicas ri.",
                "Finally, the analysis captures a oneshot scenario where given an initial data item replica distribution, the availability latency is computed.",
                "The new replicas created do not affect future requests from the client.",
                "On account of space limitations, here, we summarize the observations in the case when z-relay zebroids are employed.",
                "The interested reader can obtain further details in [9].",
                "Similar observations, like the one-instantaneous zebroid case, apply since the simulation and analysis curves again start diverging when the analysis assumptions are no longer valid.",
                "However, the key observation here is that the latency improvement with z-relay zebroids is significantly better than the one-instantaneous zebroids case, especially for lower storage scenarios.",
                "This is because in sparse scenarios, the transitive hand-offs between the zebroids creates higher number of replicas for the requested data item, yielding lower availability latency.",
                "Moreover, it is also seen that the simulation validation curve for the improvements in δagg with z-relay zebroids approaches that of the one-instantaneous zebroid case for higher storage (higher N values).",
                "This is because one-instantaneous zebroids are a special case of z-relay zebroids. 6.2.2 Simulation We conduct simulations to examine the entire storage spectrum obtained by changing car density N or storage per car α to also capture scenarios where the sparseness assumptions for which the analysis is valid do not hold.",
                "We separate the effect of N and α by capturing the variation of N while keeping α constant (case 1) and vice-versa (case 2) both with z-relay and one-instantaneous zebroids.",
                "Here, we set the repository size as T = 25.",
                "Figure 3 captures case 1 mentioned above.",
                "Similar trends are observed with case 2, a complete description of those results are available in [9].",
                "With Figure 3.b, keeping α constant, initially increasing car density has higher latency benefits because increasing N introduces more zebroids in the system.",
                "As N is further increased, ω reduces because the total storage in the system goes up.",
                "Consequently, the number of replicas per data item goes up thereby increasing the 79 number of servers.",
                "Hence, the replacement policy cannot find a zebroid as often to transport the requested data item to the client earlier than any of the servers.",
                "On the other hand, the increased number of servers benefits the no-zebroids case in bringing δagg down.",
                "The net effect results in reduction in ω for larger values of N. 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 Number of cars no−zebroidsanal no−zebroids sim one−instantaneous anal one−instantaneoussim Aggregate Availability latency (δagg ) 2.a) δagg 10 1 10 2 10 3 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Number of cars % Improvement in δagg wrt no−zebroids (ω) analytical upper−bound simulation 2.b) ω Figure 2: Figure 2 shows the latency performance with oneinstantaneous zebroids via simulations along with the analytical approximation for a 10 × 10 torus with T = 10.",
                "The trends mentioned above are similar to that obtained from the analysis.",
                "However, somewhat counter-intuitively with relatively higher system storage, z-relay zebroids provide slightly lower improvements in latency as compared to one-instantaneous zebroids.",
                "We speculate that this is due to the different data item replica distributions enforced by them.",
                "Note that replacements performed by the zebroids cause fluctuations in these replica distributions which may effect future client requests.",
                "We are currently exploring suitable choices of parameters that can capture these changing replica distributions. 6.3 What is the overhead incurred with improvements in latency with zebroids?",
                "We find that the improvements in latency with zebroids are obtained at a minimal replacement overhead (< 1 per client request). 6.3.1 Analysis With one-instantaneous zebroids, for each client request a maximum of one zebroid is employed for latency improvement.",
                "Hence, the replacement overhead per client request can amount to a maximum of one.",

                "Now a replacement is only incurred if one of these Nc i newly created replicas meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.",
                "Let Xri and XNc i respectively be random variables that capture the minimum time till any of the ri and Nc i replicas meet the client.",
                "Since Xri and XNc i are assumed to be independent, by the property of exponentially distributed random variables we have, Overhead/request = 1 · P(XNc i < Xri ) + 0 · P(Xri ≤ XNc i ) (6) Overhead/request = ri C ri C + Nc i C = ri ri + Nc i (7) Recall that the number of replicas for data item i, ri, is a function of the total storage in the system i.e., ri = k·N ·α where k satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ ri ≤ N. Using this along with Equation 2, we get Overhead/request = 1 − G G + N · (1 − k · α) (8) Now if we keep the total system storage N · α constant since G and T are also constant, increasing N increases the replacement overhead.",

                "This implies that a higher replacement overhead is incurred for higher N and lower α values.",
                "Moreover, when ri = N, this means that every car has a replica of data item i.",
                "Hence, no zebroids are employed when this item is requested, yielding an overhead/request for this item as zero.",
                "Next, we present simulation results that validate our analysis hypothesis for the overhead associated with deployment of one-instantaneous zebroids. 6.3.2 Simulation Figure 4 shows the replacement overhead with one-instantaneous zebroids when (N,α) are varied while keeping the total system storage constant.",
                "The trends shown by the simulation are in agreement with those predicted by the analysis above.",
                "However, the total system storage can be changed either by varying car density (N) or storage per car (α).",
                "On account of similar trends, here we present the case when α is kept constant and N is varied (Figure 5).",
                "We refer the reader to [9] for the case when α is varied and N is held constant.",
                "We present an intuitive argument for the behavior of the perrequest replacement overhead curves.",
                "When the storage is extremely scarce so that only one replica per data item exists in the AutoMata network, the number of replacements performed by the zebroids is zero since any replacement will cause a data item to be lost from the system.",
                "The dispatcher ensures that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "At the other end of the spectrum, if storage becomes so abundant that α = T then the entire data item repository can be replicated on every car.",
                "The number of replacements is again zero since each request can be satisfied locally.",
                "A similar scenario occurs if N is increased to such a large value that another car with the requested data item is always available in the vicinity of the client.",
                "However, there is a storage spectrum in the middle where replacements by the scheduled zebroids result in improvements in δagg (see Figure 3).",
                "Moreover, we observe that for sparse storage scenarios, the higher improvements with z-relay zebroids are obtained at the cost of a higher replacement overhead when compared to the one-instantaneous zebroids case.",

                "We find that zebroids continue to provide improvements in availability latency even with lower accuracy in the car route predictions.",
                "We use a single parameter p to quantify the accuracy of the car route predictions. 6.4.1 Analysis Since p represents the probability that a car route predicted by the dispatcher matches the actual one, hence, the latency with zebroids can be approximated by, δerr agg = p · δagg(zeb) + (1 − p) · δagg(no − zeb) (9) δerr agg = p · δagg(zeb) + (1 − p) · C ri (10) Expressions for δagg(zeb) can be obtained from Equations 4 (one-instantaneous) or 5 (z-relay zebroids). 6.4.2 Simulation Figure 6 shows the variation in δagg as a function of this route prediction accuracy metric.",
                "We observe a smooth reduction in the 81 improvement in δagg as the prediction accuracy metric reduces.",
                "For zebroids that are scheduled but fail to rendezvous with the client due to the prediction error, we tag any such replacements made by the zebroids as failed.",
                "It is seen that failed replacements gradually increase as the prediction accuracy reduces. 6.5 Under what conditions are the improvements in availability latency with zebroids maximized?",
                "Surprisingly, we find that the improvements in latency obtained with one-instantaneous zebroids are independent of the input distribution of the popularity of the data items. 6.5.1 Analysis The fractional difference (labelled ω) in the latency between the no-zebroids and one-instantaneous zebroids is obtained from equations 2, 3, and 4 as ω = T i=1 fi·C ri − T i=1 fi·C ri+(N−ri)·(1−(1− 1 G )ri ) T i=1 fi·C ri (11) Here C = c·G·log G. This captures the fractional improvement in the availability latency obtained by employing one-instantaneous zebroids.",
                "Let α = 1, making the total storage in the system ST = N. Assuming the initial replica distribution is as per the squareroot replication scheme, we have, ri = √ fi·N T j=1 √ fj .",
                "Hence, we get fi = K2 ·r2 i N2 , where K = T j=1 fj.",
                "Using this, along with the approximation (1 − x)n 1 − n · x for small x, we simplify the above equation to get, ω = 1 − T i=1 ri 1+ N−ri G T i=1 ri In order to determine when the gains with one-instantaneous zebroids are maximized, we can frame an optimization problem as follows: Maximize ω, subject to T i=1 ri = ST THEOREM 1.",
                "With a square-root replication scheme, improvements obtained with one-instantaneous zebroids are independent of the input popularity distribution of the data items. (See [9] for proof) 6.5.2 Simulation We perform simulations with two different frequency distribution of data items: Uniform and Zipfian (with mean= 0.27).",
                "Similar latency improvements with one-instantaneous zebroids are obtained in both cases.",
                "This result has important implications.",
                "In cases with biased popularity toward certain data items, the aggregate improvements in latency across all data item requests still remain the same.",
                "Even in scenarios where the frequency of access to the data items changes dynamically, zebroids will continue to provide similar latency improvements. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS In this study, we examined the improvements in latency that can be obtained in the presence of carriers that deliver a data item from a server to a client.",

                "The availability latency for a data item i, denoted as δi, is defined as the earliest time at which a client AutoMata will find the first replica of the item accessible to it.",
                "If this condition is not satisfied, then we set δi to γ.",

                "SOLUTION APPROACH 3.1 Zebroids When a client references a data item missing from its local storage, the dispatcher identifies all cars with a copy of the data item as servers.",
                "Next, the dispatcher obtains the future routes of all cars for a finite time duration equivalent to the maximum time the client is willing to wait for its request to be serviced.",
                "Using this information, the dispatcher schedules the quickest delivery path from any of the servers to the client using any other cars as intermediate carriers.",
                "Hence, it determines the optimal set of forwarding decisions 76 that will enable the data item to be delivered to the client in the minimum amount of time.",
                "Note that the latency along the quickest delivery path that employs a relay team of z zebroids is similar to that obtained with epidemic routing [19] under the assumptions of infinite storage and no interference.",
                "A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the clients request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity.",
                "Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid.",
                "In some cases, the dispatcher might have inaccurate information about the routes of the cars.",
                "Hence, a zebroid scheduled on the basis of this inaccurate information may not rendezvous with its target client.",
                "To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids.",
                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
                "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",
                "With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane.",
                "Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner.",
                "This remains a future research direction.",
                "Initially, number of replicas for each data item replicas might be computed using Equation 1.",
                "This scheme computes the number of data item replicas as a function of their popularity.",
                "It is static because number of replicas in the system do not change and no replacements are performed.",

                "One may assume a cold start phase, where initially only one or few copies of every data item exist in the system.",
                "Many storage slots of the cars may be unoccupied.",
                "When the cars encounter one another they construct new replicas of some selected data items to occupy the empty slots.",
                "The selection procedure may be to choose the data items uniformly at random.",
                "New replicas are created as long as a car has a certain threshold of its storage unoccupied.",
                "Eventually, majority of the storage capacity of a car will be exhausted. 3.2 Carrier-based Replacement policies The replacement policies considered in this paper are reactive since a replacement occurs only in response to a request issued for a certain data item.",
                "When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item.",
                "For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.",
                "This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18].",
                "The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random).",
                "We have considered local and global variants of the LRU/LFU policies which determine whether local or global knowledge of contents of the cars known at the dispatcher is used for the eviction decision at a zebroid (see [9] for more details).",
                "The replacement policies incur the following overheads.",
                "First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy.",
                "Second, the bandwidth used to transfer a copy of a data item from a server to the zebroid.",
                "Third, the average number of replacements incurred by the zebroids.",
                "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
                "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids.",
                "First, we present some preliminaries of our analysis methodology. • Let N be the number of cars in the network performing a 2D random walk on a √ G× √ G torus.",
                "An additional car serves as a client yielding a total of N + 1 cars.",
                "Such a mobility model has been used widely in the literature [17, 16] chiefly because it is amenable to analysis and provides a baseline against which performance of other mobility models can be compared.",
                "Moreover, this class of Markovian mobility models has been used to model the movements of vehicles [3, 21]. • We assume that all cars start from the stationary distribution and perform independent random walks.",
                "Although for sparse density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it is no longer valid when N approaches G. • Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also, data item i has ri replicas.",
                "This implies ri cars, identified as servers, have a copy of this data item when the client requests item i.",
                "All analysis results presented in this section are obtained assuming that the client is willing to wait as long as it takes for its request to be satisfied (unbounded trip duration γ = ∞).",
                "With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2].",
                "Extensions to the analysis that also consider finite trip durations can be obtained in [9].",
                "Consider a scenario where no zebroids are employed.",
                "In this case, the expected availability latency for the data item is the expected meeting time of the random walk undertaken by the client with any of the random walks performed by the servers.",
                "Aldous et al. [2] show that the the meeting time of two random walks in such a setting can be modelled as an exponential distribution with the mean C = c · G · log G, where the constant c 0.17 for G ≥ 25.",
                "The meeting time, or equivalently the availability latency δi, for the client requesting data item i is the time till it encounters any of these ri replicas for the first time.",
                "This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value (note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G >> ri): δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items, weighted by their frequency of access: δagg(no − zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri = T i=1 fi · C ri (2) 77 4.1 One-instantaneous zebroids Recall that with one-instantaneous zebroids, for a given request, a new replica is created on a car in the vicinity of the server, provided this car meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.",
                "Moreover, this replica is spawned at the time step when the client issues the request.",
                "Let Nc i be the expected total number of nodes that are in the same cell as any of the ri servers.",
                "Then, we have Nc i = (N − ri) · (1 − (1 − 1 G )ri ) (3) In the analytical model, we assume that Nc i new replicas are created, so that the total number of replicas is increased to ri +Nc i .",
                "The availability latency is reduced since the client is more likely to meet a replica earlier.",
                "The aggregated expected availability latency in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).",
                "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
                "This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",
                "Details of the procedure to obtain a closed-form expression are given in [9].",
                "The aggregate availability latency (δagg) with z-relay zebroids is given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 [fi · C N + 1 · 1 N + 1 − ri · (N · log N ri − log (N + 1 − ri))] (5) 5.",
                "SIMULATION METHODOLOGY The simulation environment considered in this study comprises of vehicles such as cars that carry a fraction of the data item repository.",

                "The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.",

                "The higher number of replicas for the popular data items provide marginal additional benefits, while the lower number of replicas for the other data items hurts the latency performance of these global policies.",

                "To exchange data, we assume each AutoMata is configured with two types of networking cards: 1) a low-bandwidth networking card with a long radio-range in the order of miles that enables an AutoMata device to communicate with a nearby cellular or WiMax station, 2) a high-bandwidth networking card with a limited radio-range in the order of hundreds of feet.",

                "Finally, storage constraints may require a zebroid to evict existing data items from its local storage to accommodate the client requested item.",
                "In this study, we quantify the following main factors that affect availability latency in the presence of zebroids: (i) data item repository size, (ii) car density, (iii) storage capacity per car, (iv) client trip duration, (v) replacement scheme employed by the zebroids, and (vi) accuracy of the car route predictions.",

                "This captures the case when at least one copy of every data item must be present in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In cases where a data item may be lost from the ad-hoc network, this equation becomes ri = min (N, max (0, Ri·N·α Si )).",
                "In this case, a request for the lost data item may need to be satisfied by fetching the item from a remote server.",
                "The availability latency for a data item i, denoted as δi, is defined as the earliest time at which a client AutoMata will find the first replica of the item accessible to it.",
                "If this condition is not satisfied, then we set δi to γ.",
                "This indicates that data item i was not available to the client during its journey.",
                "Note that since there is at least one replica in the system for every data item i, by setting γ to a large value we ensure that the clients request for any data item i will be satisfied.",

                "We are interested in the availability latency observed across all data items.",
                "Hence, we augment the average availability latency for every data item i with its fi to obtain the following weighted availability latency (δagg) metric: δagg = T i=1 δi · fi Next, we present our solution approach describing how zebroids are selected. 3.",
                "SOLUTION APPROACH 3.1 Zebroids When a client references a data item missing from its local storage, the dispatcher identifies all cars with a copy of the data item as servers.",
                "Next, the dispatcher obtains the future routes of all cars for a finite time duration equivalent to the maximum time the client is willing to wait for its request to be serviced.",
                "Using this information, the dispatcher schedules the quickest delivery path from any of the servers to the client using any other cars as intermediate carriers.",
                "Hence, it determines the optimal set of forwarding decisions 76 that will enable the data item to be delivered to the client in the minimum amount of time.",
                "Note that the latency along the quickest delivery path that employs a relay team of z zebroids is similar to that obtained with epidemic routing [19] under the assumptions of infinite storage and no interference.",
                "A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the clients request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity.",
                "Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid.",
                "In some cases, the dispatcher might have inaccurate information about the routes of the cars.",
                "Hence, a zebroid scheduled on the basis of this inaccurate information may not rendezvous with its target client.",
                "To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids.",
                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
                "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",
                "With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane.",
                "Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner.",
                "This remains a future research direction.",
                "Initially, number of replicas for each data item replicas might be computed using Equation 1.",
                "This scheme computes the number of data item replicas as a function of their popularity.",
                "It is static because number of replicas in the system do not change and no replacements are performed.",
                "Hence, this is referred to as the nozebroids environment.",
                "We quantify the performance of the various replacement policies with reference to this base-line that does not employ zebroids.",
                "One may assume a cold start phase, where initially only one or few copies of every data item exist in the system.",
                "Many storage slots of the cars may be unoccupied.",
                "When the cars encounter one another they construct new replicas of some selected data items to occupy the empty slots.",
                "The selection procedure may be to choose the data items uniformly at random.",
                "New replicas are created as long as a car has a certain threshold of its storage unoccupied.",
                "Eventually, majority of the storage capacity of a car will be exhausted. 3.2 Carrier-based Replacement policies The replacement policies considered in this paper are reactive since a replacement occurs only in response to a request issued for a certain data item.",
                "When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item.",
                "For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.",
                "This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18].",
                "The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random).",
                "We have considered local and global variants of the LRU/LFU policies which determine whether local or global knowledge of contents of the cars known at the dispatcher is used for the eviction decision at a zebroid (see [9] for more details).",
                "The replacement policies incur the following overheads.",
                "First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy.",
                "Second, the bandwidth used to transfer a copy of a data item from a server to the zebroid.",
                "Third, the average number of replacements incurred by the zebroids.",
                "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
                "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids.",
                "First, we present some preliminaries of our analysis methodology. • Let N be the number of cars in the network performing a 2D random walk on a √ G× √ G torus.",
                "An additional car serves as a client yielding a total of N + 1 cars.",
                "Such a <br>mobility</br> model has been used widely in the literature [17, 16] chiefly because it is amenable to analysis and provides a baseline against which performance of other <br>mobility</br> models can be compared.",
                "Moreover, this class of Markovian <br>mobility</br> models has been used to model the movements of vehicles [3, 21]. • We assume that all cars start from the stationary distribution and perform independent random walks.",
                "Although for sparse density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it is no longer valid when N approaches G. • Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also, data item i has ri replicas.",

                "The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.",

                "The higher number of replicas for the popular data items provide marginal additional benefits, while the lower number of replicas for the other data items hurts the latency performance of these global policies.",

                "Note that the latency along the quickest delivery path that employs a relay team of z zebroids is similar to that obtained with epidemic routing [19] under the assumptions of infinite storage and no interference.",
                "A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the clients request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity.",
                "Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid.",
                "In some cases, the dispatcher might have inaccurate information about the routes of the cars.",
                "Hence, a zebroid scheduled on the basis of this inaccurate information may not rendezvous with its target client.",
                "To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids.",
                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
                "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",
                "With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane.",
                "Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner.",
                "This remains a future research direction.",
                "Initially, number of replicas for each data item replicas might be computed using Equation 1.",
                "This scheme computes the number of data item replicas as a function of their popularity.",
                "It is static because number of replicas in the system do not change and no replacements are performed.",
                "Hence, this is referred to as the nozebroids environment.",
                "We quantify the performance of the various replacement policies with reference to this base-line that does not employ zebroids.",

                "When the cars encounter one another they construct new replicas of some selected data items to occupy the empty slots.",
                "The selection procedure may be to choose the data items uniformly at random.",
                "New replicas are created as long as a car has a certain threshold of its storage unoccupied.",
                "Eventually, majority of the storage capacity of a car will be exhausted. 3.2 Carrier-based Replacement policies The replacement policies considered in this paper are reactive since a replacement occurs only in response to a request issued for a certain data item.",
                "When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item.",
                "For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.",
                "This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18].",
                "The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random).",
                "We have considered local and global variants of the LRU/LFU policies which determine whether local or global knowledge of contents of the cars known at the dispatcher is used for the eviction decision at a zebroid (see [9] for more details).",
                "The replacement policies incur the following overheads.",
                "First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy.",
                "Second, the bandwidth used to transfer a copy of a data item from a server to the zebroid.",
                "Third, the average number of replacements incurred by the zebroids.",
                "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
                "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids.",
                "First, we present some preliminaries of our analysis methodology. • Let N be the number of cars in the network performing a 2D random walk on a √ G× √ G torus.",
                "An additional car serves as a client yielding a total of N + 1 cars.",
                "Such a mobility model has been used widely in the literature [17, 16] chiefly because it is amenable to analysis and provides a baseline against which performance of other mobility models can be compared.",
                "Moreover, this class of Markovian mobility models has been used to model the movements of vehicles [3, 21]. • We assume that all cars start from the stationary distribution and perform independent random walks.",
                "Although for sparse density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it is no longer valid when N approaches G. • Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also, data item i has ri replicas.",
                "This implies ri cars, identified as servers, have a copy of this data item when the client requests item i.",
                "All analysis results presented in this section are obtained assuming that the client is willing to wait as long as it takes for its request to be satisfied (unbounded trip duration γ = ∞).",
                "With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2].",
                "Extensions to the analysis that also consider finite trip durations can be obtained in [9].",
                "Consider a scenario where no zebroids are employed.",
                "In this case, the expected availability latency for the data item is the expected meeting time of the random walk undertaken by the client with any of the random walks performed by the servers.",
                "Aldous et al. [2] show that the the meeting time of two random walks in such a setting can be modelled as an exponential distribution with the mean C = c · G · log G, where the constant c 0.17 for G ≥ 25.",
                "The meeting time, or equivalently the availability latency δi, for the client requesting data item i is the time till it encounters any of these ri replicas for the first time.",
                "This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value (note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G >> ri): δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items, weighted by their frequency of access: δagg(no − zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri = T i=1 fi · C ri (2) 77 4.1 One-instantaneous zebroids Recall that with one-instantaneous zebroids, for a given request, a new replica is created on a car in the vicinity of the server, provided this car meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.",
                "Moreover, this replica is spawned at the time step when the client issues the request.",
                "Let Nc i be the expected total number of nodes that are in the same cell as any of the ri servers.",
                "Then, we have Nc i = (N − ri) · (1 − (1 − 1 G )ri ) (3) In the analytical model, we assume that Nc i new replicas are created, so that the total number of replicas is increased to ri +Nc i .",
                "The availability latency is reduced since the client is more likely to meet a replica earlier.",
                "The aggregated expected availability latency in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).",
                "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
                "This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",
                "Details of the procedure to obtain a closed-form expression are given in [9].",

                "This is because additional replicas occupy storage without providing benefits. • Either one-instantaneous or z-relay zebroids may be employed per client request for latency improvement. • Unless otherwise mentioned, the prediction accuracy parameter is assumed to be 100%.",
                "This is because this study aims to quantify the effect of a large number of parameters individually on availability latency.",

                "This is because of several reasons.",
                "Recall that the initial replica distribution is set as per the squareroot replication scheme.",
                "The random replacement scheme does not alter this distribution since it makes replacements blind to the popularity of a data item.",

                "Moreover, the mobility pattern of the cars is random, hence, the locations from which the requests are issued by clients are also random and not known a priori at the dispatcher.",
                "These findings are significant because a random replacement policy can be implemented in a simple decentralized manner.",
                "The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.",
                "This is because these policies rapidly develop a preference for the more popular data items thereby creating a larger number of replicas for them.",
                "During eviction, the more popular data items are almost never selected as a replacement candidate.",
                "Consequently, there are fewer replicas for the less popular items.",

                "The higher number of replicas for the popular data items provide marginal additional benefits, while the lower number of replicas for the other data items hurts the latency performance of these global policies.",
                "The lfu-local and lru-local schemes have similar performance to random since they do not have enough history of local data item requests.",

                "However, as N increases, the sparseness assumption for which the analysis is valid, namely N << G, is no longer true.",
                "Hence, the two curves rapidly diverge.",
                "The point at which the two curves move away from each other corresponds to a value of δagg ≤ 1.",
                "Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the analysis provides an upper bound on the latency improvements, as it treats the newly created replicas given by Nc i independently.",
                "However, these Nc i replicas start from the same cell as one of the server replicas ri.",
                "Finally, the analysis captures a oneshot scenario where given an initial data item replica distribution, the availability latency is computed.",
                "The new replicas created do not affect future requests from the client.",
                "On account of space limitations, here, we summarize the observations in the case when z-relay zebroids are employed.",

                "Note that the latency along the quickest delivery path that employs a relay team of z zebroids is similar to that obtained with epidemic routing [19] under the assumptions of infinite storage and no interference.",
                "A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the clients request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity.",
                "Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid.",
                "In some cases, the dispatcher might have inaccurate information about the routes of the cars.",
                "Hence, a zebroid scheduled on the basis of this inaccurate information may not rendezvous with its target client.",
                "To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids.",
                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
                "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",
                "With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane.",
                "Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner.",
                "This remains a future research direction.",
                "Initially, number of replicas for each data item replicas might be computed using Equation 1.",
                "This scheme computes the number of data item replicas as a function of their popularity.",

                "When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item.",
                "For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.",
                "This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18].",
                "The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random).",
                "We have considered local and global variants of the LRU/LFU policies which determine whether local or global knowledge of contents of the cars known at the dispatcher is used for the eviction decision at a zebroid (see [9] for more details).",
                "The replacement policies incur the following overheads.",
                "First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy.",
                "Second, the bandwidth used to transfer a copy of a data item from a server to the zebroid.",
                "Third, the average number of replacements incurred by the zebroids.",
                "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
                "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids.",

                "Such a mobility model has been used widely in the literature [17, 16] chiefly because it is amenable to analysis and provides a baseline against which performance of other mobility models can be compared.",
                "Moreover, this class of Markovian mobility models has been used to model the movements of vehicles [3, 21]. • We assume that all cars start from the stationary distribution and perform independent random walks.",
                "Although for sparse density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it is no longer valid when N approaches G. • Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also, data item i has ri replicas.",
                "This implies ri cars, identified as servers, have a copy of this data item when the client requests item i.",
                "All analysis results presented in this section are obtained assuming that the client is willing to wait as long as it takes for its request to be satisfied (unbounded trip duration γ = ∞).",
                "With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2].",
                "Extensions to the analysis that also consider finite trip durations can be obtained in [9].",
                "Consider a scenario where no zebroids are employed.",
                "In this case, the expected availability latency for the data item is the expected meeting time of the random walk undertaken by the client with any of the random walks performed by the servers.",
                "Aldous et al. [2] show that the the meeting time of two random walks in such a setting can be modelled as an exponential distribution with the mean C = c · G · log G, where the constant c 0.17 for G ≥ 25.",
                "The meeting time, or equivalently the availability latency δi, for the client requesting data item i is the time till it encounters any of these ri replicas for the first time.",
                "This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value (note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G >> ri): δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items, weighted by their frequency of access: δagg(no − zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri = T i=1 fi · C ri (2) 77 4.1 One-instantaneous zebroids Recall that with one-instantaneous zebroids, for a given request, a new replica is created on a car in the vicinity of the server, provided this car meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.",
                "Moreover, this replica is spawned at the time step when the client issues the request.",
                "Let Nc i be the expected total number of nodes that are in the same cell as any of the ri servers.",
                "Then, we have Nc i = (N − ri) · (1 − (1 − 1 G )ri ) (3) In the analytical model, we assume that Nc i new replicas are created, so that the total number of replicas is increased to ri +Nc i .",
                "The availability latency is reduced since the client is more likely to meet a replica earlier.",
                "The aggregated expected availability latency in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).",
                "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
                "This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",
                "Details of the procedure to obtain a closed-form expression are given in [9].",
                "The aggregate availability latency (δagg) with z-relay zebroids is given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 [fi · C N + 1 · 1 N + 1 − ri · (N · log N ri − log (N + 1 − ri))] (5) 5.",
                "SIMULATION METHODOLOGY The simulation environment considered in this study comprises of vehicles such as cars that carry a fraction of the data item repository.",

                "In each time slot, every car makes a transition from a cell to any of its neighboring 8 cells.",
                "The transition is a function of the current location of the car and a probability transition matrix Q = [qij] where qij is the probability of transition from state i to state j.",
                "Only AutoMata equipped cars within the same cell may communicate with each other. • The parameters γ, δ have been discretized and expressed in terms of the number of time slots. • An AutoMata device does not maintain more than one replica of a data item.",
                "This is because additional replicas occupy storage without providing benefits. • Either one-instantaneous or z-relay zebroids may be employed per client request for latency improvement. • Unless otherwise mentioned, the prediction accuracy parameter is assumed to be 100%.",
                "This is because this study aims to quantify the effect of a large number of parameters individually on availability latency.",
                "Here, we set the size of every data item, Si, to be 1. α represents the number of storage slots per AutoMata.",
                "Each storage slot stores one data item. γ represents the duration of the clients journey in terms of the number of time slots.",
                "Hence the possible values of availability latency are between 0 and γ. δ is defined as the number of time slots after which a client AutoMata device will encounter a replica of the data item for the first time.",

                "The figure indicates that a random replacement scheme shows competitive performance.",
                "This is because of several reasons.",
                "Recall that the initial replica distribution is set as per the squareroot replication scheme.",
                "The random replacement scheme does not alter this distribution since it makes replacements blind to the popularity of a data item.",
                "However, the replacements cause dynamic data re-organization so as to better serve the currently active request.",
                "Moreover, the mobility pattern of the cars is random, hence, the locations from which the requests are issued by clients are also random and not known a priori at the dispatcher.",
                "These findings are significant because a random replacement policy can be implemented in a simple decentralized manner.",
                "The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.",
                "This is because these policies rapidly develop a preference for the more popular data items thereby creating a larger number of replicas for them.",
                "During eviction, the more popular data items are almost never selected as a replacement candidate.",
                "Consequently, there are fewer replicas for the less popular items.",
                "Hence, the initial distribution of the data item replicas changes from square-root to that resembling linear replication.",
                "The higher number of replicas for the popular data items provide marginal additional benefits, while the lower number of replicas for the other data items hurts the latency performance of these global policies.",
                "The lfu-local and lru-local schemes have similar performance to random since they do not have enough history of local data item requests.",

                "However, as N increases, the sparseness assumption for which the analysis is valid, namely N << G, is no longer true.",
                "Hence, the two curves rapidly diverge.",
                "The point at which the two curves move away from each other corresponds to a value of δagg ≤ 1.",
                "Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the analysis provides an upper bound on the latency improvements, as it treats the newly created replicas given by Nc i independently.",
                "However, these Nc i replicas start from the same cell as one of the server replicas ri.",
                "Finally, the analysis captures a oneshot scenario where given an initial data item replica distribution, the availability latency is computed.",
                "The new replicas created do not affect future requests from the client.",
                "On account of space limitations, here, we summarize the observations in the case when z-relay zebroids are employed.",
                "The interested reader can obtain further details in [9].",
                "Similar observations, like the one-instantaneous zebroid case, apply since the simulation and analysis curves again start diverging when the analysis assumptions are no longer valid.",
                "However, the key observation here is that the latency improvement with z-relay zebroids is significantly better than the one-instantaneous zebroids case, especially for lower storage scenarios.",
                "This is because in sparse scenarios, the transitive hand-offs between the zebroids creates higher number of replicas for the requested data item, yielding lower availability latency.",

                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same <br>latency</br> improvements.",

                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",

                "All analysis results presented in this section are obtained assuming that the client is willing to wait as long as it takes for its request to be satisfied (unbounded trip duration γ = ∞).",
                "With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2].",

                "The availability <br>latency</br> is reduced since the client is more likely to meet a replica earlier.",
                "The aggregated expected availability <br>latency</br> in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).",
                "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected <br>latency</br> at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar <br>latency</br> to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
                "This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability <br>latency</br> with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",

                "Due to storage constraints, an AutoMata may not store the entire repository.",
                "In this case, availability latency is the time from when the user issues a request until when the AutoMata encounters another car containing the referenced data item. (The terms car and AutoMata are used interchangeably in this study.)",
                "The availability latency for an item is a function of the current location of the client, its destination and travel path, the mobility model of the AutoMata equipped vehicles, the number of replicas constructed for the different data items, and the placement of data item replicas across the vehicles.",

                "Note that the latency along the quickest delivery path that employs a relay team of z zebroids is similar to that obtained with epidemic routing [19] under the assumptions of infinite storage and no interference.",
                "A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the clients request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity.",
                "Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid.",
                "In some cases, the dispatcher might have inaccurate information about the routes of the cars.",
                "Hence, a zebroid scheduled on the basis of this inaccurate information may not rendezvous with its target client.",
                "To minimize the likelihood of such scenarios, the dispatcher may schedule multiple zebroids.",
                "This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.",
                "The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.",
                "With small data items, it is reasonable to assume that this transfer time is small, especially in the presence of the high bandwidth data plane.",
                "Large data items may be divided into smaller chunks enabling the dispatcher to schedule one or more zebroids to deliver each chunk to a client in a timely manner.",
                "This remains a future research direction.",
                "Initially, number of replicas for each data item replicas might be computed using Equation 1.",
                "This scheme computes the number of data item replicas as a function of their popularity.",

                "Eventually, majority of the storage capacity of a car will be exhausted. 3.2 Carrier-based Replacement policies The replacement policies considered in this paper are reactive since a replacement occurs only in response to a request issued for a certain data item.",
                "When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item.",
                "For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.",
                "This decision process is analogous to that encountered in operating system paging where the goal is to maximize the cache hit ratio to prevent disk access delay [18].",
                "The carrier-based replacement policies employed in our study are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Random (where a eviction candidate is chosen uniformly at random).",
                "We have considered local and global variants of the LRU/LFU policies which determine whether local or global knowledge of contents of the cars known at the dispatcher is used for the eviction decision at a zebroid (see [9] for more details).",

                "First, the complexity associated with the implementation of a policy.",
                "Second, the bandwidth used to transfer a copy of a data item from a server to the zebroid.",
                "Third, the average number of replacements incurred by the zebroids.",
                "Note that in the no-zebroids case neither overhead is incurred.",
                "The metrics considered in this study are aggregate availability latency, δagg, percentage improvement in δagg with zebroids as compared to the no-zebroids case and average number of replacements incurred per client request which is an indicator of the overhead incurred by zebroids.",
                "Note that the dispatchers with the help of the control plane may ensure that no data item is lost from the system.",
                "In other words, at least one replica of every data item is maintained in the ad-hoc network at all times.",
                "In such cases, even though a car may meet a requesting client earlier than other servers, if its local storage contains data items with only a single copy in the system, then such a car is not chosen as a zebroid. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids.",

                "Such a mobility model has been used widely in the literature [17, 16] chiefly because it is amenable to analysis and provides a baseline against which performance of other mobility models can be compared.",
                "Moreover, this class of Markovian mobility models has been used to model the movements of vehicles [3, 21]. • We assume that all cars start from the stationary distribution and perform independent random walks.",
                "Although for sparse density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it is no longer valid when N approaches G. • Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also, data item i has ri replicas.",
                "This implies ri cars, identified as servers, have a copy of this data item when the client requests item i.",
                "All analysis results presented in this section are obtained assuming that the client is willing to wait as long as it takes for its request to be satisfied (unbounded trip duration γ = ∞).",
                "With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2].",
                "Extensions to the analysis that also consider finite trip durations can be obtained in [9].",
                "Consider a scenario where no zebroids are employed.",
                "In this case, the expected availability latency for the data item is the expected meeting time of the random walk undertaken by the client with any of the random walks performed by the servers.",
                "Aldous et al. [2] show that the the meeting time of two random walks in such a setting can be modelled as an exponential distribution with the mean C = c · G · log G, where the constant c 0.17 for G ≥ 25.",
                "The meeting time, or equivalently the availability latency δi, for the client requesting data item i is the time till it encounters any of these ri replicas for the first time.",
                "This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value (note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G >> ri): δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items, weighted by their frequency of access: δagg(no − zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri = T i=1 fi · C ri (2) 77 4.1 One-instantaneous zebroids Recall that with one-instantaneous zebroids, for a given request, a new replica is created on a car in the vicinity of the server, provided this car meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.",
                "Moreover, this replica is spawned at the time step when the client issues the request.",
                "Let Nc i be the expected total number of nodes that are in the same cell as any of the ri servers.",
                "Then, we have Nc i = (N − ri) · (1 − (1 − 1 G )ri ) (3) In the analytical model, we assume that Nc i new replicas are created, so that the total number of replicas is increased to ri +Nc i .",
                "The availability latency is reduced since the client is more likely to meet a replica earlier.",
                "The aggregated expected availability latency in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).",
                "It thus treats all the Nc i carriers independently, just like the ri original servers.",
                "As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.",
                "It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).",
                "Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.",
                "This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas. 4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al. [17].",
                "Details of the procedure to obtain a closed-form expression are given in [9].",

                "This is because this study aims to quantify the effect of a large number of parameters individually on availability latency.",
                "Here, we set the size of every data item, Si, to be 1. α represents the number of storage slots per AutoMata.",
                "Each storage slot stores one data item. γ represents the duration of the clients journey in terms of the number of time slots.",
                "Hence the possible values of availability latency are between 0 and γ. δ is defined as the number of time slots after which a client AutoMata device will encounter a replica of the data item for the first time.",
