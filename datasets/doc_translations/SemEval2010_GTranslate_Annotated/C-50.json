CenWits uses several small, commonly-available RF-based sensors, and a small number of storage and processing devices. It is designed for search and rescue of people in emergency situations in wilderness areas. A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation. It is designed for an intermittently connected network that provides only occasional connectivity. It makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center. A prototype of CenWits has been implemented using Berkeley Mica2 motes. The paper describes this implementation and reports on the performance measured from it.

INTRODUCTION Search and rescue of people in emergency situation in a timely manner is an extremely important service. It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation. With the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc. All these systems require a connected network via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices. This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult. For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit. As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas. While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome. Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car. An RF transmitter has a relatively smaller range of transmission. So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area. In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area. In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses). CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors. A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location. The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world. This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world. In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors. In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center. The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network. Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network. As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures. Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective. A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters. Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers. The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions. Groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time. Using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information. In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors. Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory. It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network. This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors. The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application. However, these techniques are quite general. We discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques. While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area. First, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not require a connected network. Second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization. Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we overview some of the recent projects and technologies related to movement and location tracking, and search and rescue systems. In Section 3, we describe the overall architecture of CenWits, and provide a high-level description of its functionality. In the next section, Section 4, we discuss power and memory management in CenWits. To simplify our presentation, we will focus on a specific application of tracking lost/injured hikers in all these sections. In Section 6, we describe a prototype implementation of CenWits and present performance measured from this implementation. We discuss how the ideas of CenWits can be used to build several other applications in Section 7. Finally, in Section 8, we discuss some related issues and conclude the paper. 2. RELATED WORK A survey of location systems for ubiquitous computing is provided in [11]. A location tracking system for adhoc sensor networks using anchor sensors as reference to gain location information and spread it out to outer node is proposed in [17]. Most location tracking systems in adhoc sensor networks are for benefiting geographic-aware routing. They dont fit well for our purposes. The well-known active badge system [19] lets a user carry a badge around. An infrared sensor in the room can detect the presence of a badge and determine the location and identification of the person. This is a useful system for indoor environment, where GPS doesnt work. Locationing using 802.11 devices is probably the cheapest solution for indoor position tracking [8]. Because of the popularity and low cost of 802.11 devices, several business solutions based on this technology have been developed[1]. A system that combines two mature technologies and is viable in suburban area where a user can see clear sky and has GSM cellular reception at the same time is currently available[5]. This system receives GPS signal from a satellite and locates itself, draws location on a map, and sends location information through GSM network to the others who are interested in the users location. A very simple system to monitor children consists an RF transmitter and a receiver. The system alarms the holder of the receiver when the transmitter is about to run out of range [6]. Personal Locater Beacons (PLB) has been used for avalanche rescuing for years. A skier carries an RF transmitter that emits beacons periodically, so that a rescue team can find his/her location based on the strength of the RF signal. Luxury version of PLB combines a GPS receiver and a COSPASSARSAT satellite transmitter that can transmit users location in latitude and longitude to the rescue team whenever an accident happens [4]. However, the device either is turned on all the time resulting in fast battery drain, or must be turned on after the accident to function. Another related technology in widespread use today is the ONSTAR system [3], typically used in several luxury cars. In this system, a GPS unit provides position information, and a powerful transmitter relays that information via satellite to a customer service center. Designed for emergencies, the system can be triggered either by the user with the push of a button, or by a catastrophic accident. Once the system has been triggered, a human representative attempts to gain communication with the user via a cell phone built as an incar device. If contact cannot be made, emergency services are dispatched to the location provided by GPS. Like PLBs, this system has several limitations. First, it is heavy and expensive. It requires a satellite transmitter and a connected network. If connectivity with either the GPS network or a communication satellite cannot be maintained, the system fails. Unfortunately, these are common obstacles encountered in deep canyons, narrow streets in large cities, parking garages, and a number of other places. 181 The Lifetch system uses GPS receiver board combined with a GSM/GPRS transmitter and an RF transmitter in one wireless sensor node called Intelligent Communication Unit (ICU). An ICU first attempts to transmit its location to a control center through GSM/GPRS network. If that fails, it connects with other ICUs (adhoc network) to forward its location information until the information reaches an ICU that has GSM/GPRS reception. This ICU then transmits the location information of the original ICU via the GSM/GPRS network. ZebraNet is a system designed to study the moving patterns of zebras [13]. It utilizes two protocols: History-based protocol and flooding protocol. History-based protocol is used when the zebras are grazing and not moving around too much. While this might be useful for tracking zebras, its not suitable for tracking hikers because two hikers are most likely to meet each other only once on a trail. In the flooding protocol, a node dumps its data to a neighbor whenever it finds one and doesnt delete its own copy until it finds a base station. Without considering routing loops, packet filtering and grouping, the size of data on a node will grow exponentially and drain the power and memory of a sensor node with in a short time. Instead, Cenwits uses a four-phase hand-shake protocol to ensure that a node transmits only as much information as the other node is willing to receive. While ZebraNet is designed for a big group of sensors moving together in the same direction with same speed, Cenwits is designed to be used in the scenario where sensors move in different directions at different speeds. Delay tolerant network architecture addresses some important problems in challenged (resource-constrained) networks [9]. While this work is mainly concerned with interoperability of challenged networks, some problems related to occasionally-connected networks are similar to the ones we have addressed in CenWits. Among all these systems, luxury PLB and Lifetch are designed for location tracking in wilderness areas. However, both of these systems require a connected network. Luxury PLB requires the user to transmit a signal to a satellite, while Lifetch requires connection to GSM/GPRS network. Luxury PLB transmits location information, only when an accident happens. However, if the user is buried in the snow or falls into a deep canyon, there is almost no chance for the signal to go through and be relayed to the rescue team. This is because satellite transmission needs line of sight. Furthermore, since there is no known history of users location, it is not possible for the rescue team to infer the current location of the user. Another disadvantage of luxury PLB is that a satellite transmitter is very expensive, costing in the range of $750. Lifetch attempts to transmit the location information by GSM/GPRS and adhoc sensor network that uses AODV as the routing protocol. However, having a cellular reception in remote areas in wilderness areas, e.g. American national parks is unlikely. Furthermore, it is extremely unlikely that ICUs worn by hikers will be able to form an adhoc network in a large wilderness area. This is because the hikers are mobile and it is very unlikely to have several ICUs placed dense enough to forward packets even on a very popular hike route. CenWits is designed to address the limitations of systems such as luxury PLB and Lifetch. It is designed to provide hikers, skiers, and climbers who have their activities mainly in wilderness areas a much higher chance to convey their location information to a control center. It is not reliant upon constant connectivity with any communication medium. Rather, it communicates information along from user to user, finally arriving at a control center. Unlike several of the systems discussed so far, it does not require that a users unit is constantly turned on. In fact, it can discover a victims location, even if the victims sensor was off at the time of accident and has remained off since then. CenWits solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability. This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well. Figure 1: Hiker A and Hiker B are are not in the range of each other 3. CENWITS We describe CenWits in the context of locating lost/injured hikers in wilderness areas. Each hiker wears a sensor (MICA2 motes in our prototype) equipped with a GPS receiver and an RF transmitter. Each sensor is assigned a unique ID and maintains its current location based on the signal received by its GPS receiver. It also emits beacons periodically. When any two sensors are in the range of one another, they record the presence of each other (witness information), and also exchange the witness information they recorded earlier. The key idea here is that if two sensors come with in range of each other at any time, they become each others witnesses. Later on, if the hiker wearing one of these sensors is lost, the other sensor can convey the last known (witnessed) location of the lost hiker. Furthermore, by exchanging the witness information that each sensor recorded earlier, the witness information is propagated beyond a direct contact between two sensors. To convey witness information to a processing center or to a rescue team, access points are established at well-known locations that the hikers are expected to pass through, e.g. at the trail heads, trail ends, intersection of different trails, scenic view points, resting areas, and so on. Whenever a sensor node is in the vicinity of an access point, all witness information stored in that sensor is automatically dumped to the access point. Access points are connected to a processing center via satellite or some other network1 . The witness information is downloaded to the processing center from various access points at regular intervals. In case, connection to an access point is lost, the information from that 1 A connection is needed only between access points and a processing center. There is no need for any connection between different access points. 182 access point can be downloaded manually, e.g. by UAVs. To estimate the speed, location and direction of a hiker at any point in time, all witness information of that hiker that has been collected from various access points is processed. Figure 2: Hiker A and Hiker B are in the range of each other. A records the presence of B and B records the presence of A. A and B become each others witnesses. Figure 3: Hiker A is in the range of an access point. It uploads its recorded witness information and clears its memory. An example of how CenWits operates is illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3. First, hikers A and B are on two close trails, but out of range of each other (Figure 1). This is a very common scenario during a hike. For example, on a popular four-hour hike, a hiker might run into as many as 20 other hikers. This accounts for one encounter every 12 minutes on average. A slow hiker can go 1 mile (5,280 feet) per hour. Thus in 12 minutes a slow hiker can go as far as 1056 feet. This implies that if we were to put 20 hikers on a 4-hour, one-way hike evenly, the range of each sensor node should be at least 1056 feet for them to communicate with one another continuously. The signal strength starts dropping rapidly for two Mica2 nodes to communicate with each other when they are 180 feet away, and is completely lost when they are 230 feet away from each other[7]. So, for the sensors to form a sensor network on a 4-hour hiking trail, there should be at least 120 hikers scattered evenly. Clearly, this is extremely unlikely. In fact, in a 4-hour, less-popular hiking trail, one might only run into say five other hikers. CenWits takes advantage of the fact that sensors can communicate with one another and record their presence. Given a walking speed of one mile per hour (88 feet per minute) and Mica2 range of about 150 feet for non-line-of-sight radio transmission, two hikers have about 150/88 = 1.7 minutes to discover the presence of each other and exchange their witness information. We therefore design our system to have each sensor emit a beacon every one-and-a-half minute. In Figure 2, hiker Bs sensor emits a beacon when A is in range, this triggers A to exchange data with B. A communicates the following information to B: My ID is A; I saw C at 1:23 PM at (39◦ 49.3277655, 105◦ 39.1126776), I saw E at 3:09 PM at (40◦ 49.2234879, 105◦ 20.3290168). B then replies with My ID is B; I saw K at 11:20 AM at (39◦ 51.4531655, 105◦ 41.6776223). In addition, A records I saw B at 4:17 PM at (41◦ 29.3177354, 105◦ 04.9106211) and B records I saw A at 4:17 PM at (41◦ 29.3177354, 105◦ 04.9106211). B goes on his way to overnight camping while A heads back to trail head where there is an AP, which emits beacon every 5 seconds to avoid missing any hiker. A dumps all witness information it has collected to the access point. This is shown in Figure 3. 3.1 Witness Information: Storage A critical concern is that there is limited amount of memory available on motes (4 KB SDRAM memory, 128 KB flash memory, and 4-512 KB EEPROM). So, it is important to organize witness information efficiently. CenWits stores witness information at each node as a set of witness records (Format is shown in Figure 4. 1 B Node ID Record Time X, Y Location Time Hop Count 1 B 3 B 8 B 3 B Figure 4: Format of a witness record. When two nodes i and j encounter each other, each node generates a new witness record. In the witness record generated by i, Node ID is j, Record Time is the current time in is clock, (X,Y) are the coordinates of the location of i that i recorded most recently (either from satellite or an LP), Location Time is the time when the this location was recorded, and Hop Count is 0. Each node is assigned a unique Node Id when it enters a trail. In our current prototype, we have allocated one byte for Node Id, although this can be increased to two or more bytes if a large number of hikers are expected to be present at the same time. We can represent time in 17 bits to a second precision. So, we have allocated 3 bytes each for Record Time and Location Time. The circumference of the Earth is approximately 40,075 KM. If we use a 32-bit number to represent both longitude and latitude, the precision we get is 40,075,000/232 = 0.0093 meter = 0.37 inches, which is quite precise for our needs. So, we have allocated 4 bytes each for X and Y coordinates of the location of a node. In fact, a foot precision can be achieved by using only 27 bits. 3.2 Location Point and Location Inference Although a GPS receiver provides an accurate location information, it has its limitation. In canyons and rainy forests, a GPS receiver does not work. When there is a heavy cloud cover, GPS users have experienced inaccuracy in the reported location as well. Unfortunately, a lot of hiking trails are in dense forests and canyons, and its not that uncommon to rain after hikers start hiking. To address this, CenWits incorporates the idea of location points (LP). A location point can update a sensor node with its current location whenever the node is near that LP. LPs are placed at different locations in a wilderness area where GPS receivers dont work. An LP is a very simple device that emits prerecorded location information at some regular time interval. It can be placed in difficult-to-reach places such as deep canyons and dense rain forests by simply dropping them from an airplane. LPs allow a sensor node to determine its current location more accurately. However, they are not 183 an essential requirement of CenWits. If an LP runs out of power, the CenWits will continue to work correctly. Figure 5: GPS receiver not working correctly. Sensors then have to rely on LP to provide coordination In Figure 5, B cannot get GPS reception due to bad weather. It then runs into A on the trail who doesnt have GPS reception either. Their sensors record the presence of each other. After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A. When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter location of A and B. By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be inferred. Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8). Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset. CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another. Such a synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available. In addition, sensor nodes in CenWits synchronize their clocks whenever they are in the range of an AP or an LP. The Figure 8: Based on overlapping landscape, B might have hiked to wrong branch and fallen off a cliff. Hot rescue areas can thus be determined synchronization accuracy Cenwits needs is of the order of a second or so. As long as the clocks are synchronized with in one second range, whether A met B at 12:3745 or 12:3746 doesnt matter in the ordering of witness events and inferring the path. 4. MEMORY AND POWER MANAGEMENT CenWits employs several important mechanisms to conserve power and memory. It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory. With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of witness information stored at a node can get very large. This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of witness information over time. To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically. This raises an interesting question of when and which witness record should be deleted from the memory of a node? CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap. Record count refers to the number of witness records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory. A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT. It stores at most MAX RECORD COUNT witness records of any node. Every witness record has a hop count field that stores the number times (hops) this record has been transferred since being created. Initially this field is set to 0. Whenever a node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1. A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT. It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT. The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes. We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet. The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up. For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes. On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node. Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two witness records with the same node id. To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two witness records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP. For each node id i, n stores the witness record with the most recent record time rti, the witness with most recent record time that is at least MIN RECORD GAP time units before rti, and so on until the record count limit (MAX RECORD COUNT) is reached. When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory. It decrements MAX RECORD COUNT and MAX HOP COUNT, and increments MIN RECORD GAP. It then first erases all witness records whose hop count exceeds the reduced MAX HOP COUNT value, and then erases witness records to satisfy the record gap criteria. Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its witness information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions. For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a beacon every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour. However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a beacon should be emitted every 10 seconds. If a user is not moving at all, a beacon can be emitted every 10 minutes. In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time. If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy. In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals. For example, suppose hiker A has communicated its witness information to three other hikers in the last five minutes. If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes. It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional witness information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes. It goes to sleep mode if it is extremely low on power. The bandwidth and energy limitations of sensor nodes require that the amount of data transferred among the nodes be reduced to minimum. It has been observed that in some scenarios 3000 instructions could be executed for the same energy cost of sending a bit 100m by radio [15]. To reduce the amount of data transfer, CenWits employs a handshake protocol that two nodes execute when they encounter one another. The goal of this protocol is to ensure that a node transmits only as much witness information as the other node is willing to receive. This protocol is initiated when a node i receives a beacon containing the node ID of the sender node j and i has not exchanged witness information with j in the last δ time units. Assume that i < j. The protocol consists of four phases (See Figure 9): 1. Phase I: Node i sends its receive constraints and the number of witness records it has in its memory. 2. Phase II: On receiving this message from i, j sends its receive constraints and the number of witness records it has in its memory. 3. Phase III: On receiving the above message from j, i sends its witness information (filtered based on receive constraints received in phase II). 4. Phase IV: After receiving the witness records from i, j sends its witness information (filtered based on receive constraints received in phase I). j <Constaints, Witness info size> <Constaints, Witness info size> <Filtered Witness info> <Filtered Witness info> i j j j i i i Figure 9: Four-Phase Hand Shake Protocol (i < j) Receive constraints are a function of memory and power. In the most general case, they are comprised of the three parameters (record count, hop count and record gap) used for memory management. If i is low on memory, it specifies the maximum number of records it is willing to accept from j. Similarly, i can ask j to send only those records that have hop count value less than MAX HOP COUNT − 1. Finally, i can include its MIN RECORD GAP value in its receive constraints. Note that the handshake protocol is beneficial to both i and j. They save memory by receiving only as much information as they are willing to accept and conserve energy by sending only as many witness records as needed. It turns out that filtering witness records based on MIN RECORD GAP is complex. It requires that the witness records of any given node be arranged in an order sorted by their record time values. Maintaining this sorted order is complex in memory, because new witness records with the same node id can arrive later that may have to be inserted in between to preserve the sorted order. For this reason, the receive constraints in the current CenWits prototype do not include record gap. Suppose i specifies a hop count value of 3. In this case, j checks the hop count field of every witness record before sending them. If the hop count value is greater than 3, the record is not transmitted. 4.3 Groups and Partitions To further reduce communication and increase the lifetime of our system, we introduce the notion of groups. The idea is based on the concept of abstract regions presented in [20]. A group is a set of n nodes that can be defined in terms of radio connectivity, geographic location, or other properties of nodes. All nodes within a group can communicate directly with one another and they share information to maintain their view of the external world. At any point in time, a group has exactly one leader that communicates 185 with external nodes on behalf of the entire group. A group can be static, meaning that the group membership does not change over the period of time, or it could be dynamic in which case nodes can leave or join the group. To make our analysis simple and to explain the advantages of group, we first discuss static groups. A static group is formed at the start of a hiking trail or ski slope. Suppose there are five family members who want to go for a hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park. Before these members start their hike, each one of them is given a sensor node and the information is entered in the system that the five nodes form a group. Each group member is given a unique id and every group member knows about other members of the group. The group, as a whole, is also assigned an id to distinguish it from other groups in the system. Figure 10: A group of five people. Node 2 is the group leader and it is communicating on behalf of the group with an external node 17. All other (shown in a lighter shade) are in sleep mode. As the group moves through the trail, it exchanges information with other nodes or groups that it comes across. At any point in time, only one group member, called the leader, sends and receives information on behalf of the group and all other n − 1 group members are put in the sleep mode (See Figure 10). It is this property of groups that saves us energy. The group leadership is time-multiplexed among the group members. This is done to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery due to continuous exchange of information. Thus after every t seconds, the leadership is passed on to another node, called the successor, and the leader (now an ordinary member) is put to sleep. Since energy is dear, we do not implement an extensive election algorithm for choosing the successor. Instead, we choose the successor on the basis of node id. The node with the next highest id in the group is chosen as the successor. The last node, of course, chooses the node with the lowest id as its successor. We now discuss the data storage schemes for groups. Memory is a scarce resource in sensor nodes and it is therefore important that witness information be stored efficiently among group members. Efficient data storage is not a trivial task when it comes to groups. The tradeoff is between simplicity of the scheme and memory savings. A simpler scheme incurs lesser energy cost as compared to a more sophisticated scheme, but offers lesser memory savings as well. This is because in a more complicated scheme, the group members have to coordinate to update and store information. After considering a number of different schemes, we have come to a conclusion that there is no optimal storage scheme for groups. The system should be able to adapt according to its requirements. If group members are low on battery, then the group can adapt a scheme that is more energy efficient. Similarly, if the group members are running out of memory, they can adapt a scheme that is more memory efficient. We first present a simple scheme that is very energy efficient but does not offer significant memory savings. We then present an alternate scheme that is much more memory efficient. As already mentioned a group can receive information only through the group leader. Whenever the leader comes across an external node e, it receives information from that node and saves it. In our first scheme, when the timeslot for the leader expires, the leader passes this new information it received from e to its successor. This is important because during the next time slot, if the new leader comes across another external node, it should be able to pass information about all the external nodes this group has witnessed so far. Thus the information is fully replicated on all nodes to maintain the correct view of the world. Our first scheme does not offer any memory savings but is highly energy efficient and may be a good choice when the group members are running low on battery. Except for the time when the leadership is switched, all n − 1 members are asleep at any given time. This means that a single member is up for t seconds once every n∗t seconds and therefore has to spend approximately only 1/nth of its energy. Thus, if there are 5 members in a group, we save 80% energy, which is huge. More energy can be saved by increasing the group size. We now present an alternate data storage scheme that aims at saving memory at the cost of energy. In this scheme we divide the group into what we call partitions. Partitions can be thought of as subgroups within a group. Each partition must have at least two nodes in it. The nodes within a partition are called peers. Each partition has one peer designated as partition leader. The partition leader stays in receive mode at all times, while all others peers a partition stay in the sleep mode. Partition leadership is time-multiplexed among the peers to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery. Like before, a group has exactly one leader and the leadership is time-multiplexed among partitions. The group leader also serves as the partition leader for the partition it belongs to (See Figure 11). In this scheme, all partition leaders participate in information exchange. Whenever a group comes across an external node e, every partition leader receives all witness information, but it only stores a subset of that information after filtering. Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send witness information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to. However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode. Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their witness information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide. All this is achieved by having the group leader send a signal to every partition leader in turn. 186 Figure 11: The figure shows a group of eight nodes divided into four partitions of 2 nodes each. Node 1 is the group leader whereas nodes 2, 9, and 7 are partition leaders. All other nodes are in the sleep mode. Since the partition leadership is time-multiplexed, it is important that any information received by the partition leader, p1, be passed on to the next leader, p2. This has to be done to make sure that p2 has all the information that it might need to send when it comes across another external node during its timeslot. One way of achieving this is to wake p2 up just before p1s timeslot expires and then have p1 transfer information only to p2. An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers. Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep. In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information. In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes. In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers. Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one. A group can be divided into partitions in more than one way. For example, suppose we have a group of six members. We can divide this group into three partitions of two peers each, or two partitions with three peers each. The choice once again depends on the requirements of the system. A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient. This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time. On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12). A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery. This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node. For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node. Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all witness information stored in that partition will be lost. We have devised a very simple protocol to solve this problem. We first explain how partiFigure 12: The figure shows two different ways of partitioning a group of six nodes. In (a), a group is divided into three partitions of two nodes. Node 1 is the group leader, nodes 9 and 5 are partition leaders, and nodes 2, 3, and 6 are in sleep mode. In (b) the group is divided into two partitions of three nodes. Node 1 is the group leader, node 9 is the partition leader and nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6 are in sleep mode. tions are adjusted when a peer dies, and then explain what happens if a partition leader dies. Suppose node 2 in figure 3 (a) dies. When node 5, the partition leader, sends information to node 2, it does not receive an acknowledgement from it and concludes that node 2 has died2 . At this point, node 5 contacts other partition leaders (nodes 1 ... 9) using a broadcast message and informs them that one of its peers has died. Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of witness information stored in its partition. Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders. Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition. However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition. It chooses the partition that has the least amount of witness information to join. It sends its witness information to the new partition leader. Witness information and membership update is propagated to all peers during the next partition leadership change. We now consider the case where the partition leader dies. If this happens, then we wait for the partition leadership to change and for the new partition leader to eventually find out that a peer has died. Once the new partition leader finds out that it needs more peers, it proceeds with the protocol explained above. However, in this case, we do lose information that the previous partition leader might have received just before it died. This problem can be solved by implementing a more rigorous protocol, but we have decided to give up on accuracy to save energy. Our current design uses time-division multiplexing to schedule wakeup and sleep modes in the sensor nodes. However, recent work on radio wakeup sensors [10] can be used to do this scheduling more efficiently. we plan to incorporate radio wakeup sensors in CenWits when the hardware is mature. 2 The algorithm to conclude that a node has died can be made more rigorous by having the partition leader query the suspected node a few times. 187 5. SYSTEM EVALUATION A sensor is constrained in the amount of memory and power. In general, the amount of memory needed and power consumption depends on a variety of factors such as node density, number of hiker encounters, and the number of access points. In this Section, we provide an estimate of how long the power of a MICA2 mote will last under certain assumtions. First, we assume that each sensor node carries about 100 witness records. On encountering another hiker, a sensor node transmits 50 witness records and receives 50 new witness records. Since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take 0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34 seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link. The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh. Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per hour. So, average power consumtion due to transmission and reception is (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 mA per hour. Given that the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500 mAh, a battery should last for 2500/15.75 = 159 hours of transmission and reception. An encounter between two hikers results in exchange of about 50 witness records that takes about 0.68 seconds as calculated above. Thus, a single alkaline battery can last for (159 ∗ 60 ∗ 60)/0.68 = 841764 hiker encounters. Assuming that a node emits a beacon every 90 seconds and a hiker encounter occurs everytime a beacon is emitted (worst-case scenario), a single alkaline battery will last for (841764 ∗ 90)/(30 ∗ 24 ∗ 60 ∗ 60) = 29 days. Since, a Mica2 is equipped with two batteries, a Mica2 sensor can remain operation for about two months. Notice that this calculation is preliminary, because it assumes that hikers are active 24 hours of the day and a hiker encounter occurs every 90 seconds. In a more realistic scenario, power is expected to last for a much longer time period. Also, this time period will significantly increase when groups of hikers are moving together. Finally, the lifetime of a sensor running on two batteries can definitely be increased significantly by using energy scavenging techniques and energy harvesting techniques [16, 14]. 6. PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION We have implemented a prototype of CenWits on MICA2 sensor 900MHz running Mantis OS 0.9.1b. One of the sensor is equipped with MTS420CA GPS module, which is capable of barometric pressure and two-axis acceleration sensing in addition to GPS location tracking. We use SiRF, the serial communication protocol, to control GPS module. SiRF has a rich command set, but we record only X and Y coordinates. A witness record is 16 bytes long. When a node starts up, it stores its current location and emits a beacon periodicallyin the prototype, a node emits a beacon every minute. We have conducted a number of experiments with this prototype. A detailed report on these experiments with the raw data collected and photographs of hikers, access points etc. is available at http://csel.cs.colorado.edu/∼huangjh/ Cenwits.index.htm. Here we report results from three of them. In all these experiments, there are three access points (A, B and C) where nodes dump their witness information. These access points also provide location information to the nodes that come with in their range. We first show how CenWits can be used to determine the hiking trail a hiker is most likely on and the speed at which he is hiking, and identify hot search areas in case he is reported missing. Next, we show the results of power and memory management techniques of CenWits in conserving power and memory of a sensor node in one of our experiments. 6.1 Locating Lost Hikers The first experiment is called Direct Contact. It is a very simple experiment in which a single hiker starts from A, goes to B and then C, and finally returns to A (See Figure 13). The goal of this experiment is to illustrate that CenWits can deduce the trail a hiker takes by processing witness information. Figure 13: Direct Contact Experiment Node Id Record (X,Y) Location Hop Time Time Count 1 15 (12,7) 15 0 1 33 (31,17) 33 0 1 46 (12,23) 46 0 1 10 (12,7) 10 0 1 48 (12,23) 48 0 1 16 (12,7) 16 0 1 34 (31,17) 34 0 Table 1: Witness information collected in the direct contact experiment. The witness information dumped at the three access points was then collected and processed at a control center. Part of the witness information collected at the control center is shown in Table 1. The X,Y locations in this table correspond to the location information provided by access points A, B, and C. A is located at (12,7), B is located at (31,17) and C is located at (12,23). Three encounter points (between hiker 1 and the three access points) extracted from 188 this witness information are shown in Figure 13 (shown in rectangular boxes). For example, A,1 at 16 means 1 came in contact with A at time 16. Using this information, we can infer the direction in which hiker 1 was moving and speed at which he was moving. Furthermore, given a map of hiking trails in this area, it is clearly possible to identify the hiking trail that hiker 1 took. The second experiment is called Indirect Inference. This experiment is designed to illustrate that the location, direction and speed of a hiker can be inferred by CenWits, even if the hiker never comes in the range of any access point. It illustrates the importance of witness information in search and rescue applications. In this experiment, there are three hikers, 1, 2 and 3. Hiker 1 takes a trail that goes along access points A and B, while hiker 3 takes trail that goes along access points C and B. Hiker 2 takes a trail that does not come in the range of any access points. However, this hiker meets hiker 1 and 3 during his hike. This is illustrated in Figure 14. Figure 14: Indirect Inference Experiment Node Id Record (X,Y) Location Hop Time Time Count 2 16 (12,7) 6 0 2 15 (12,7) 6 0 1 4 (12,7) 4 0 1 6 (12,7) 6 0 1 29 (31,17) 29 0 1 31 (31,17) 31 0 Table 2: Witness information collected from hiker 1 in indirect inference experiment. Part of the witness information collected at the control center from access points A, B and C is shown in Tables 2 and 3. There are some interesting data in these tables. For example, the location time in some witness records is not the same as the record time. This means that the node that generated that record did not have its most up-to-date location at the encounter time. For example, when hikers 1 and 2 meet at time 16, the last recorded location time of Node Id Record (X,Y) Location Hop Time Time Count 3 78 (12,23) 78 0 3 107 (31,17) 107 0 3 106 (31,17) 106 0 3 76 (12,23) 76 0 3 79 (12,23) 79 0 2 94 (12,23) 79 0 1 16 (?,?) ? 1 1 15 (?,?) ? 1 Table 3: Witness information collected from hiker 3 in indirect inference experiment. hiker 1 is (12,7) recorded at time 6. So, node 1 generates a witness record with record time 16, location (12,7) and location time 6. In fact, the last two records in Table 3 have (?,?) as their location. This has happened because these witness records were generate by hiker 2 during his encounter with 1 at time 15 and 16. Until this time, hiker 2 hadnt come in contact with any location points. Interestingly, a more accurate location information of 1 and 2 encounter or 2 and 3 encounter can be computed by process the witness information at the control center. It took 25 units of time for hiker 1 to go from A (12,7) to B (31,17). Assuming a constant hiking speed and a relatively straight-line hike, it can be computed that at time 16, hiker 1 must have been at location (18,10). Thus (18,10) is a more accurate location of encounter between 1 and 2. Finally, our third experiment called Identifying Hot Search Areas is designed to determine the trail a hiker has taken and identify hot search areas for rescue after he is reported missing. There are six hikers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) in this experiment. Figure 15 shows the trails that hikers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 took, along with the encounter points obtained from witness records collected at the control center. For brevity, we have not shown the entire witness information collected at the control center. This information is available at http://csel.cs.colorado.edu/∼huangjh/Cenwits/index.htm. Figure 15: Identifying Hot Search Area Experiment (without hiker 6) 189 Now suppose hiker 6 is reported missing at time 260. To determine the hot search areas, the witness records of hiker 6 are processed to determine the trail he is most likely on, the speed at which he had been moving, direction in which he had been moving, and his last known location. Based on this information and the hiking trail map, hot search areas are identified. The hiking trail taken by hiker 6 as inferred by CenWits is shown by a dotted line and the hot search areas identified by CenWits are shown by dark lines inside the dotted circle in Figure 16. Figure 16: Identifying Hot Search Area Experiment (with hiker 6) 6.2 Results of Power and Memory Management The witness information shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3 has not been filtered using the three criteria described in Section 4.1. For example, the witness records generated by 3 at record times 76, 78 and 79 (see Table 3) have all been generated due a single contact between access point C and node 3. By applying the record gap criteria, two of these three records will be erased. Similarly, the witness records generated by 1 at record times 10, 15 and 16 (see Table 1) have all been generated due a single contact between access point A and node 1. Again, by applying the record gap criteria, two of these three records will be erased. Our experiments did not generate enough data to test the impact of record count or hop count criteria. To evaluate the impact of these criteria, we simulated CenWits to generate a significantly large number of records for a given number of hikers and access points. We generated witness records by having the hikers walk randomly. We applied the three criteria to measure the amount of memory savings in a sensor node. The results are shown in Table 4. The number of hikers in this simulation was 10 and the number of access points was 5. The number of witness records reported in this table is an average number of witness records a sensor node stored at the time of dump to an access point. These results show that the three memory management criteria significantly reduces the memory consumption of sensor nodes in CenWits. For example, they can reduce MAX MIN MAX # of RECORD RECORD HOP Witness COUNT GAP COUNT Records 5 5 5 628 4 5 5 421 3 5 5 316 5 10 5 311 5 20 5 207 5 5 4 462 5 5 3 341 3 20 3 161 Table 4: Impact of memory management techniques. the memory consumption by up to 75%. However, these results are premature at present for two reasons: (1) They are generated via simulation of hikers walking at random; and (2) It is not clear what impact the erasing of witness records has on the accuracy of inferred location/hot search areas of lost hikers. In our future work, we plan to undertake a major study to address these two concerns. 7. OTHER APPLICATIONS In addition to the hiking in wilderness areas, CenWits can be used in several other applications, e.g. skiing, climbing, wild life monitoring, and person tracking. Since CenWits relies only on intermittent connectivity, it can take advantage of the existing cheap and mature technologies, and thereby make tracking cheaper and fairly accurate. Since CenWits doesnt rely on keeping track of a sensor holder all time, but relies on maintaining witnesses, the system is relatively cheaper and widely applicable. For example, there are some dangerous cliffs in most ski resorts. But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain. Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries. These boundary sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff. Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs. If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier. If there is no witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed. In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals. To collect data, either a satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver. GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2]. Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds. Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it. Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of deers. CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces. CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case. Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data. In fact, the access points need not be statically located. They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife. In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesnt work indoor and near skyscrapers. If a person A is reported missing, and from the witness records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 8. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new search and rescue system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current search and rescue systems. These advantages include a looselycoupled system that relies only on intermittent network connectivity, power and storage efficiency, and low cost. It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability. This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well. It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies. A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes. In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors. An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets. This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets. We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment. While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system. We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present. Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability. There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits. For example, an adversary can sniff the witness information to locate endangered animals, females, children, etc. He may inject false information in the system. An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency. In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy. So, a bullet-proof security is not really required. However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change. Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail. In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved. Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits. So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors. Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment. In particular, discussions are currenly underway to deploy CenWits in the Rocky Mountain and Yosemite National Parks. 9.

CENWITS utiliza varios sensores pequeños, comúnmente disponibles basados en RF, y una pequeña cantidad de dispositivos de almacenamiento y procesamiento. Está diseñado para la búsqueda y el rescate de las personas en situaciones de emergencia en áreas silvestres. Una característica clave de CENWITS es que no requiere una red de sensores conectada continuamente para su funcionamiento. Está diseñado para una red conectada intermitentemente que proporciona solo conectividad ocasional. Hace un uso juicioso de la capacidad de almacenamiento combinada de los sensores para filtrar, organizar y almacenar información importante, la potencia combinada de la batería de los sensores para garantizar que el sistema permanezca operativo durante períodos de tiempo más largos y la conectividad de la red intermitente para propagar información a un centro de procesamiento. Se ha implementado un prototipo de CENWITS utilizando Berkeley Mica2 Motes. El documento describe esta implementación e informes sobre el rendimiento medido a partir de él.

Introducción La búsqueda y el rescate de las personas en situación de emergencia de manera oportuna es un servicio extremadamente importante. Ha sido difícil proporcionar dicho servicio debido a la falta de información oportuna necesaria para determinar la ubicación actual de una persona que puede estar en una situación de emergencia. Con la aparición de computación generalizada, se han desarrollado varios sistemas [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] en los últimos años que utilizan pequeños dispositivos como teléfonos celulares, sensores, etc. Todos estos sistemas requieren una red conectada a través de satélites, estaciones base GSM o dispositivos móviles. Este requisito limita severamente su aplicabilidad, particularmente en áreas de desierto remotas donde mantener una red conectada es muy difícil. Por ejemplo, un transmisor GSM debe estar en el rango de una estación base para transmitir. Como resultado, no puede operar en la mayoría de las áreas silvestres. Si bien un transmisor satelital es la única solución viable en las áreas del desierto, es típicamente costosa y engorrosa. Además, se requiere una línea de visión para transmitir al satélite, y eso hace que no sea conectado en cañones estrechos, grandes ciudades con rascacielos, bosques tropicales o incluso cuando hay un techo o alguna otra obstrucción por encima del transmisor, p.en un auto. Un transmisor de RF tiene un rango de transmisión relativamente más pequeño. Por lo tanto, si bien un sensor in situ es barato como una sola unidad, es costoso construir una red grande que pueda proporcionar conectividad en un gran área silvestre. En un entorno móvil donde los sensores son transportados por personas en movimiento, el enrutamiento de eficiencia eléctrica es difícil de implementar y mantener en un gran área silvestre. De hecho, construir una red de sensores ADHOC que use solo los sensores usados por los excursionistas es casi imposible debido a un número relativamente pequeño de sensores extendidos sobre un área desierto grande. En este artículo, describimos el diseño, implementación y evaluación de un sistema de búsqueda y rescate llamado CENWITS (sistema de seguimiento basado en sensores sin conexión utilizando testigos). CENWITS se compone de sensores móviles, in situ que usan sujetos (personas, animales salvajes o objetos inanimados), puntos de acceso (AP) que recopilan información de estos sensores y receptores GPS y puntos de ubicación (LP) queProporcione información de ubicación a los sensores. Un sujeto utiliza receptores GPS (cuando puede conectarse a un satélite) y LPS para determinar su ubicación actual. La idea clave de Cenwits es que utiliza un concepto de testigos para transmitir un movimiento de temas y información de ubicación al mundo exterior. Esto evita la necesidad de mantener una red conectada para transmitir información de ubicación al mundo exterior. En particular, no hay necesidad de transmisores costosos de GSM o satélite, o mantener una red ADHOC de sensores in situ en CENWITS.180 CENWITS emplea varios mecanismos importantes para abordar el problema clave de las restricciones de recursos (baja resistencia a la señal, baja potencia y memoria limitada) en los sensores. En particular, hace un uso juicioso de la capacidad de almacenamiento combinada de los sensores para filtrar, organizar y almacenar información importante, potencia combinada de la batería de los sensores para garantizar que el sistema permanezca operativo durante períodos de tiempo más largos y conectividad de red intermitente para propagar información a uncentro de procesamiento. El problema de las fuerzas de señal bajas (comunicación de RF de corto alcance) se aborda evitando la necesidad de mantener una red conectada. En cambio, CenWits propaga la información de ubicación de los sensores utilizando el concepto de testigos a través de una red conectada intermitentemente. Como resultado, este sistema se puede implementar en áreas de desierto remotas, así como en grandes áreas urbanas con rascacielos y otras estructuras altas. Además, esto hace que Cenwits sea rentable. Un sujeto solo necesita usar sensores livianos y de bajo costo que tengan receptores GPS pero que no hay transmisores caros de GSM o satélite. Además, dado que no hay necesidad de una red de sensores conectados, no hay necesidad de implementar sensores en cantidades muy grandes. El problema de la duración limitada de la batería y la memoria limitada de un sensor se aborda incorporando los conceptos de grupos y particiones. Los grupos y las particiones permiten que los sensores permanezcan en el sueño o reciban modos la mayor parte del tiempo. Utilizando grupos y particiones, la información de ubicación recopilada por un sensor se puede distribuir entre varios sensores, reduciendo así la cantidad de memoria necesaria en un sensor para almacenar esa información. De hecho, CENWITS proporciona una compensación adaptativa entre la memoria y el consumo de energía de los sensores. Cada sensor puede ajustar dinámicamente su potencia y consumo de memoria en función de su potencia restante o memoria disponible. Se ha observado ampliamente que la resistencia de las redes de sensores proviene del hecho de que varios nodos de sensores se pueden distribuir en un área relativamente grande para construir una red multihop. Este documento demuestra que se pueden construir importantes aplicaciones a gran escala utilizando sensores integrando juiciosamente las capacidades de almacenamiento, comunicación y cálculo de los sensores. El documento describe técnicas importantes para combinar la memoria, la transmisión y la potencia de la batería de muchos sensores para abordar las limitaciones de recursos en el contexto de una aplicación de búsqueda y rescate. Sin embargo, estas técnicas son bastante generales. Discutimos varias otras aplicaciones basadas en sensores que pueden emplear estas técnicas. Si bien CENWITS aborda el problema general de seguimiento de ubicaciones e informes en una red de área amplia, hay dos diferencias importantes con respecto al trabajo anterior realizado en esta área. Primero, a diferencia de las soluciones de seguimiento de ubicaciones anteriores, Cenwits no requiere una red conectada. En segundo lugar, a diferencia de las soluciones de seguimiento de ubicaciones anteriores, CenWits no apunta a una precisión muy alta de localización. En cambio, el objetivo principal es proporcionar un área aproximada y pequeña donde se puedan concentrarse los esfuerzos de búsqueda y rescate. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, generalizamos algunos de los proyectos y tecnologías recientes relacionadas con el seguimiento de movimiento y ubicación, y los sistemas de búsqueda y rescate. En la Sección 3, describimos la arquitectura general de Cenwits y proporcionamos una descripción de alto nivel de su funcionalidad. En la siguiente sección, Sección 4, discutimos la gestión de energía y memoria en Cenwits. Para simplificar nuestra presentación, nos centraremos en una aplicación específica del seguimiento de los excursionistas perdidos/lesionados en todas estas secciones. En la Sección 6, describimos una implementación prototipo de CENWITS y el rendimiento actual medido a partir de esta implementación. Discutimos cómo las ideas de CENWITS se pueden usar para construir varias otras aplicaciones en la Sección 7. Finalmente, en la Sección 8, discutimos algunos temas relacionados y concluimos el documento.2. Trabajo relacionado Se proporciona una encuesta de sistemas de ubicación para la informática ubicua en [11]. En [17] se propone un sistema de seguimiento de ubicación para las redes de sensores ADHOC que utiliza sensores de anclaje como referencia para obtener información de ubicación y extenderlo al nodo exterior [17]. La mayoría de los sistemas de seguimiento de ubicación en las redes de sensores ADHOC son para beneficiar el enrutamiento geográfico. No encajan bien para nuestros propósitos. El conocido sistema de insignias activas [19] permite a un usuario llevar una insignia. Un sensor infrarrojo en la habitación puede detectar la presencia de una insignia y determinar la ubicación y la identificación de la persona. Este es un sistema útil para el entorno interior, donde el GPS no funciona. La ubicación con dispositivos 802.11 es probablemente la solución más barata para el seguimiento de la posición interior [8]. Debido a la popularidad y al bajo costo de los dispositivos 802.11, se han desarrollado varias soluciones comerciales basadas en esta tecnología [1]. Un sistema que combina dos tecnologías maduras y es viable en el área suburbana donde un usuario puede ver el cielo transparente y tiene recepción celular GSM al mismo tiempo que está disponible actualmente [5]. Este sistema recibe una señal GPS de un satélite y se ubica, extrae la ubicación en un mapa y envía información de ubicación a través de la red GSM a las demás que están interesadas en la ubicación de los usuarios. Un sistema muy simple para monitorear a los niños consiste en un transmisor de RF y un receptor. El sistema alarma el titular del receptor cuando el transmisor está a punto de quedarse sin rango [6]. Las balizas de localización personal (PLB) se han utilizado para el rescate de avalancha durante años. Un esquiador lleva un transmisor de RF que emite balizas periódicamente, para que un equipo de rescate pueda encontrar su ubicación basada en la fuerza de la señal de RF. La versión de lujo de PLB combina un receptor GPS y un transmisor satelital CospasSarsat que puede transmitir la ubicación de los usuarios en latitud y longitud al equipo de rescate cada vez que ocurre un accidente [4]. Sin embargo, el dispositivo se enciende todo el tiempo, lo que resulta en un drenaje rápido de la batería, o debe activarse después del accidente para que funcione. Otra tecnología relacionada en uso generalizado hoy en día es el sistema OnStar [3], típicamente utilizado en varios automóviles de lujo. En este sistema, una unidad GPS proporciona información de posición, y un poderoso transmisor transmite esa información a través del satélite a un centro de servicio al cliente. Diseñado para emergencias, el usuario puede activar el sistema, ya sea con la presentación de un botón o por un accidente catastrófico. Una vez que se ha activado el sistema, un representante humano intenta obtener comunicación con el usuario a través de un teléfono celular construido como un dispositivo INCAR. Si no se puede hacer contacto, los servicios de emergencia se envían a la ubicación proporcionada por el GPS. Al igual que las PLB, este sistema tiene varias limitaciones. Primero, es pesado y costoso. Requiere un transmisor satelital y una red conectada. Si no se puede mantener la conectividad con la red GPS o un satélite de comunicación, el sistema falla. Desafortunadamente, estos son obstáculos comunes encontrados en cañones profundos, calles estrechas en grandes ciudades, estacionamientos y varios otros lugares.181 El sistema de vida utiliza la placa receptor GPS combinada con un transmisor GSM/GPRS y un transmisor de RF en un nodo del sensor inalámbrico llamado Unidad de Comunicación Inteligente (UCI). Una UCI primero intenta transmitir su ubicación a un centro de control a través de la red GSM/GPRS. Si eso falla, se conecta con otras ICUS (Network ADHOC) para reenviar su información de ubicación hasta que la información llegue a una UCI que tiene recepción GSM/GPRS. Esta UCI luego transmite la información de ubicación de la UCI original a través de la red GSM/GPRS. Zebranet es un sistema diseñado para estudiar los patrones móviles de las cebras [13]. Utiliza dos protocolos: protocolo basado en la historia y protocolo de inundación. El protocolo basado en la historia se usa cuando las cebras pasajan y no se mueven demasiado. Si bien esto podría ser útil para rastrear cebras, no es adecuado para rastrear a los excursionistas porque es más probable que dos excursionistas se encuentren solo una vez en un sendero. En el protocolo de inundación, un nodo arroja sus datos a un vecino cada vez que encuentra uno y no elimina su propia copia hasta que encuentre una estación base. Sin considerar los bucles de enrutamiento, el filtrado y la agrupación de paquetes, el tamaño de los datos en un nodo crecerá exponencialmente y drenará la potencia y la memoria de un nodo sensor en poco tiempo. En su lugar, Cenwits utiliza un protocolo de sacudida a mano de cuatro fases para garantizar que un nodo transmita solo tanta información como el otro nodo esté dispuesto a recibir. Si bien Zebranet está diseñado para un gran grupo de sensores que se mueven juntos en la misma dirección con la misma velocidad, Cenwits está diseñado para usarse en el escenario donde los sensores se mueven en diferentes direcciones a diferentes velocidades. Retraso La arquitectura de red tolerante aborda algunos problemas importantes en las redes desafiadas (limitadas por recursos) [9]. Si bien este trabajo se ocupa principalmente de la interoperabilidad de las redes desafiadas, algunos problemas relacionados con las redes conectadas ocasionalmente son similares a las que hemos abordado en CENWITS. Entre todos estos sistemas, Luxury PLB y Lifetch están diseñados para el seguimiento de la ubicación en áreas del desierto. Sin embargo, ambos sistemas requieren una red conectada. Luxury PLB requiere que el usuario transmita una señal a un satélite, mientras que Lifetch requiere conexión a la red GSM/GPRS. PLB de lujo transmite información de ubicación, solo cuando ocurre un accidente. Sin embargo, si el usuario está enterrado en la nieve o cae en un cañón profundo, casi no hay posibilidad de que la señal pase y se transmita al equipo de rescate. Esto se debe a que la transmisión satelital necesita línea de visión. Además, dado que no hay un historial conocido de la ubicación de los usuarios, no es posible que el equipo de rescate infiera la ubicación actual del usuario. Otra desventaja de Luxury PLB es que un transmisor satelital es muy costoso, y cuesta en el rango de $ 750. Lifetch intenta transmitir la información de ubicación por GSM/GPRS y ADHOC Sensor Network que utiliza AODV como protocolo de enrutamiento. Sin embargo, tener una recepción celular en áreas remotas en áreas silvestres, p. Los parques nacionales estadounidenses son poco probables. Además, es extremadamente poco probable que las UCI que usen los excursionistas puedan formar una red ADHOC en una gran área silvestre. Esto se debe a que los excursionistas son móviles y es muy poco probable que se coloquen varias UCI lo suficientemente densas como para reenviar paquetes incluso en una ruta de caminata muy popular. CENWITS está diseñado para abordar las limitaciones de sistemas como Luxury PLB y Lifetch. Está diseñado para proporcionar a los excursionistas, esquiadores y escaladores que tienen sus actividades principalmente en áreas silvestres una oportunidad mucho más alta de transmitir su información de ubicación a un centro de control. No depende de conectividad constante con ningún medio de comunicación. Más bien, comunica información a lo largo de un usuario a otro, y finalmente llega a un centro de control. A diferencia de varios de los sistemas discutidos hasta ahora, no requiere que una unidad de usuarios esté constantemente activada. De hecho, puede descubrir una ubicación de las víctimas, incluso si el sensor de víctimas estaba fuera en el momento del accidente y ha permanecido desde entonces. Cenwits resuelve uno de los mayores problemas que afectan a los sistemas modernos de búsqueda y rescate: tiene una capacidad de almacenamiento inherente en el sitio. Esto significa que alguien dentro de la red tendrá acceso a la última información de ubicación conocida de una víctima, y tal vez también su información sobre el rodamiento y la velocidad. Figura 1: el excursionista A y el excursionista B no están en el rango del otro 3. Cenwits describimos Cenwits en el contexto de la ubicación de excursionistas perdidos/lesionados en áreas silvestres. Cada excursionista usa un sensor (Mica2 Motes en nuestro prototipo) equipado con un receptor GPS y un transmisor de RF. A cada sensor se le asigna una ID única y mantiene su ubicación actual en función de la señal recibida por su receptor GPS. También emite balizas periódicamente. Cuando dos sensores están en el rango entre sí, registran la presencia entre sí (información de testigos), y también intercambian la información de los testigos que registraron anteriormente. La idea clave aquí es que si dos sensores vienen en el rango uno del otro en cualquier momento, se convierten en testigos de los demás. Más tarde, si se pierde el excursionista que usa uno de estos sensores, el otro sensor puede transmitir la última ubicación conocida (presenciada) del excursionista perdido. Además, al intercambiar la información del testigo que cada sensor registró anteriormente, la información de los testigos se propaga más allá de un contacto directo entre dos sensores. Para transmitir información de testigos a un centro de procesamiento o a un equipo de rescate, se establecen puntos de acceso en lugares bien conocidos por los que se espera que pasen los excursionistas, p.En los caminos de senderos, los extremos del sendero, la intersección de diferentes senderos, puntos de vista panorámicos, áreas de descanso, etc. Cada vez que un nodo del sensor está cerca de un punto de acceso, toda la información de los testigos almacenada en ese sensor se descarta automáticamente al punto de acceso. Los puntos de acceso están conectados a un centro de procesamiento a través de satélite o alguna otra red1. La información del testigo se descarga al centro de procesamiento desde varios puntos de acceso a intervalos regulares. En el caso de que se pierda la conexión a un punto de acceso, la información de eso 1 Una conexión solo se necesita entre los puntos de acceso y un centro de procesamiento. No hay necesidad de ninguna conexión entre diferentes puntos de acceso.182 El punto de acceso se puede descargar manualmente, p.por uavs. Para estimar la velocidad, la ubicación y la dirección de un excursionista en cualquier momento, se procesa toda la información de los testigos de ese excursionista que se ha recopilado desde varios puntos de acceso. Figura 2: Hiker A y Hiker B están en el rango del otro. A registra la presencia de B y B registra la presencia de A. A y B se convierten en testigos de los demás. Figura 3: El excursionista A está en el rango de un punto de acceso. Sube la información de su testigo grabado y borra su memoria. Un ejemplo de cómo opera Cenwits se ilustra en las Figuras 1, 2 y 3. Primero, los excursionistas A y B están en dos senderos cercanos, pero fuera del alcance del otro (Figura 1). Este es un escenario muy común durante una caminata. Por ejemplo, en una popular caminata de cuatro horas, un excursionista podría encontrarse con hasta otros 20 excursionistas. Esto representa un encuentro cada 12 minutos en promedio. Un excursionista lento puede ir 1 milla (5,280 pies) por hora. Así, en 12 minutos, un excursionista lento puede llegar hasta 1056 pies. Esto implica que si tuviéramos que colocar 20 excursionistas en una caminata de 4 horas y unidireccional de manera uniforme, el rango de cada nodo del sensor debe tener al menos 1056 pies para que se comuniquen entre sí continuamente. La intensidad de la señal comienza a caer rápidamente para que dos nodos de Mica2 se comuniquen entre sí cuando están a 180 pies de distancia, y se pierden por completo cuando están a 230 pies de distancia entre sí [7]. Entonces, para que los sensores formen una red de sensores en una ruta de senderismo de 4 horas, debería haber al menos 120 excursionistas dispersos uniformemente. Claramente, esto es extremadamente improbable. De hecho, en una ruta de senderismo menos popular de 4 horas, uno solo podría encontrarse con otros cinco excursionistas. Cenwits aprovecha el hecho de que los sensores pueden comunicarse entre sí y registrar su presencia. Dada una velocidad de caminar de una milla por hora (88 pies por minuto) y un rango de mica2 de aproximadamente 150 pies para la transmisión de radio sin línea de visión, dos excursionistas tienen aproximadamente 150/88 = 1.7 minutos para descubrir la presencia entre síe intercambiar su información de testigos. Por lo tanto, diseñamos nuestro sistema para que cada sensor emita un faro cada minuto y medio. En la Figura 2, el sensor BS de Hiker emite un faro cuando A está en el rango, esto desencadena A para intercambiar datos con B. A comunica la siguiente información a B: Mi identificación es A;Vi C a las 1:23 pm a (39◦ 49.3277655, 105◦ 39.1126776), vi E a las 3:09 pm a (40◦ 49.2234879, 105◦ 20.3290168). B Entonces responde con mi identificación es B;Vi K a las 11:20 am a las (39 ° 51.4531655, 105◦ 41.6776223). Además, los registros que vi B a las 4:17 pm a (41◦ 29.3177354, 105◦ 04.9106211) y B Records Vi A a las 4:17 pm a (41◦ 29.3177354, 105◦ 04.9106211). B se dirige a acampar durante la noche mientras se dirige a la cabeza del sendero donde hay un AP, que emite una baliza cada 5 segundos para evitar perderse a cualquier excursionista. Un testigo de la información que ha recopilado al punto de acceso. Esto se muestra en la Figura 3. 3.1 Información de los testigos: el almacenamiento Una preocupación crítica es que hay una cantidad limitada de memoria disponible en motas (memoria SDRAM de 4 kb, memoria flash de 128 kb y 4-512 kb EEPROM). Por lo tanto, es importante organizar la información de los testigos de manera eficiente. Cenwits almacena información de testigos en cada nodo como un conjunto de registros de testigos (el formato se muestra en la Figura 4. 1 B BOD ID Registro Tiempo de registro X, y Tiempo de ubicación Conteo de salto 1 B 3 B 8 B 3 B Figura 4: Formato de un registro de testigos. Cuando dos nodos I y J se encuentran entre sí, cada nodo genera un nuevo registro de testigos. En el registro de testigos generado por I, el ID de nodo es J, la hora de registro es la hora actual en el reloj, (x, y) son las coordenadas de la ubicación de I que grabé más recientemente (ya sea de satélite o LP),La hora de ubicación es el momento en que se registró esta ubicación, y el recuento de lúpulos es 0. A cada nodo se le asigna una ID de nodo única cuando ingresa a un sendero. En nuestro prototipo actual, hemos asignado un byte para la ID de nodo, aunque esto se puede aumentar a dos o más bytes si se espera que un gran número de excursionistas estén presentes al mismo tiempo. Podemos representar el tiempo en 17 bits a una segunda precisión. Por lo tanto, hemos asignado 3 bytes cada uno para tiempo de registro y tiempo de ubicación. La circunferencia de la Tierra es de aproximadamente 40.075 km. Si usamos un número de 32 bits para representar tanto longitud como latitud, la precisión que obtenemos es 40,075,000/232 = 0.0093 metros = 0.37 pulgadas, lo cual es bastante precisa para nuestras necesidades. Entonces, hemos asignado 4 bytes cada uno para coordenadas X e Y de la ubicación de un nodo. De hecho, se puede lograr una precisión de pie usando solo 27 bits.3.2 Punto de ubicación e inferencia de ubicación Aunque un receptor GPS proporciona una información de ubicación precisa, tiene su limitación. En cañones y bosques lluviosos, un receptor GPS no funciona. Cuando hay una gran cubierta en la nube, los usuarios de GPS también han experimentado inexactitud en la ubicación informada. Desafortunadamente, muchas rutas de senderismo están en bosques y cañones densos, y no es tan raro llover después de que los excursionistas comienzan a caminar. Para abordar esto, Cenwits incorpora la idea de los puntos de ubicación (LP). Un punto de ubicación puede actualizar un nodo del sensor con su ubicación actual siempre que el nodo esté cerca de ese LP. Los LP se colocan en diferentes ubicaciones en un área silvestre donde los receptores GPS no funcionan. Un LP es un dispositivo muy simple que emite información de ubicación previamente grabada en un intervalo de tiempo regular. Se puede colocar en lugares difíciles de alcanzar, como cañones profundos y densas bosques de la selva simplemente dejándolos de un avión. LPS permite que un nodo sensor determine su ubicación actual con mayor precisión. Sin embargo, no son 183 un requisito esencial de Cenwits. Si un LP se queda sin energía, los Cenwits continuarán funcionando correctamente. Figura 5: El receptor GPS no funciona correctamente. Luego, los sensores tienen que confiar en LP para proporcionar coordinación en la Figura 5, B no puede obtener la recepción GPS debido al mal tiempo. Luego se encuentra en un sendero que tampoco tiene recepción GPS. Sus sensores registran la presencia el uno del otro. Después de 10 minutos, A está en el alcance de un LP que proporciona una información de ubicación precisa a A. Cuando A regresa a la cabeza del sendero y carga sus datos (Figura 6), el sistema puede dibujar un círculo centrado en el LP desde el cual una información de ubicación obtenida para el rango de ubicación de encuentro de A y B. Al superponer este círculo con el mapa de senderos, se pueden inferir dos o tres ubicaciones posibles del encuentro. Por lo tanto, cuando se requiere un rescate, la posible ubicación de B puede inferirse mejor (ver Figuras 7 y 8). Figura 6: A ha vuelto a la cabeza del sendero, informa el momento del encuentro con B a AP, pero no hay información de ubicación para AP Figura 7: B todavía falta después del atardecer. Cenwits infiere el último punto de contacto y dibuja el círculo de posibles ubicaciones de corriente basadas en la velocidad de senderismo promedio, Cenwits requiere que los relojes de diferentes nodos de sensores se sincronizen libremente entre sí. Tal sincronización es trivial cuando la cobertura GPS está disponible. Además, los nodos sensores en CENWITS sincronizan sus relojes cada vez que están en el rango de un AP o un LP. La Figura 8: Basado en un paisaje superpuesto, B podría haber caminado a la rama equivocada y caído de un acantilado. Por lo tanto, las áreas de rescate en caliente pueden determinar la precisión de sincronización que las necesidades de CENWITS es del orden de un segundo más o menos. Mientras los relojes se sincronizen con en un segundo rango, si A Met B a las 12: 3745 o 12: 3746 no importa en el orden de los eventos de los testigos e inferir el camino.4. Memoria y gestión de energía CENWITS emplea varios mecanismos importantes para conservar la potencia y la memoria. Es importante tener en cuenta que mientras que los nodos sensores actuales tienen una cantidad limitada de memoria, se espera que los nodos sensores futuros tengan mucha más memoria. Con esto en mente, el enfoque principal en nuestro diseño es proporcionar una compensación entre la cantidad de memoria disponible y la cantidad de consumo de energía.4.1 Gestión de la memoria El tamaño de la información de los testigos almacenada en un nodo puede ser muy grande. Esto se debe a que el nodo puede encontrarse con varios otros nodos durante una caminata, y puede terminar acumulando una gran cantidad de información de testigos con el tiempo. Para abordar este problema, CenWits permite que un nodo libere de manera proactiva algunas partes de su memoria periódicamente. ¿Esto plantea una pregunta interesante de cuándo y qué registro de testigos debe eliminarse de la memoria de un nodo? CENWITS utiliza tres criterios para determinar esto: recuento de registros, recuento de lúpulos y brecha de registro. El recuento de registros se refiere al número de registros de testigos con la misma identificación de nodo que un nodo ha almacenado en su memoria. Un nodo mantiene un recuento de registros máximo del parámetro entero. Las tiendas en la mayoría de los registros de Max cuentan los registros de testigos de cualquier nodo. Cada registro de testigos tiene un campo de conteo de lúpulo que almacena los tiempos de número (lúpulo) Este registro se ha transferido desde que se creó. Inicialmente, este campo se establece en 0. Cada vez que un nodo recibe un registro de testigos de otro nodo, incrementa el recuento de lúpulo de ese registro en 1. Un nodo mantiene un parámetro entero llamado Max Hop Count. Mantiene solo esos registros de testigos en su memoria, cuyo recuento de lúpulo es menos que el recuento máximo de lúpulo. El parámetro de conteo máximo de lúpulo proporciona un equilibrio entre dos objetivos conflictivos: (1) para garantizar que un registro de testigos se haya propagado y, por lo tanto, almacenado en tantos nodos como sea posible, de modo que tenga una alta probabilidad de ser abandonado en algún AP AS ASlo mas rapido posible;y (2) para garantizar que un registro de testigos se almacene solo en unos pocos nodos, de modo que no obstruya demasiado la memoria combinada de todos los nodos sensores. Elegimos usar el recuento de lúpulo en lugar del tiempo de vida para decidir cuándo soltar un paquete. La razón principal de esto es que la probabilidad de que un paquete alcance un AP aumente a medida que el recuento de saltos se suma. Por ejemplo, cuando el lúpulo cuenta si 5 para un registro específico, 184 el registro está en al menos 5 nodos de sensores. Por otro lado, si descartamos los registros antiguos, sin considerar el recuento de lúpulos, no hay garantía de que el registro esté presente en cualquier otro nodo del sensor. La brecha de registro se refiere a la diferencia horaria entre los tiempos de registro de dos registros de testigos con la misma identificación del nodo. Para guardar la memoria, un nodo N asegura que la brecha de registro entre dos registros de testigos con la misma ID de nodo sea al menos mínimo de brecha de registro. Para cada identificación del nodo i, N almacena el registro del testigo con el tiempo récord más reciente RTI, el testigo con el tiempo récord más reciente que es al menos un mínimo de unidades de tiempo de brecha récord antes de RTI, y así) es alcanzado. Cuando un nodo está apretado en la memoria, ajusta los tres parámetros, el recuento de registros máximos, el recuento máximo de lúpulo y la brecha de registro MIN para liberar algo de memoria. Disminuye el recuento de registros máximos y el recuento máximo de lúpulo, y los incrementos mínimos brecha de registro. Luego primero borra todos los registros de testigos cuyo recuento de lúpulo excede el valor reducido del conteo de lúpulo máximo, y luego borra los registros de testigos para satisfacer los criterios de brecha de registro. Además, cuando un nodo tiene espacio de memoria adicional disponible, p.Después de descargar su información de testigos en un punto de acceso, restablece el recuento de registros máximos, el recuento máximo de lúpulo y la brecha de registro MIN a algunos valores predefinidos.4.2 Gestión de energía Una ventaja importante del uso de sensores para fines de seguimiento es que podemos regular el comportamiento de un nodo sensor en función de las condiciones actuales. Por ejemplo, mencionamos anteriormente que un sensor debe emitir un faro cada 1.7 minutos, dada una velocidad de senderismo de 1 milla/hora. Sin embargo, si un usuario se mueve 10 pies/seg, se debe emitir un faro cada 10 segundos. Si un usuario no se mueve en absoluto, se puede emitir una baliza cada 10 minutos. En la noche, un sensor se puede poner en modo de suspensión para ahorrar energía, cuando no es probable que un usuario se mueva durante un período de tiempo relativamente más largo. Si un usuario está activo durante solo ocho horas en un día, podemos poner el sensor en modo de suspensión durante las otras 16 horas y, por lo tanto, ahorrar 2/3 de la energía. Además, un nodo del sensor puede optar por no enviar balizas durante algunos intervalos de tiempo. Por ejemplo, suponga que Hiker A ha comunicado su información de testigos a otros tres excursionistas en los últimos cinco minutos. Si se está ejecutando con poca potencia, puede ir al modo de recibir o modo de suspensión durante los próximos diez minutos. Va al modo de recibir si aún está dispuesto a recibir información adicional de testigos de los excursionistas que encuentra en los próximos diez minutos. Va al modo de suspensión si es extremadamente bajo en potencia. El ancho de banda y las limitaciones de energía de los nodos sensores requieren que la cantidad de datos transferidos entre los nodos se reduzca al mínimo. Se ha observado que en algunos escenarios se podrían ejecutar 3000 instrucciones para el mismo costo de energía de enviar un poco de 100 m por radio [15]. Para reducir la cantidad de transferencia de datos, Cenwits emplea un protocolo de apretón de manos que ejecutan dos nodos cuando se encuentran entre sí. El objetivo de este protocolo es garantizar que un nodo transmita solo tanta información de testigos como el otro nodo está dispuesto a recibir. Este protocolo se inicia cuando un nodo I recibe una baliza que contiene la ID del nodo del nodo del remitente J y yo no ha intercambiado información de testigos con J en las últimas unidades de tiempo de δ. Suponga que yo <j. El protocolo consta de cuatro fases (ver Figura 9): 1. Fase I: Nodo I envía sus limitaciones de recibir y el número de registros de testigos que tiene en su memoria.2. Fase II: Al recibir este mensaje de I, J envía sus limitaciones de recibir y el número de registros de testigos que tiene en su memoria.3. Fase III: Al recibir el mensaje anterior de J, envía su información de testigos (filtrada en función de las restricciones de recepción recibidas en la Fase II).4. Fase IV: Después de recibir los registros de testigos de I, J envía su información de testigos (filtrada en función de las restricciones de recepción recibidas en la Fase I).J <Constaints, Tamaño de información de testigo> <Constaints, Tamaño de información de testigo> <Información de testigos filtrado> <Información de testigos filtrados> I J J J I I I Figura 9: Protocolo de sacudida de manos de cuatro fases (i <j) Las limitaciones de recibir son una función de la memoria y la potencia. En el caso más general, están compuestos por los tres parámetros (recuento de registros, recuento de lúpulos y brecha de registro) utilizados para la gestión de la memoria. Si tengo poca memoria, especifica el número máximo de registros que está dispuesto a aceptar de j. Del mismo modo, puedo pedirle a J que envíe solo aquellos registros que tienen un valor de conteo de lúpulo menor que el recuento máximo de lúpulo - 1. Finalmente, puedo incluir su valor de brecha de registro MIN en sus restricciones de recepción. Tenga en cuenta que el protocolo de apretón de manos es beneficioso tanto para I como para J. Guarden la memoria al recibir tanta información como están dispuestos a aceptar y conservar energía enviando solo tantos registros de testigos como sea necesario. Resulta que filtrar registros de testigos basados en MIN Record Gap es complejo. Requiere que los registros de testigos de cualquier nodo dado se organicen en un orden ordenado por sus valores de tiempo de registro. Mantener este orden ordenado es complejo en la memoria, porque los nuevos registros de testigos con la misma ID de nodo pueden llegar más tarde que pueden insertarse en el medio para preservar el orden ordenado. Por esta razón, las restricciones de recepción en el prototipo actual de CENWITS no incluyen la brecha de registro. Supongamos que especifica un valor de conteo de lúpulo de 3. En este caso, J verifica el campo de conteo de lúpulo de cada registro de testigos antes de enviarlos. Si el valor de conteo de salto es mayor que 3, el registro no se transmite.4.3 Grupos y particiones Para reducir aún más la comunicación y aumentar la vida útil de nuestro sistema, presentamos la noción de grupos. La idea se basa en el concepto de regiones abstractas presentadas en [20]. Un grupo es un conjunto de N nodos que se pueden definir en términos de conectividad de radio, ubicación geográfica u otras propiedades de los nodos. Todos los nodos dentro de un grupo pueden comunicarse directamente entre sí y comparten información para mantener su visión del mundo externo. En cualquier momento, un grupo tiene exactamente un líder que comunica 185 con nodos externos en nombre de todo el grupo. Un grupo puede ser estático, lo que significa que la membresía del grupo no cambia durante el período de tiempo, o podría ser dinámico en qué caso los nodos pueden salir o unirse al grupo. Para simplificar nuestro análisis y explicar las ventajas del grupo, primero discutimos grupos estáticos. Se forma un grupo estático al comienzo de una ruta de senderismo o pendiente de esquí. Supongamos que hay cinco miembros de la familia que quieren ir a una caminata en el Parque Nacional Rocky Mountain. Antes de que estos miembros comiencen su caminata, a cada uno de ellos recibe un nodo del sensor y la información se ingresa en el sistema de que los cinco nodos forman un grupo. Cada miembro del grupo recibe una identificación única y cada miembro del grupo sabe sobre otros miembros del grupo. Al grupo, en su conjunto, también se le asigna una ID para distinguirlo de otros grupos en el sistema. Figura 10: Un grupo de cinco personas. El nodo 2 es el líder del grupo y se comunica en nombre del grupo con un nodo externo 17. Todos los demás (que se muestran en un tono más ligero) están en modo de suspensión. A medida que el grupo se mueve por el sendero, intercambia información con otros nodos o grupos que se encuentra. En cualquier momento, solo un miembro del grupo, llamado líder, envía y recibe información en nombre del grupo y todos los demás miembros del grupo N - 1 se colocan en el modo de suspensión (ver Figura 10). Es esta propiedad de los grupos la que nos ahorra energía. El liderazgo del grupo es multiplexado por el tiempo entre los miembros del grupo. Esto se hace para asegurarse de que un solo nodo no se quede sin batería debido al intercambio continuo de información. Por lo tanto, después de cada segundo lugar, el liderazgo se transmite a otro nodo, llamado sucesor, y el líder (ahora un miembro ordinario) se pone a dormir. Como la energía es querida, no implementamos un extenso algoritmo electoral para elegir al sucesor. En cambio, elegimos el sucesor sobre la base de la identificación del nodo. El nodo con la siguiente identificación más alta del grupo se elige como sucesor. El último nodo, por supuesto, elige el nodo con la identificación más baja como sucesor. Ahora discutimos los esquemas de almacenamiento de datos para grupos. La memoria es un recurso escaso en los nodos de sensores y, por lo tanto, es importante que la información de los testigos se almacene de manera eficiente entre los miembros del grupo. El almacenamiento de datos eficiente no es una tarea trivial cuando se trata de grupos. La compensación es entre la simplicidad del esquema y el ahorro de memoria. Un esquema más simple incurre en un costo de energía menor en comparación con un esquema más sofisticado, pero también ofrece un ahorro de memoria menor. Esto se debe a que en un esquema más complicado, los miembros del grupo tienen que coordinar para actualizar y almacenar información. Después de considerar varios esquemas diferentes, hemos llegado a una conclusión de que no existe un esquema de almacenamiento óptimo para los grupos. El sistema debería poder adaptarse de acuerdo con sus requisitos. Si los miembros del grupo tienen poca batería, entonces el grupo puede adaptar un esquema que sea más eficiente energéticamente. Del mismo modo, si los miembros del grupo se están quedando sin memoria, pueden adaptar un esquema que sea más eficiente en la memoria. Primero presentamos un esquema simple que es muy eficiente en energía pero que no ofrece ahorros de memoria significativos. Luego presentamos un esquema alternativo que es mucho más eficiente en la memoria. Como ya se mencionó, un grupo solo puede recibir información a través del líder del grupo. Cada vez que el líder se encuentra con un nodo E externo E, recibe información de ese nodo y la guarda. En nuestro primer esquema, cuando expira el intervalo de tiempo para el líder, el líder aprueba esta nueva información que recibió de E a su sucesor. Esto es importante porque durante el próximo espacio de tiempo, si el nuevo líder se encuentra con otro nodo externo, debería poder pasar información sobre todos los nodos externos que este grupo ha presenciado hasta ahora. Por lo tanto, la información se replica completamente en todos los nodos para mantener la visión correcta del mundo. Nuestro primer esquema no ofrece ningún ahorro de memoria, pero es muy eficiente en energía y puede ser una buena opción cuando los miembros del grupo se están quedando sin batería. Excepto por el momento en que se cambia el liderazgo, todos los miembros N - 1 están dormidos en un momento dado. Esto significa que un solo miembro está hasta los segundos una vez cada n ∗ t segundos y, por lo tanto, tiene que gastar aproximadamente 1/nth de su energía. Por lo tanto, si hay 5 miembros en un grupo, ahorramos 80% de energía, lo cual es enorme. Se puede ahorrar más energía aumentando el tamaño del grupo. Ahora presentamos un esquema de almacenamiento de datos alternativo que tiene como objetivo ahorrar memoria a costa de energía. En este esquema dividimos al grupo en lo que llamamos particiones. Las particiones pueden considerarse subgrupos dentro de un grupo. Cada partición debe tener al menos dos nodos. Los nodos dentro de una partición se llaman pares. Cada partición tiene un par designado como líder de partición. El líder de la partición permanece en modo de recepción en todo momento, mientras que todos los otros compañeros se mantienen en el modo de suspensión. El liderazgo de partición es multiplexado por el tiempo entre los pares para asegurarse de que un solo nodo no se quede sin batería. Como antes, un grupo tiene exactamente un líder y el liderazgo es multiplexado por el tiempo entre las particiones. El líder del grupo también sirve como líder de partición para la partición a la que pertenece (ver Figura 11). En este esquema, todos los líderes de partición participan en el intercambio de información. Cada vez que un grupo se encuentra con un nodo E externo, cada líder de partición recibe toda la información de los testigos, pero solo almacena un subconjunto de esa información después del filtrado. La información se filtra de tal manera que cada líder de partición tiene que almacenar solo bytes de datos B/K, donde K es el número de particiones y B es el número total de bytes recibidos de E.Del mismo modo, cuando un grupo quiere enviar información de testigos a E, cada líder de la partición envía solo bytes B/K que se almacenan en la partición a la que pertenece. Sin embargo, antes de que un líder de partición pueda enviar información, debe cambiar del modo de recepción al modo de envío. Además, los líderes de partición deben coordinarse entre sí para asegurarse de que no envíen su información de testigos al mismo tiempo, es decir, su mensaje no chocan. Todo esto se logra haciendo que el líder del grupo envíe una señal a cada líder de partición a su vez.186 Figura 11: La figura muestra un grupo de ocho nodos divididos en cuatro particiones de 2 nodos cada uno. El nodo 1 es el líder del grupo, mientras que los nodos 2, 9 y 7 son líderes de partición. Todos los demás nodos están en el modo de suspensión. Dado que el liderazgo de la partición es multiplexado en el tiempo, es importante que cualquier información recibida por el líder de la partición, P1, se transfiera al próximo líder, P2. Esto debe hacerse para asegurarse de que P2 tenga toda la información que pueda necesitar enviar cuando se encuentra con otro nodo externo durante su intervalo de tiempo. Una forma de lograr esto es despertar P2 justo antes de que expire el horario de P1 y luego tener información de transferencia P1 solo a P2. Una alternativa es despertar a todos los compañeros en el momento del cambio de liderazgo, y luego hacer que P1 transmitiera la información a todos los compañeros. Cada par guía la información enviada por P1 y luego vuelve a dormir. En ambos casos, los pares envían reconocimiento al líder de la partición después de recibir la información. En el método anterior, solo un nodo necesita despertarse en el momento del cambio de liderazgo, pero la cantidad de información que debe transmitirse entre los nodos aumenta a medida que pasa el tiempo. En el último caso, todos los nodos deben ser despertados en el momento del cambio de liderazgo, pero se debe transmitir una pequeña información cada vez entre los pares. Dado que la comunicación es mucho más costosa que traer los nodos, preferimos el segundo método sobre el primero. Un grupo se puede dividir en particiones de más de una forma. Por ejemplo, supongamos que tenemos un grupo de seis miembros. Podemos dividir este grupo en tres particiones de dos pares cada uno, o dos particiones con tres pares cada uno. La elección una vez más depende de los requisitos del sistema. Algunas particiones grandes harán que el sistema sea más eficiente energéticamente. Esto se debe a que en esta configuración, una mayor cantidad de nodos permanecerán en modo de suspensión en cualquier momento dado. Por otro lado, varias particiones pequeñas harán que la memoria del sistema sea eficiente, ya que cada nodo tendrá que almacenar información menor (ver Figura 12). Un grupo que se divide en particiones debe ser capaz de reajustarse cuando un nodo salga o se queda sin batería. Esto es crucial porque una partición debe tener al menos dos nodos en cualquier momento para tolerar la falla de un nodo. Por ejemplo, en la Figura 3 (a), si el nodo 2 o el nodo 5 muere, la partición se deja con solo un nodo. Más tarde, si ese solo nodo en la partición muere, toda la información de los testigos almacenada en esa partición se perderá. Hemos ideado un protocolo muy simple para resolver este problema. Primero explicamos cómo Partifigura 12: la figura muestra dos formas diferentes de dividir un grupo de seis nodos. En (a), un grupo se divide en tres particiones de dos nodos. El nodo 1 es el líder del grupo, los nodos 9 y 5 son líderes de partición, y los nodos 2, 3 y 6 están en modo de suspensión. En (b) el grupo se divide en dos particiones de tres nodos. El nodo 1 es el líder del grupo, el nodo 9 es el líder de la partición y los nodos 2, 3, 5 y 6 están en modo de suspensión.Las ciones se ajustan cuando un compañero muere y luego explica qué sucede si un líder de partición muere. Supongamos que el nodo 2 en la Figura 3 (a) muere. Cuando el nodo 5, el líder de la partición, envía información al nodo 2, no recibe un reconocimiento y concluye que el nodo 2 ha muerto2. En este punto, el nodo 5 contacta a otros líderes de partición (nodos 1 ... 9) usando un mensaje de transmisión y les informa que uno de sus compañeros ha muerto. Al escuchar esto, cada líder de la partición informa el nodo 5 (i) el número de nodos en su partición, (ii) un nodo candidato que el nodo 5 puede tomar si el número de nodos en su partición es mayor que 2 y (iii) elCantidad de información de testigos almacenada en su partición. Al escuchar a todos los líderes, el nodo 5 elige el nodo candidato de la partición con un número máximo (debe ser mayor que 2) de sus compañeros, y envía un mensaje a todos los líderes. El nodo 5 luego envía datos a su nuevo par para asegurarse de que la información se replica dentro de la partición. Sin embargo, si todas las particiones tienen exactamente dos nodos, entonces el nodo 5 debe unirse a otra partición. Elige la partición que tiene la menor cantidad de información de testigos para unirse. Envía su información de testigos al nuevo líder de partición. La información de los testigos y la actualización de la membresía se propagan a todos los pares durante el siguiente cambio de liderazgo de partición. Ahora consideramos el caso en el que muere el líder de la partición. Si esto sucede, entonces esperamos a que el liderazgo de la partición cambie y que el nuevo líder de la partición finalmente descubra que un compañero ha muerto. Una vez que el nuevo líder de la partición descubre que necesita más compañeros, procede con el protocolo explicado anteriormente. Sin embargo, en este caso, perdemos información que el líder de la partición anterior podría haber recibido justo antes de morir. Este problema se puede resolver implementando un protocolo más riguroso, pero hemos decidido renunciar a la precisión para ahorrar energía. Nuestro diseño actual utiliza la multiplexación de división de tiempo para programar modos de despertar y dormir en los nodos del sensor. Sin embargo, el trabajo reciente en los sensores de activación de radio [10] se puede usar para hacer esta programación de manera más eficiente.Planeamos incorporar sensores de despido de radio en Cenwits cuando el hardware es maduro.2 El algoritmo para concluir que un nodo ha muerto puede hacerse más riguroso al hacer que el líder de la partición consulte el nodo sospechoso varias veces.187 5. Evaluación del sistema Un sensor está limitado en la cantidad de memoria y potencia. En general, la cantidad de memoria necesaria y el consumo de energía depende de una variedad de factores, como la densidad de nodo, el número de encuentros de excursionistas y el número de puntos de acceso. En esta sección, proporcionamos una estimación de cuánto tiempo durará el poder de una mota de Mica2 bajo ciertas supuestas. Primero, suponemos que cada nodo del sensor lleva alrededor de 100 registros de testigos. Al encontrarse con otro excursionista, un nodo del sensor transmite 50 registros de testigos y recibe 50 nuevos registros de testigos. Dado que cada registro tiene 16 bytes de largo, tomará 0.34 segundos transmitir 50 registros y otros 0.34 segundos para recibir 50 registros en un enlace de 19200 BPS. El consumo de energía de Mica2 debido al procesamiento, transmisión y recepción de la CPU es de aproximadamente 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA y 8.5 mA por hora respectivamente [18], y la capacidad de una batería alcalina es de 2500 mAh. Dado que el módulo de radio de Mica2 es medio dúplex y supone que la CPU siempre está activa cuando un nodo está despierto, el consumo de energía debido a la transmisión es 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA por hora y debido a la recepción es 8 + 7 = 15 mA por hora. Por lo tanto, el consumo promedio de energía debido a la transmisión y la recepción es (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 mA por hora. Dado que la capacidad de una batería alcalina es de 2500 mAh, una batería debe durar 2500/15.75 = 159 horas de transmisión y recepción. Un encuentro entre dos excursionistas resulta a cambio de unos 50 registros de testigos que tarda aproximadamente 0.68 segundos como se calcula anteriormente. Por lo tanto, una sola batería alcalina puede durar (159 ∗ 60 ∗ 60) /0.68 = 841764 Encuentros de excursionistas. Suponiendo que un nodo emite una baliza cada 90 segundos y un encuentro de excursionistas ocurre cada vez que se emite un faro (peor de los casos), una sola batería alcalina durará (841764 ∗ 90)/(30 ∗ 24 ∗ 60 ∗ 60) = =29 días. Dado que un Mica2 está equipado con dos baterías, un sensor de Mica2 puede permanecer en funcionamiento durante aproximadamente dos meses. Observe que este cálculo es preliminar, porque supone que los excursionistas están activos las 24 horas del día y se produce un encuentro de excursionistas cada 90 segundos. En un escenario más realista, se espera que el poder dure un período de tiempo mucho más largo. Además, este período de tiempo aumentará significativamente cuando los grupos de excursionistas se muevan juntos. Finalmente, la vida útil de un sensor que se ejecuta en dos baterías definitivamente se puede aumentar significativamente mediante el uso de técnicas de eliminación de energía y técnicas de recolección de energía [16, 14].6. Implementación de prototipo Hemos implementado un prototipo de CENWITS en el sensor de mica2 900MHz que ejecuta Mantis OS 0.9.1b. Uno de los sensores está equipado con el módulo GPS MTS420CA, que es capaz de presión barométrica y detección de aceleración de dos ejes, además del seguimiento de ubicación GPS. Utilizamos SIRF, el protocolo de comunicación en serie, para controlar el módulo GPS. Sirf tiene un rico conjunto de comandos, pero solo registramos coordenadas X e Y. Un registro de testigos tiene 16 bytes de largo. Cuando se inicia un nodo, almacena su ubicación actual y emite una baliza periódicamente en el prototipo, un nodo emite un faro cada minuto. Hemos realizado una serie de experimentos con este prototipo. Un informe detallado sobre estos experimentos con los datos sin procesar recopilados y fotografías de excursionistas, puntos de acceso, etc. está disponible en http://csel.cs.colorado.edu/∼huangjh/ cenwits.index.htm. Aquí informamos los resultados de tres de ellos. En todos estos experimentos, hay tres puntos de acceso (A, B y C) donde los nodos arrojan su información de testigos. Estos puntos de acceso también proporcionan información de ubicación a los nodos que vienen en su rango. Primero mostramos cómo se puede usar Cenwits para determinar la ruta de senderismo que un excursionista es muy probable y la velocidad a la que está caminando, e identificar áreas de búsqueda en caliente en caso de que se lo reporta que desaparece. A continuación, mostramos los resultados de las técnicas de gestión de potencia y memoria de CENWITS para conservar la potencia y la memoria de un nodo sensor en uno de nuestros experimentos.6.1 Localización de excursionistas perdidos El primer experimento se llama contacto directo. Es un experimento muy simple en el que un solo excursionista comienza desde A, va a B y luego a C, y finalmente regresa a A (ver Figura 13). El objetivo de este experimento es ilustrar que Cenwits puede deducir el sendero que toma un excursionista procesando la información de los testigos. Figura 13: Registro de ID del nodo del experimento de contacto directo (x, y) Ubicación Tiempo de tiempo HOP Recuento 1 15 (12,7) 15 0 1 33 (31,17) 33 0 1 46 (12,23) 46 0 1 10 (12 (12, 7) 10 0 1 48 (12,23) 48 0 1 16 (12,7) 16 0 1 34 (31,17) 34 0 Tabla 1: Información de testigos recopilada en el experimento de contacto directo. La información del testigo arrojada en los tres puntos de acceso fue recopilada y procesada en un centro de control. Parte de la información del testigo recopilada en el centro de control se muestra en la Tabla 1. Las ubicaciones x, y en esta tabla corresponden a la información de ubicación proporcionada por los puntos de acceso A, B y C. A se encuentra en (12,7), B se encuentra en (31,17) y C se encuentra en (12, 23). Tres puntos de encuentro (entre el excursionista 1 y los tres puntos de acceso) extraídos de 188 Esta información de testigos se muestra en la Figura 13 (que se muestra en cajas rectangulares). Por ejemplo, A, 1 a 16 significa que 1 entró en contacto con A en el tiempo 16. Usando esta información, podemos inferir la dirección en la que el excursionista 1 se estaba moviendo y la velocidad en la que se estaba moviendo. Además, dado un mapa de senderos de senderismo en esta área, es claramente posible identificar la ruta de senderismo que tomó el excursionista 1. El segundo experimento se llama inferencia indirecta. Este experimento está diseñado para ilustrar que Cenwits puede inferir la ubicación, la dirección y la velocidad de un excursionista, incluso si el excursionista nunca viene en el rango de ningún punto de acceso. Ilustra la importancia de la información de los testigos en las aplicaciones de búsqueda y rescate. En este experimento, hay tres excursionistas, 1, 2 y 3. Hiker 1 toma un sendero que va a lo largo de los puntos de acceso A y B, mientras que Hiker 3 toma un sendero que avanza los puntos de acceso C y B. Hiker 2 toma un sendero que no viene en el rango de ningún punto de acceso. Sin embargo, este excursionista se encuentra con el excursionista 1 y 3 durante su caminata. Esto se ilustra en la Figura 14. Figura 14: Registro de ID de nodo de experimento de inferencia indirecta (x, y) Ubicación Tiempo de tiempo HORO Recuento 2 16 (12,7) 6 0 2 15 (12,7) 6 0 1 4 (12,7) 4 0 1 6 (12 (12, 7) 6 0 1 29 (31,17) 29 0 1 31 (31,17) 31 0 Tabla 2: Información de testigos recopilada de Hiker 1 en el experimento de inferencia indirecta. Parte de la información del testigo recopilada en el centro de control de los puntos de acceso A, B y C se muestra en las Tablas 2 y 3. Hay algunos datos interesantes en estas tablas. Por ejemplo, el tiempo de ubicación en algunos registros de testigos no es lo mismo que el tiempo de registro. Esto significa que el nodo que generó ese registro no tenía su ubicación más actualizada en el momento del encuentro. Por ejemplo, cuando los excursionistas 1 y 2 se reúnen en el tiempo 16, el último tiempo de ubicación registrada del registro de ID de nodo (x, y) ubicación de tiempo de hop -tiempo recuento 3 78 (12,23) 78 0 3 107 (31,17) 107 03 106 (31,17) 106 0 3 76 (12,23) 76 0 3 79 (12,23) 79 0 2 94 (12,23) 79 0 1 16 (?,?)?1 1 15 (?,?)?1 Tabla 3: Información de testigos recopilada de Hiker 3 en el experimento de inferencia indirecta.Hiker 1 está (12,7) registrado en el momento 6. Entonces, el nodo 1 genera un registro de testigos con el tiempo de registro 16, la ubicación (12,7) y la hora de ubicación 6. De hecho, los dos últimos registros en la Tabla 3 tienen (?,?) Como su ubicación. Esto ha sucedido porque estos registros de testigos fueron generados por Hiker 2 durante su encuentro con 1 en el tiempo 15 y 16. Hasta este momento, Hiker 2 no había entrado en contacto con ningún punto de ubicación. Curiosamente, una información de ubicación más precisa del encuentro 1 y 2 o 2 y 3 encuentros se puede calcular mediante el proceso de la información de los testigos en el centro de control. Hiker 1 tardó 25 unidades en pasar de A (12,7) a B (31,17). Suponiendo una velocidad de senderismo constante y una caminata relativamente recta, se puede calcular que en el momento 16, el excursionista 1 debe haber estado en la ubicación (18,10). Así (18,10) es una ubicación más precisa del encuentro entre 1 y 2. Finalmente, nuestro tercer experimento llamado identificación de áreas de búsqueda en caliente está diseñada para determinar el sendero que un excursionista ha tomado e identificando áreas de búsqueda en caliente para rescate después de que se informa que desaparece. Hay seis excursionistas (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 y 6) en este experimento. La Figura 15 muestra los senderos que tomaron los excursionistas 1, 2, 3, 4 y 5, junto con los puntos de encuentro obtenidos de los registros de testigos recopilados en el centro de control. Para la brevedad, no hemos mostrado toda la información del testigo recopilada en el centro de control. Esta información está disponible en http://csel.cs.colorado.edu/∼huangjh/cenwits/index.htm. Figura 15: Identificación del experimento del área de búsqueda en caliente (sin excursionista 6) 189 Ahora suponga que el excursionista 6 se informa que falta en el momento 260. Para determinar las áreas de búsqueda en caliente, los registros de testigos de Hiker 6 se procesan para determinar el sendero en el que es más probable, la velocidad a la que se había estado moviendo, dirección en la que se había movido y su última ubicación conocida. Basado en esta información y en el mapa de senderismo, se identifican áreas de búsqueda en caliente. La ruta de senderismo tomada por Hiker 6 como se infiere por Cenwits se muestra mediante una línea punteada y las áreas de búsqueda en caliente identificadas por Cenwits se muestran mediante líneas oscuras dentro del círculo punteado en la Figura 16. Figura 16: Identificar el experimento del área de búsqueda en caliente (con el excursionista 6) 6.2 Resultados de la gestión de potencia y memoria La información del testigo que se muestra en las Tablas 1, 2 y 3 no se ha filtrado utilizando los tres criterios descritos en la Sección 4.1. Por ejemplo, los registros de testigos generados por 3 en los tiempos de registro 76, 78 y 79 (ver Tabla 3) se han generado debido a un solo contacto entre el punto de acceso C y el nodo 3. Al aplicar los criterios de brecha de registro, se borrarán dos de estos tres registros. Del mismo modo, los registros de testigos generados por 1 en los tiempos de registro 10, 15 y 16 (ver Tabla 1) se han generado debido a un solo contacto entre el punto de acceso A y el nodo 1. Nuevamente, al aplicar los criterios de brecha de registro, se borrarán dos de estos tres registros. Nuestros experimentos no generaron suficientes datos para probar el impacto del recuento de registros o los criterios de conteo de lúpulo. Para evaluar el impacto de estos criterios, simulamos CENWITS para generar una cantidad significativamente grande de registros para un número dado de excursionistas y puntos de acceso. Generamos registros de testigos haciendo que los excursionistas caminaran al azar. Aplicamos los tres criterios para medir la cantidad de ahorro de memoria en un nodo sensor. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 4. El número de excursionistas en esta simulación fue de 10 y el número de puntos de acceso fue 5. El número de registros de testigos reportados en esta tabla es un número promedio de registros de testigos un nodo sensor almacenado en el momento del volcado a un punto de acceso. Estos resultados muestran que los tres criterios de gestión de memoria reducen significativamente el consumo de memoria de los nodos sensores en CENWITS. Por ejemplo, pueden reducir el máximo mínimo max # de registro registro de registro de testimonio de testimonio de testimonio de la brecha registros 5 5 5 628 4 5 5 421 3 5 5 316 5 10 5 311 5 20 5 207 5 5 4 462 5 5 3 341 3 20 3 3 3 3 3 3161 Tabla 4: Impacto de las técnicas de gestión de memoria.El consumo de memoria hasta en un 75%. Sin embargo, estos resultados son prematuros en la actualidad por dos razones: (1) se generan mediante la simulación de excursionistas que caminan al azar;y (2) no está claro qué impacto tiene el borde de los registros de testigos en la precisión de la ubicación inferida/áreas de búsqueda en caliente de los excursionistas perdidos. En nuestro trabajo futuro, planeamos realizar un estudio importante para abordar estas dos preocupaciones.7. Otras aplicaciones además de la caminata en áreas silvestres, CENWITS se pueden usar en varias otras aplicaciones, p.Esquí, escalada, monitoreo de la vida salvaje y seguimiento de personas. Dado que Cenwits se basa solo en la conectividad intermitente, puede aprovechar las tecnologías baratas y maduras existentes y, por lo tanto, hacer que el seguimiento sea más barato y bastante preciso. Dado que Cenwits no depende de realizar un seguimiento de un titular de sensor todo el tiempo, pero se basa en mantener testigos, el sistema es relativamente más barato y ampliamente aplicable. Por ejemplo, hay algunos acantilados peligrosos en la mayoría de las estaciones de esquí. Pero es demasiado costoso para una estación de esquí desplegar una red de sensores inalámbricos conectados a través de la montaña. Usando Cenwits, podemos implementar algunos sensores en los límites del acantilado. Estos sensores límite emiten balizas con bastante frecuencia, p.Cada segundo, y así puede registrar la presencia de esquiadores que cruzan el límite y se caen del acantilado. Las patrullas de esquí pueden navegar por las montañas cada hora y consultar automáticamente el sensor de límite cuando están en el rango usando PDA. Si un PDA muestra que un esquiador ha estado cerca del sensor de límites, la Patrulla de esquí puede usar un Walkie-Talkie de largo alcance para consultar el Centro de control en la base del resort para verificar el registro de testigos del esquiador. Si no hay un registro de testigos después del tiempo registrado en el sensor de límite, existe una gran posibilidad de que se necesite un rescate. En el monitoreo de la vida silvestre, un método muy popular es unir un receptor GPS a los animales. Para recopilar datos, se usa un transmisor satelital o el recopilador de datos tiene que esperar hasta que se caiga la abrazadera del receptor GPS (después de un año más o menos) y luego buscar el receptor GPS. Los transmisores GPS son muy caros, p.El utilizado en el seguimiento de gansos es de $ 3,000 cada uno [2]. Además, aún no se sabe si la señal de radio continua es perjudicial para las aves. Además, un transmisor GPS es bastante voluminoso e incómodo, y como resultado, las aves siempre intentan deshacerse de él. Usando Cenwits, no solo podemos registrar la presencia de vida silvestre, sino que también podemos registrar el comportamiento de los animales salvajes, p.Los leones pueden seguir la migración de los ciervos. Cenwits ni requiere transmisores satelitales voluminosos y caros, ni es necesario esperar un año y buscar los aparatos ortopédicos. Cenwits proporciona una solución muy simple y rentable en este caso. Además, los puntos de acceso 190 pueden ubicarse estratégicamente, p.Cerca de una fuente de agua, para aumentar las posibilidades de recopilar datos actualizados. De hecho, los puntos de acceso no necesitan ser ubicados estáticamente. Se pueden colocar en un plano de baja altitud (por ejemplo, un UAV) y ser trasladados sobre un área silvestre para recopilar datos de la vida silvestre. En las grandes ciudades, Cenwits se puede usar para complementar el GPS, ya que el GPS no funciona de interior y cerca de los rascacielos. Si se informa que una persona A falta, y de los registros de testigos encontramos que sus últimos contactos fueron C y D, podemos rastrear una ubicación aproximada de manera rápida y eficiente.8. Discusión y trabajo futuro Este documento presenta un nuevo sistema de búsqueda y rescate llamado Cenwits que tiene varias ventajas sobre los sistemas de búsqueda y rescate actuales. Estas ventajas incluyen un sistema LooselyCoupled que se basa solo en la conectividad de red intermitente, la eficiencia de energía y almacenamiento, y bajo costo. Resuelve uno de los mayores problemas que afectan a los sistemas modernos de búsqueda y rescate: tiene una capacidad de almacenamiento inherente en el sitio. Esto significa que alguien dentro de la red tendrá acceso a la última información de ubicación conocida de una víctima, y tal vez también su información sobre el rodamiento y la velocidad. Utiliza el concepto de testigos para propagar información, inferir la posible ubicación y velocidad actuales de un sujeto, e identificar áreas de búsqueda y rescate en caso de emergencias. Una gran parte del diseño de Cenwits se centra en abordar las limitaciones de potencia y memoria de los nodos sensores actuales. De hecho, las limitaciones de potencia y memoria dependen de cuánto peso (del nodo del sensor) un excursionista está dispuesto a llevar y el costo de estos sensores. Un objetivo importante de Cenwits es construir pequeñas chips que se puedan implantar en botas de senderismo o chaquetas de esquí. Este objetivo es similar a las balizas de avalancha que actualmente se implantan en chaquetas de esquí. Anticipamos que el poder y la memoria continuarán siendo limitados en dicho entorno. Si bien el documento se centra en el desarrollo de un sistema de búsqueda y rescate, también proporciona algunas ideas innovadoras de nivel de sistema para el procesamiento de información en un sistema de red de sensores. Hemos desarrollado y experimentado con un prototipo básico de CENWITS en la actualidad. El trabajo futuro incluye desarrollar un prototipo más maduro que aborde temas importantes como seguridad, privacidad y alta disponibilidad. Existen varias preocupaciones apremiantes con respecto a la seguridad, la privacidad y la alta disponibilidad en CENWITS. Por ejemplo, un adversario puede oler la información de los testigos para localizar animales en peligro de extinción, hembras, niños, etc. Puede inyectar información falsa en el sistema. Es posible que un individuo no se sienta cómodo proporcionando su información de ubicación y movimiento, a pesar de que definitivamente está interesado en estar ubicado de manera oportuna en el momento de la emergencia. En general, las personas en la comunidad de senderismo son amables y generalmente confiables. Por lo tanto, no se requiere una seguridad a prueba de balas. Sin embargo, cuando CENWITS se usa en el contexto de otras aplicaciones, los requisitos de seguridad pueden cambiar. Dado que los nodos sensores utilizados en Cenwits son frágiles, pueden fallar. De hecho, la naturaleza y el nivel de seguridad, privacidad y soporte de alta disponibilidad que se necesita en CENWITS depende en gran medida de la aplicación para la cual se está utilizando y los sujetos individuales involucrados. En consecuencia, planeamos diseñar un soporte de varios niveles para seguridad, privacidad y alta disponibilidad en CENWITS. Hasta ahora, hemos experimentado con Cenwits en un entorno muy restringido con un pequeño número de sensores. Nuestro próximo objetivo es implementar este sistema en un entorno mucho más grande y más realista. En particular, se están realizando discusiones para desplegar centavos en los Parques Nacionales de Rocky Mountain y Yosemite.9.

        "CenWits: A Sensor-Based Loosely Coupled Search and Rescue System Using Witnesses Jyh-How Huang Department of Computer Science University of Colorado, Campus Box 0430 Boulder, CO 80309-0430 huangjh@cs.colorado.edu Saqib Amjad Department of Computer Science University of Colorado, Campus Box 0430 Boulder, CO 80309-0430 Saqib.Amjad@colorado.edu Shivakant Mishra Department of Computer Science University of Colorado, Campus Box 0430 Boulder, CO 80309-0430 mishras@cs.colorado.edu ABSTRACT This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits.",
        "CenWits uses several small, commonly-available RF-based sensors, and a small number of storage and processing devices.",
        "It is designed for search and rescue of people in emergency situations in wilderness areas.",
        "A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation.",
        "It is designed for an intermittently connected network that provides only occasional connectivity.",
        "It makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
        "A prototype of CenWits has been implemented using Berkeley Mica2 motes.",
        "The paper describes this implementation and reports on the performance measured from it.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Computer-Communication Networks]: Distributed Systems General Terms Algorithms, Design, Experimentation 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Search and rescue of people in emergency situation in a timely manner is an extremely important service.",
        "It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation.",
        "With the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc.",
        "All these systems require a connected network via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices.",
        "This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.",
        "For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.",
        "As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.",
        "While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.",
        "Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car.",
        "An RF transmitter has a relatively smaller range of transmission.",
        "So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area.",
        "In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.",
        "In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.",
        "In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).",
        "CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors.",
        "A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location.",
        "The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world.",
        "This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.",
        "In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.",
        "In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
        "The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network.",
        "Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network.",
        "As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.",
        "Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective.",
        "A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters.",
        "Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.",
        "The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions.",
        "Groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.",
        "Using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information.",
        "In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.",
        "Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.",
        "It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.",
        "This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors.",
        "The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.",
        "However, these techniques are quite general.",
        "We discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques.",
        "While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.",
        "First, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not require a connected network.",
        "Second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization.",
        "Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we overview some of the recent projects and technologies related to movement and location tracking, and search and rescue systems.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the overall architecture of CenWits, and provide a high-level description of its functionality.",
        "In the next section, Section 4, we discuss power and memory management in CenWits.",
        "To simplify our presentation, we will focus on a specific application of tracking lost/injured hikers in all these sections.",
        "In Section 6, we describe a prototype implementation of CenWits and present performance measured from this implementation.",
        "We discuss how the ideas of CenWits can be used to build several other applications in Section 7.",
        "Finally, in Section 8, we discuss some related issues and conclude the paper. 2.",
        "RELATED WORK A survey of location systems for ubiquitous computing is provided in [11].",
        "A location tracking system for adhoc sensor networks using anchor sensors as reference to gain location information and spread it out to outer node is proposed in [17].",
        "Most location tracking systems in adhoc sensor networks are for benefiting geographic-aware routing.",
        "They dont fit well for our purposes.",
        "The well-known active badge system [19] lets a user carry a badge around.",
        "An infrared sensor in the room can detect the presence of a badge and determine the location and identification of the person.",
        "This is a useful system for indoor environment, where GPS doesnt work.",
        "Locationing using 802.11 devices is probably the cheapest solution for indoor position tracking [8].",
        "Because of the popularity and low cost of 802.11 devices, several business solutions based on this technology have been developed[1].",
        "A system that combines two mature technologies and is viable in suburban area where a user can see clear sky and has GSM cellular reception at the same time is currently available[5].",
        "This system receives GPS signal from a satellite and locates itself, draws location on a map, and sends location information through GSM network to the others who are interested in the users location.",
        "A very simple system to monitor children consists an RF transmitter and a receiver.",
        "The system alarms the holder of the receiver when the transmitter is about to run out of range [6].",
        "Personal Locater Beacons (PLB) has been used for avalanche rescuing for years.",
        "A skier carries an RF transmitter that emits beacons periodically, so that a rescue team can find his/her location based on the strength of the RF signal.",
        "Luxury version of PLB combines a GPS receiver and a COSPASSARSAT satellite transmitter that can transmit users location in latitude and longitude to the rescue team whenever an accident happens [4].",
        "However, the device either is turned on all the time resulting in fast battery drain, or must be turned on after the accident to function.",
        "Another related technology in widespread use today is the ONSTAR system [3], typically used in several luxury cars.",
        "In this system, a GPS unit provides position information, and a powerful transmitter relays that information via satellite to a customer service center.",
        "Designed for emergencies, the system can be triggered either by the user with the push of a button, or by a catastrophic accident.",
        "Once the system has been triggered, a human representative attempts to gain communication with the user via a cell phone built as an incar device.",
        "If contact cannot be made, emergency services are dispatched to the location provided by GPS.",
        "Like PLBs, this system has several limitations.",
        "First, it is heavy and expensive.",
        "It requires a satellite transmitter and a connected network.",
        "If connectivity with either the GPS network or a communication satellite cannot be maintained, the system fails.",
        "Unfortunately, these are common obstacles encountered in deep canyons, narrow streets in large cities, parking garages, and a number of other places. 181 The Lifetch system uses GPS receiver board combined with a GSM/GPRS transmitter and an RF transmitter in one wireless sensor node called Intelligent Communication Unit (ICU).",
        "An ICU first attempts to transmit its location to a control center through GSM/GPRS network.",
        "If that fails, it connects with other ICUs (adhoc network) to forward its location information until the information reaches an ICU that has GSM/GPRS reception.",
        "This ICU then transmits the location information of the original ICU via the GSM/GPRS network.",
        "ZebraNet is a system designed to study the moving patterns of zebras [13].",
        "It utilizes two protocols: History-based protocol and flooding protocol.",
        "History-based protocol is used when the zebras are grazing and not moving around too much.",
        "While this might be useful for tracking zebras, its not suitable for tracking hikers because two hikers are most likely to meet each other only once on a trail.",
        "In the flooding protocol, a node dumps its data to a neighbor whenever it finds one and doesnt delete its own copy until it finds a base station.",
        "Without considering routing loops, packet filtering and grouping, the size of data on a node will grow exponentially and drain the power and memory of a sensor node with in a short time.",
        "Instead, Cenwits uses a four-phase hand-shake protocol to ensure that a node transmits only as much information as the other node is willing to receive.",
        "While ZebraNet is designed for a big group of sensors moving together in the same direction with same speed, Cenwits is designed to be used in the scenario where sensors move in different directions at different speeds.",
        "Delay tolerant network architecture addresses some important problems in challenged (resource-constrained) networks [9].",
        "While this work is mainly concerned with interoperability of challenged networks, some problems related to occasionally-connected networks are similar to the ones we have addressed in CenWits.",
        "Among all these systems, luxury PLB and Lifetch are designed for location tracking in wilderness areas.",
        "However, both of these systems require a connected network.",
        "Luxury PLB requires the user to transmit a signal to a satellite, while Lifetch requires connection to GSM/GPRS network.",
        "Luxury PLB transmits location information, only when an accident happens.",
        "However, if the user is buried in the snow or falls into a deep canyon, there is almost no chance for the signal to go through and be relayed to the rescue team.",
        "This is because satellite transmission needs line of sight.",
        "Furthermore, since there is no known history of users location, it is not possible for the rescue team to infer the current location of the user.",
        "Another disadvantage of luxury PLB is that a satellite transmitter is very expensive, costing in the range of $750.",
        "Lifetch attempts to transmit the location information by GSM/GPRS and adhoc sensor network that uses AODV as the routing protocol.",
        "However, having a cellular reception in remote areas in wilderness areas, e.g.",
        "American national parks is unlikely.",
        "Furthermore, it is extremely unlikely that ICUs worn by hikers will be able to form an adhoc network in a large wilderness area.",
        "This is because the hikers are mobile and it is very unlikely to have several ICUs placed dense enough to forward packets even on a very popular hike route.",
        "CenWits is designed to address the limitations of systems such as luxury PLB and Lifetch.",
        "It is designed to provide hikers, skiers, and climbers who have their activities mainly in wilderness areas a much higher chance to convey their location information to a control center.",
        "It is not reliant upon constant connectivity with any communication medium.",
        "Rather, it communicates information along from user to user, finally arriving at a control center.",
        "Unlike several of the systems discussed so far, it does not require that a users unit is constantly turned on.",
        "In fact, it can discover a victims location, even if the victims sensor was off at the time of accident and has remained off since then.",
        "CenWits solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
        "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
        "Figure 1: Hiker A and Hiker B are are not in the range of each other 3.",
        "CENWITS We describe CenWits in the context of locating lost/injured hikers in wilderness areas.",
        "Each hiker wears a sensor (MICA2 motes in our prototype) equipped with a GPS receiver and an RF transmitter.",
        "Each sensor is assigned a unique ID and maintains its current location based on the signal received by its GPS receiver.",
        "It also emits beacons periodically.",
        "When any two sensors are in the range of one another, they record the presence of each other (witness information), and also exchange the witness information they recorded earlier.",
        "The key idea here is that if two sensors come with in range of each other at any time, they become each others witnesses.",
        "Later on, if the hiker wearing one of these sensors is lost, the other sensor can convey the last known (witnessed) location of the lost hiker.",
        "Furthermore, by exchanging the witness information that each sensor recorded earlier, the witness information is propagated beyond a direct contact between two sensors.",
        "To convey witness information to a processing center or to a rescue team, access points are established at well-known locations that the hikers are expected to pass through, e.g. at the trail heads, trail ends, intersection of different trails, scenic view points, resting areas, and so on.",
        "Whenever a sensor node is in the vicinity of an access point, all witness information stored in that sensor is automatically dumped to the access point.",
        "Access points are connected to a processing center via satellite or some other network1 .",
        "The witness information is downloaded to the processing center from various access points at regular intervals.",
        "In case, connection to an access point is lost, the information from that 1 A connection is needed only between access points and a processing center.",
        "There is no need for any connection between different access points. 182 access point can be downloaded manually, e.g. by UAVs.",
        "To estimate the speed, location and direction of a hiker at any point in time, all witness information of that hiker that has been collected from various access points is processed.",
        "Figure 2: Hiker A and Hiker B are in the range of each other.",
        "A records the presence of B and B records the presence of A.",
        "A and B become each others witnesses.",
        "Figure 3: Hiker A is in the range of an access point.",
        "It uploads its recorded witness information and clears its memory.",
        "An example of how CenWits operates is illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3.",
        "First, hikers A and B are on two close trails, but out of range of each other (Figure 1).",
        "This is a very common scenario during a hike.",
        "For example, on a popular four-hour hike, a hiker might run into as many as 20 other hikers.",
        "This accounts for one encounter every 12 minutes on average.",
        "A slow hiker can go 1 mile (5,280 feet) per hour.",
        "Thus in 12 minutes a slow hiker can go as far as 1056 feet.",
        "This implies that if we were to put 20 hikers on a 4-hour, one-way hike evenly, the range of each sensor node should be at least 1056 feet for them to communicate with one another continuously.",
        "The signal strength starts dropping rapidly for two Mica2 nodes to communicate with each other when they are 180 feet away, and is completely lost when they are 230 feet away from each other[7].",
        "So, for the sensors to form a sensor network on a 4-hour hiking trail, there should be at least 120 hikers scattered evenly.",
        "Clearly, this is extremely unlikely.",
        "In fact, in a 4-hour, less-popular hiking trail, one might only run into say five other hikers.",
        "CenWits takes advantage of the fact that sensors can communicate with one another and record their presence.",
        "Given a walking speed of one mile per hour (88 feet per minute) and Mica2 range of about 150 feet for non-line-of-sight radio transmission, two hikers have about 150/88 = 1.7 minutes to discover the presence of each other and exchange their witness information.",
        "We therefore design our system to have each sensor emit a beacon every one-and-a-half minute.",
        "In Figure 2, hiker Bs sensor emits a beacon when A is in range, this triggers A to exchange data with B.",
        "A communicates the following information to B: My ID is A; I saw C at 1:23 PM at (39◦ 49.3277655, 105◦ 39.1126776), I saw E at 3:09 PM at (40◦ 49.2234879, 105◦ 20.3290168).",
        "B then replies with My ID is B; I saw K at 11:20 AM at (39◦ 51.4531655, 105◦ 41.6776223).",
        "In addition, A records I saw B at 4:17 PM at (41◦ 29.3177354, 105◦ 04.9106211) and B records I saw A at 4:17 PM at (41◦ 29.3177354, 105◦ 04.9106211).",
        "B goes on his way to overnight camping while A heads back to trail head where there is an AP, which emits beacon every 5 seconds to avoid missing any hiker.",
        "A dumps all witness information it has collected to the access point.",
        "This is shown in Figure 3. 3.1 Witness Information: Storage A critical concern is that there is limited amount of memory available on motes (4 KB SDRAM memory, 128 KB flash memory, and 4-512 KB EEPROM).",
        "So, it is important to organize witness information efficiently.",
        "CenWits stores witness information at each node as a set of witness records (Format is shown in Figure 4. 1 B Node ID Record Time X, Y Location Time Hop Count 1 B 3 B 8 B 3 B Figure 4: Format of a witness record.",
        "When two nodes i and j encounter each other, each node generates a new witness record.",
        "In the witness record generated by i, Node ID is j, Record Time is the current time in is clock, (X,Y) are the coordinates of the location of i that i recorded most recently (either from satellite or an LP), Location Time is the time when the this location was recorded, and Hop Count is 0.",
        "Each node is assigned a unique Node Id when it enters a trail.",
        "In our current prototype, we have allocated one byte for Node Id, although this can be increased to two or more bytes if a large number of hikers are expected to be present at the same time.",
        "We can represent time in 17 bits to a second precision.",
        "So, we have allocated 3 bytes each for Record Time and Location Time.",
        "The circumference of the Earth is approximately 40,075 KM.",
        "If we use a 32-bit number to represent both longitude and latitude, the precision we get is 40,075,000/232 = 0.0093 meter = 0.37 inches, which is quite precise for our needs.",
        "So, we have allocated 4 bytes each for X and Y coordinates of the location of a node.",
        "In fact, a foot precision can be achieved by using only 27 bits. 3.2 Location Point and Location Inference Although a GPS receiver provides an accurate location information, it has its limitation.",
        "In canyons and rainy forests, a GPS receiver does not work.",
        "When there is a heavy cloud cover, GPS users have experienced inaccuracy in the reported location as well.",
        "Unfortunately, a lot of hiking trails are in dense forests and canyons, and its not that uncommon to rain after hikers start hiking.",
        "To address this, CenWits incorporates the idea of location points (LP).",
        "A location point can update a sensor node with its current location whenever the node is near that LP.",
        "LPs are placed at different locations in a wilderness area where GPS receivers dont work.",
        "An LP is a very simple device that emits prerecorded location information at some regular time interval.",
        "It can be placed in difficult-to-reach places such as deep canyons and dense rain forests by simply dropping them from an airplane.",
        "LPs allow a sensor node to determine its current location more accurately.",
        "However, they are not 183 an essential requirement of CenWits.",
        "If an LP runs out of power, the CenWits will continue to work correctly.",
        "Figure 5: GPS receiver not working correctly.",
        "Sensors then have to rely on LP to provide coordination In Figure 5, B cannot get GPS reception due to bad weather.",
        "It then runs into A on the trail who doesnt have GPS reception either.",
        "Their sensors record the presence of each other.",
        "After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A.",
        "When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter location of A and B.",
        "By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be inferred.",
        "Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).",
        "Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.",
        "CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.",
        "Such a synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available.",
        "In addition, sensor nodes in CenWits synchronize their clocks whenever they are in the range of an AP or an LP.",
        "The Figure 8: Based on overlapping landscape, B might have hiked to wrong branch and fallen off a cliff.",
        "Hot rescue areas can thus be determined synchronization accuracy Cenwits needs is of the order of a second or so.",
        "As long as the clocks are synchronized with in one second range, whether A met B at 12:3745 or 12:3746 doesnt matter in the ordering of witness events and inferring the path. 4.",
        "MEMORY AND POWER MANAGEMENT CenWits employs several important mechanisms to conserve power and memory.",
        "It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory.",
        "With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of witness information stored at a node can get very large.",
        "This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of witness information over time.",
        "To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically.",
        "This raises an interesting question of when and which witness record should be deleted from the memory of a node?",
        "CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap.",
        "Record count refers to the number of witness records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory.",
        "A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT.",
        "It stores at most MAX RECORD COUNT witness records of any node.",
        "Every witness record has a hop count field that stores the number times (hops) this record has been transferred since being created.",
        "Initially this field is set to 0.",
        "Whenever a node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.",
        "A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT.",
        "It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.",
        "The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.",
        "We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet.",
        "The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up.",
        "For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes.",
        "On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node.",
        "Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two witness records with the same node id.",
        "To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two witness records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP.",
        "For each node id i, n stores the witness record with the most recent record time rti, the witness with most recent record time that is at least MIN RECORD GAP time units before rti, and so on until the record count limit (MAX RECORD COUNT) is reached.",
        "When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory.",
        "It decrements MAX RECORD COUNT and MAX HOP COUNT, and increments MIN RECORD GAP.",
        "It then first erases all witness records whose hop count exceeds the reduced MAX HOP COUNT value, and then erases witness records to satisfy the record gap criteria.",
        "Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its witness information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions.",
        "For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a beacon every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour.",
        "However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a beacon should be emitted every 10 seconds.",
        "If a user is not moving at all, a beacon can be emitted every 10 minutes.",
        "In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time.",
        "If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy.",
        "In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals.",
        "For example, suppose hiker A has communicated its witness information to three other hikers in the last five minutes.",
        "If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes.",
        "It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional witness information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes.",
        "It goes to sleep mode if it is extremely low on power.",
        "The bandwidth and energy limitations of sensor nodes require that the amount of data transferred among the nodes be reduced to minimum.",
        "It has been observed that in some scenarios 3000 instructions could be executed for the same energy cost of sending a bit 100m by radio [15].",
        "To reduce the amount of data transfer, CenWits employs a handshake protocol that two nodes execute when they encounter one another.",
        "The goal of this protocol is to ensure that a node transmits only as much witness information as the other node is willing to receive.",
        "This protocol is initiated when a node i receives a beacon containing the node ID of the sender node j and i has not exchanged witness information with j in the last δ time units.",
        "Assume that i < j.",
        "The protocol consists of four phases (See Figure 9): 1.",
        "Phase I: Node i sends its receive constraints and the number of witness records it has in its memory. 2.",
        "Phase II: On receiving this message from i, j sends its receive constraints and the number of witness records it has in its memory. 3.",
        "Phase III: On receiving the above message from j, i sends its witness information (filtered based on receive constraints received in phase II). 4.",
        "Phase IV: After receiving the witness records from i, j sends its witness information (filtered based on receive constraints received in phase I). j <Constaints, Witness info size> <Constaints, Witness info size> <Filtered Witness info> <Filtered Witness info> i j j j i i i Figure 9: Four-Phase Hand Shake Protocol (i < j) Receive constraints are a function of memory and power.",
        "In the most general case, they are comprised of the three parameters (record count, hop count and record gap) used for memory management.",
        "If i is low on memory, it specifies the maximum number of records it is willing to accept from j.",
        "Similarly, i can ask j to send only those records that have hop count value less than MAX HOP COUNT − 1.",
        "Finally, i can include its MIN RECORD GAP value in its receive constraints.",
        "Note that the handshake protocol is beneficial to both i and j.",
        "They save memory by receiving only as much information as they are willing to accept and conserve energy by sending only as many witness records as needed.",
        "It turns out that filtering witness records based on MIN RECORD GAP is complex.",
        "It requires that the witness records of any given node be arranged in an order sorted by their record time values.",
        "Maintaining this sorted order is complex in memory, because new witness records with the same node id can arrive later that may have to be inserted in between to preserve the sorted order.",
        "For this reason, the receive constraints in the current CenWits prototype do not include record gap.",
        "Suppose i specifies a hop count value of 3.",
        "In this case, j checks the hop count field of every witness record before sending them.",
        "If the hop count value is greater than 3, the record is not transmitted. 4.3 Groups and Partitions To further reduce communication and increase the lifetime of our system, we introduce the notion of groups.",
        "The idea is based on the concept of abstract regions presented in [20].",
        "A group is a set of n nodes that can be defined in terms of radio connectivity, geographic location, or other properties of nodes.",
        "All nodes within a group can communicate directly with one another and they share information to maintain their view of the external world.",
        "At any point in time, a group has exactly one leader that communicates 185 with external nodes on behalf of the entire group.",
        "A group can be static, meaning that the group membership does not change over the period of time, or it could be dynamic in which case nodes can leave or join the group.",
        "To make our analysis simple and to explain the advantages of group, we first discuss static groups.",
        "A static group is formed at the start of a hiking trail or ski slope.",
        "Suppose there are five family members who want to go for a hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park.",
        "Before these members start their hike, each one of them is given a sensor node and the information is entered in the system that the five nodes form a group.",
        "Each group member is given a unique id and every group member knows about other members of the group.",
        "The group, as a whole, is also assigned an id to distinguish it from other groups in the system.",
        "Figure 10: A group of five people.",
        "Node 2 is the group leader and it is communicating on behalf of the group with an external node 17.",
        "All other (shown in a lighter shade) are in sleep mode.",
        "As the group moves through the trail, it exchanges information with other nodes or groups that it comes across.",
        "At any point in time, only one group member, called the leader, sends and receives information on behalf of the group and all other n − 1 group members are put in the sleep mode (See Figure 10).",
        "It is this property of groups that saves us energy.",
        "The group leadership is time-multiplexed among the group members.",
        "This is done to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery due to continuous exchange of information.",
        "Thus after every t seconds, the leadership is passed on to another node, called the successor, and the leader (now an ordinary member) is put to sleep.",
        "Since energy is dear, we do not implement an extensive election algorithm for choosing the successor.",
        "Instead, we choose the successor on the basis of node id.",
        "The node with the next highest id in the group is chosen as the successor.",
        "The last node, of course, chooses the node with the lowest id as its successor.",
        "We now discuss the data storage schemes for groups.",
        "Memory is a scarce resource in sensor nodes and it is therefore important that witness information be stored efficiently among group members.",
        "Efficient data storage is not a trivial task when it comes to groups.",
        "The tradeoff is between simplicity of the scheme and memory savings.",
        "A simpler scheme incurs lesser energy cost as compared to a more sophisticated scheme, but offers lesser memory savings as well.",
        "This is because in a more complicated scheme, the group members have to coordinate to update and store information.",
        "After considering a number of different schemes, we have come to a conclusion that there is no optimal storage scheme for groups.",
        "The system should be able to adapt according to its requirements.",
        "If group members are low on battery, then the group can adapt a scheme that is more energy efficient.",
        "Similarly, if the group members are running out of memory, they can adapt a scheme that is more memory efficient.",
        "We first present a simple scheme that is very energy efficient but does not offer significant memory savings.",
        "We then present an alternate scheme that is much more memory efficient.",
        "As already mentioned a group can receive information only through the group leader.",
        "Whenever the leader comes across an external node e, it receives information from that node and saves it.",
        "In our first scheme, when the timeslot for the leader expires, the leader passes this new information it received from e to its successor.",
        "This is important because during the next time slot, if the new leader comes across another external node, it should be able to pass information about all the external nodes this group has witnessed so far.",
        "Thus the information is fully replicated on all nodes to maintain the correct view of the world.",
        "Our first scheme does not offer any memory savings but is highly energy efficient and may be a good choice when the group members are running low on battery.",
        "Except for the time when the leadership is switched, all n − 1 members are asleep at any given time.",
        "This means that a single member is up for t seconds once every n∗t seconds and therefore has to spend approximately only 1/nth of its energy.",
        "Thus, if there are 5 members in a group, we save 80% energy, which is huge.",
        "More energy can be saved by increasing the group size.",
        "We now present an alternate data storage scheme that aims at saving memory at the cost of energy.",
        "In this scheme we divide the group into what we call partitions.",
        "Partitions can be thought of as subgroups within a group.",
        "Each partition must have at least two nodes in it.",
        "The nodes within a partition are called peers.",
        "Each partition has one peer designated as partition leader.",
        "The partition leader stays in receive mode at all times, while all others peers a partition stay in the sleep mode.",
        "Partition leadership is time-multiplexed among the peers to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery.",
        "Like before, a group has exactly one leader and the leadership is time-multiplexed among partitions.",
        "The group leader also serves as the partition leader for the partition it belongs to (See Figure 11).",
        "In this scheme, all partition leaders participate in information exchange.",
        "Whenever a group comes across an external node e, every partition leader receives all witness information, but it only stores a subset of that information after filtering.",
        "Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send witness information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to.",
        "However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode.",
        "Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their witness information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide.",
        "All this is achieved by having the group leader send a signal to every partition leader in turn. 186 Figure 11: The figure shows a group of eight nodes divided into four partitions of 2 nodes each.",
        "Node 1 is the group leader whereas nodes 2, 9, and 7 are partition leaders.",
        "All other nodes are in the sleep mode.",
        "Since the partition leadership is time-multiplexed, it is important that any information received by the partition leader, p1, be passed on to the next leader, p2.",
        "This has to be done to make sure that p2 has all the information that it might need to send when it comes across another external node during its timeslot.",
        "One way of achieving this is to wake p2 up just before p1s timeslot expires and then have p1 transfer information only to p2.",
        "An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers.",
        "Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep.",
        "In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information.",
        "In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes.",
        "In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers.",
        "Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one.",
        "A group can be divided into partitions in more than one way.",
        "For example, suppose we have a group of six members.",
        "We can divide this group into three partitions of two peers each, or two partitions with three peers each.",
        "The choice once again depends on the requirements of the system.",
        "A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient.",
        "This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time.",
        "On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12).",
        "A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery.",
        "This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node.",
        "For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node.",
        "Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all witness information stored in that partition will be lost.",
        "We have devised a very simple protocol to solve this problem.",
        "We first explain how partiFigure 12: The figure shows two different ways of partitioning a group of six nodes.",
        "In (a), a group is divided into three partitions of two nodes.",
        "Node 1 is the group leader, nodes 9 and 5 are partition leaders, and nodes 2, 3, and 6 are in sleep mode.",
        "In (b) the group is divided into two partitions of three nodes.",
        "Node 1 is the group leader, node 9 is the partition leader and nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6 are in sleep mode. tions are adjusted when a peer dies, and then explain what happens if a partition leader dies.",
        "Suppose node 2 in figure 3 (a) dies.",
        "When node 5, the partition leader, sends information to node 2, it does not receive an acknowledgement from it and concludes that node 2 has died2 .",
        "At this point, node 5 contacts other partition leaders (nodes 1 ... 9) using a broadcast message and informs them that one of its peers has died.",
        "Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of witness information stored in its partition.",
        "Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders.",
        "Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition.",
        "However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition.",
        "It chooses the partition that has the least amount of witness information to join.",
        "It sends its witness information to the new partition leader.",
        "Witness information and membership update is propagated to all peers during the next partition leadership change.",
        "We now consider the case where the partition leader dies.",
        "If this happens, then we wait for the partition leadership to change and for the new partition leader to eventually find out that a peer has died.",
        "Once the new partition leader finds out that it needs more peers, it proceeds with the protocol explained above.",
        "However, in this case, we do lose information that the previous partition leader might have received just before it died.",
        "This problem can be solved by implementing a more rigorous protocol, but we have decided to give up on accuracy to save energy.",
        "Our current design uses time-division multiplexing to schedule wakeup and sleep modes in the sensor nodes.",
        "However, recent work on radio wakeup sensors [10] can be used to do this scheduling more efficiently. we plan to incorporate radio wakeup sensors in CenWits when the hardware is mature. 2 The algorithm to conclude that a node has died can be made more rigorous by having the partition leader query the suspected node a few times. 187 5.",
        "SYSTEM EVALUATION A sensor is constrained in the amount of memory and power.",
        "In general, the amount of memory needed and power consumption depends on a variety of factors such as node density, number of hiker encounters, and the number of access points.",
        "In this Section, we provide an estimate of how long the power of a MICA2 mote will last under certain assumtions.",
        "First, we assume that each sensor node carries about 100 witness records.",
        "On encountering another hiker, a sensor node transmits 50 witness records and receives 50 new witness records.",
        "Since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take 0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34 seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link.",
        "The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh.",
        "Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per hour.",
        "So, average power consumtion due to transmission and reception is (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 mA per hour.",
        "Given that the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500 mAh, a battery should last for 2500/15.75 = 159 hours of transmission and reception.",
        "An encounter between two hikers results in exchange of about 50 witness records that takes about 0.68 seconds as calculated above.",
        "Thus, a single alkaline battery can last for (159 ∗ 60 ∗ 60)/0.68 = 841764 hiker encounters.",
        "Assuming that a node emits a beacon every 90 seconds and a hiker encounter occurs everytime a beacon is emitted (worst-case scenario), a single alkaline battery will last for (841764 ∗ 90)/(30 ∗ 24 ∗ 60 ∗ 60) = 29 days.",
        "Since, a Mica2 is equipped with two batteries, a Mica2 sensor can remain operation for about two months.",
        "Notice that this calculation is preliminary, because it assumes that hikers are active 24 hours of the day and a hiker encounter occurs every 90 seconds.",
        "In a more realistic scenario, power is expected to last for a much longer time period.",
        "Also, this time period will significantly increase when groups of hikers are moving together.",
        "Finally, the lifetime of a sensor running on two batteries can definitely be increased significantly by using energy scavenging techniques and energy harvesting techniques [16, 14]. 6.",
        "PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION We have implemented a prototype of CenWits on MICA2 sensor 900MHz running Mantis OS 0.9.1b.",
        "One of the sensor is equipped with MTS420CA GPS module, which is capable of barometric pressure and two-axis acceleration sensing in addition to GPS location tracking.",
        "We use SiRF, the serial communication protocol, to control GPS module.",
        "SiRF has a rich command set, but we record only X and Y coordinates.",
        "A witness record is 16 bytes long.",
        "When a node starts up, it stores its current location and emits a beacon periodicallyin the prototype, a node emits a beacon every minute.",
        "We have conducted a number of experiments with this prototype.",
        "A detailed report on these experiments with the raw data collected and photographs of hikers, access points etc. is available at http://csel.cs.colorado.edu/∼huangjh/ Cenwits.index.htm.",

        "In all these experiments, there are three access points (A, B and C) where nodes dump their witness information.",
        "These access points also provide location information to the nodes that come with in their range.",
        "We first show how CenWits can be used to determine the hiking trail a hiker is most likely on and the speed at which he is hiking, and identify hot search areas in case he is reported missing.",
        "Next, we show the results of power and memory management techniques of CenWits in conserving power and memory of a sensor node in one of our experiments. 6.1 Locating Lost Hikers The first experiment is called Direct Contact.",
        "It is a very simple experiment in which a single hiker starts from A, goes to B and then C, and finally returns to A (See Figure 13).",
        "The goal of this experiment is to illustrate that CenWits can deduce the trail a hiker takes by processing witness information.",

        "For example, A,1 at 16 means 1 came in contact with A at time 16.",
        "Using this information, we can infer the direction in which hiker 1 was moving and speed at which he was moving.",

        "Thus (18,10) is a more accurate location of encounter between 1 and 2.",
        "Finally, our third experiment called Identifying Hot Search Areas is designed to determine the trail a hiker has taken and identify hot search areas for rescue after he is reported missing.",
        "There are six hikers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) in this experiment.",
        "Figure 15 shows the trails that hikers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 took, along with the encounter points obtained from witness records collected at the control center.",
        "For brevity, we have not shown the entire witness information collected at the control center.",
        "This information is available at http://csel.cs.colorado.edu/∼huangjh/Cenwits/index.htm.",
        "Figure 15: Identifying Hot Search Area Experiment (without hiker 6) 189 Now suppose hiker 6 is reported missing at time 260.",
        "To determine the hot search areas, the witness records of hiker 6 are processed to determine the trail he is most likely on, the speed at which he had been moving, direction in which he had been moving, and his last known location.",
        "Based on this information and the hiking trail map, hot search areas are identified.",
        "The hiking trail taken by hiker 6 as inferred by CenWits is shown by a dotted line and the hot search areas identified by CenWits are shown by dark lines inside the dotted circle in Figure 16.",
        "Figure 16: Identifying Hot Search Area Experiment (with hiker 6) 6.2 Results of Power and Memory Management The witness information shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3 has not been filtered using the three criteria described in Section 4.1.",
        "For example, the witness records generated by 3 at record times 76, 78 and 79 (see Table 3) have all been generated due a single contact between access point C and node 3.",
        "By applying the record gap criteria, two of these three records will be erased.",
        "Similarly, the witness records generated by 1 at record times 10, 15 and 16 (see Table 1) have all been generated due a single contact between access point A and node 1.",
        "Again, by applying the record gap criteria, two of these three records will be erased.",
        "Our experiments did not generate enough data to test the impact of record count or hop count criteria.",
        "To evaluate the impact of these criteria, we simulated CenWits to generate a significantly large number of records for a given number of hikers and access points.",
        "We generated witness records by having the hikers walk randomly.",
        "We applied the three criteria to measure the amount of memory savings in a sensor node.",
        "The results are shown in Table 4.",
        "The number of hikers in this simulation was 10 and the number of access points was 5.",
        "The number of witness records reported in this table is an average number of witness records a sensor node stored at the time of dump to an access point.",
        "These results show that the three memory management criteria significantly reduces the memory consumption of sensor nodes in CenWits.",
        "For example, they can reduce MAX MIN MAX # of RECORD RECORD HOP Witness COUNT GAP COUNT Records 5 5 5 628 4 5 5 421 3 5 5 316 5 10 5 311 5 20 5 207 5 5 4 462 5 5 3 341 3 20 3 161 Table 4: Impact of memory management techniques. the memory consumption by up to 75%.",
        "However, these results are premature at present for two reasons: (1) They are generated via simulation of hikers walking at random; and (2) It is not clear what impact the erasing of witness records has on the accuracy of inferred location/hot search areas of lost hikers.",
        "In our future work, we plan to undertake a major study to address these two concerns. 7.",
        "OTHER APPLICATIONS In addition to the hiking in wilderness areas, CenWits can be used in several other applications, e.g. skiing, climbing, wild life monitoring, and person tracking.",
        "Since CenWits relies only on intermittent connectivity, it can take advantage of the existing cheap and mature technologies, and thereby make tracking cheaper and fairly accurate.",
        "Since CenWits doesnt rely on keeping track of a sensor holder all time, but relies on maintaining witnesses, the system is relatively cheaper and widely applicable.",
        "For example, there are some dangerous cliffs in most ski resorts.",
        "But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain.",
        "Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries.",
        "These boundary sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff.",
        "Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs.",
        "If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier.",
        "If there is no witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.",
        "In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals.",
        "To collect data, either a satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver.",
        "GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2].",
        "Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds.",
        "Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it.",
        "Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of deers.",
        "CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces.",
        "CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case.",
        "Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data.",
        "In fact, the access points need not be statically located.",
        "They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.",
        "In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesnt work indoor and near skyscrapers.",
        "If a person A is reported missing, and from the witness records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 8.",
        "DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new search and rescue system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current search and rescue systems.",
        "These advantages include a looselycoupled system that relies only on intermittent network connectivity, power and storage efficiency, and low cost.",
        "It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
        "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
        "It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies.",
        "A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.",
        "In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.",
        "An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.",
        "This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.",
        "We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.",
        "While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system.",
        "We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present.",
        "Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.",
        "There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.",
        "For example, an adversary can sniff the witness information to locate endangered animals, females, children, etc.",
        "He may inject false information in the system.",
        "An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.",
        "In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.",
        "So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.",
        "However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.",
        "Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.",
        "In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.",
        "Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.",
        "So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.",
        "Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment.",
        "In particular, discussions are currenly underway to deploy CenWits in the Rocky Mountain and Yosemite National Parks. 9.",

                "CenWits uses several small, commonly-available RF-based sensors, and a small number of storage and processing devices.",
                "It is designed for <br>search and rescue</br> of people in emergency situations in wilderness areas.",
                "A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation.",
                "It is designed for an intermittently connected network that provides only occasional connectivity.",
                "It makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "A prototype of CenWits has been implemented using Berkeley Mica2 motes.",
                "The paper describes this implementation and reports on the performance measured from it.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Computer-Communication Networks]: Distributed Systems General Terms Algorithms, Design, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION <br>search and rescue</br> of people in emergency situation in a timely manner is an extremely important service.",
                "It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation.",
                "With the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc.",
                "All these systems require a connected network via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices.",
                "This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.",
                "For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.",
                "As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.",
                "While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.",
                "Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car.",
                "An RF transmitter has a relatively smaller range of transmission.",
                "So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area.",
                "In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.",
                "In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.",
                "In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a <br>search and rescue</br> system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).",
                "CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors.",
                "A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location.",
                "The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world.",
                "This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.",
                "In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.",
                "In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network.",
                "Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network.",
                "As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.",
                "Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective.",
                "A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.",
                "The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions.",
                "Groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.",
                "Using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information.",
                "In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.",
                "Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.",
                "It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.",
                "This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors.",
                "The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a <br>search and rescue</br> application.",
                "However, these techniques are quite general.",
                "We discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques.",
                "While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.",
                "First, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not require a connected network.",
                "Second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization.",
                "Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where <br>search and rescue</br> efforts can be concentrated.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we overview some of the recent projects and technologies related to movement and location tracking, and <br>search and rescue</br> systems.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the overall architecture of CenWits, and provide a high-level description of its functionality.",
                "In the next section, Section 4, we discuss power and memory management in CenWits.",
                "To simplify our presentation, we will focus on a specific application of tracking lost/injured hikers in all these sections.",
                "In Section 6, we describe a prototype implementation of CenWits and present performance measured from this implementation.",
                "We discuss how the ideas of CenWits can be used to build several other applications in Section 7.",
                "Finally, in Section 8, we discuss some related issues and conclude the paper. 2.",

                "Their sensors record the presence of each other.",
                "After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A.",
                "When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter location of A and B.",
                "By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be inferred.",
                "Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).",
                "Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.",
                "CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.",
                "Such a synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available.",
                "In addition, sensor nodes in CenWits synchronize their clocks whenever they are in the range of an AP or an LP.",
                "The Figure 8: Based on overlapping landscape, B might have hiked to wrong branch and fallen off a cliff.",
                "Hot rescue areas can thus be determined synchronization accuracy Cenwits needs is of the order of a second or so.",
                "As long as the clocks are synchronized with in one second range, whether A met B at 12:3745 or 12:3746 doesnt matter in the ordering of witness events and inferring the path. 4.",
                "MEMORY AND POWER MANAGEMENT CenWits employs several important mechanisms to conserve power and memory.",
                "It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory.",
                "With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of witness information stored at a node can get very large.",
                "This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of witness information over time.",
                "To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically.",
                "This raises an interesting question of when and which witness record should be deleted from the memory of a node?",
                "CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap.",
                "Record count refers to the number of witness records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT.",
                "It stores at most MAX RECORD COUNT witness records of any node.",
                "Every witness record has a hop count field that stores the number times (hops) this record has been transferred since being created.",
                "Initially this field is set to 0.",
                "Whenever a node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.",
                "We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet.",
                "The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up.",
                "For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes.",
                "On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node.",
                "Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two witness records with the same node id.",
                "To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two witness records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "For each node id i, n stores the witness record with the most recent record time rti, the witness with most recent record time that is at least MIN RECORD GAP time units before rti, and so on until the record count limit (MAX RECORD COUNT) is reached.",
                "When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory.",
                "It decrements MAX RECORD COUNT and MAX HOP COUNT, and increments MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "It then first erases all witness records whose hop count exceeds the reduced MAX HOP COUNT value, and then erases witness records to satisfy the record gap criteria.",
                "Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its witness information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions.",
                "For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a beacon every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour.",
                "However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a beacon should be emitted every 10 seconds.",
                "If a user is not moving at all, a beacon can be emitted every 10 minutes.",
                "In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time.",
                "If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy.",
                "In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals.",
                "For example, suppose hiker A has communicated its witness information to three other hikers in the last five minutes.",
                "If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional witness information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to sleep mode if it is extremely low on power.",
                "The bandwidth and energy limitations of sensor nodes require that the amount of data transferred among the nodes be reduced to minimum.",
                "It has been observed that in some scenarios 3000 instructions could be executed for the same energy cost of sending a bit 100m by radio [15].",
                "To reduce the amount of data transfer, CenWits employs a handshake protocol that two nodes execute when they encounter one another.",
                "The goal of this protocol is to ensure that a node transmits only as much witness information as the other node is willing to receive.",
                "This protocol is initiated when a node i receives a beacon containing the node ID of the sender node j and i has not exchanged witness information with j in the last δ time units.",
                "Assume that i < j.",

                "Phase I: Node i sends its receive constraints and the number of witness records it has in its memory. 2.",
                "Phase II: On receiving this message from i, j sends its receive constraints and the number of witness records it has in its memory. 3.",

                "Phase IV: After receiving the witness records from i, j sends its witness information (filtered based on receive constraints received in phase I). j <Constaints, Witness info size> <Constaints, Witness info size> <Filtered Witness info> <Filtered Witness info> i j j j i i i Figure 9: Four-Phase Hand Shake Protocol (i < j) Receive constraints are a function of memory and power.",
                "In the most general case, they are comprised of the three parameters (record count, hop count and record gap) used for memory management.",
                "If i is low on memory, it specifies the maximum number of records it is willing to accept from j.",
                "Similarly, i can ask j to send only those records that have hop count value less than MAX HOP COUNT − 1.",
                "Finally, i can include its MIN RECORD GAP value in its receive constraints.",
                "Note that the handshake protocol is beneficial to both i and j.",
                "They save memory by receiving only as much information as they are willing to accept and conserve energy by sending only as many witness records as needed.",
                "It turns out that filtering witness records based on MIN RECORD GAP is complex.",
                "It requires that the witness records of any given node be arranged in an order sorted by their record time values.",
                "Maintaining this sorted order is complex in memory, because new witness records with the same node id can arrive later that may have to be inserted in between to preserve the sorted order.",
                "For this reason, the receive constraints in the current CenWits prototype do not include record gap.",
                "Suppose i specifies a hop count value of 3.",

                "If the hop count value is greater than 3, the record is not transmitted. 4.3 Groups and Partitions To further reduce communication and increase the lifetime of our system, we introduce the notion of groups.",
                "The idea is based on the concept of abstract regions presented in [20].",
                "A group is a set of n nodes that can be defined in terms of radio connectivity, geographic location, or other properties of nodes.",

                "At any point in time, a group has exactly one leader that communicates 185 with external nodes on behalf of the entire group.",
                "A group can be static, meaning that the group membership does not change over the period of time, or it could be dynamic in which case nodes can leave or join the group.",

                "Suppose there are five family members who want to go for a hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park.",
                "Before these members start their hike, each one of them is given a sensor node and the information is entered in the system that the five nodes form a group.",
                "Each group member is given a unique id and every group member knows about other members of the group.",

                "More energy can be saved by increasing the group size.",
                "We now present an alternate data storage scheme that aims at saving memory at the cost of energy.",

                "Like before, a group has exactly one leader and the leadership is time-multiplexed among partitions.",
                "The group leader also serves as the partition leader for the partition it belongs to (See Figure 11).",
                "In this scheme, all partition leaders participate in information exchange.",
                "Whenever a group comes across an external node e, every partition leader receives all witness information, but it only stores a subset of that information after filtering.",
                "Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send witness information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to.",
                "However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode.",
                "Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their witness information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide.",
                "All this is achieved by having the group leader send a signal to every partition leader in turn. 186 Figure 11: The figure shows a group of eight nodes divided into four partitions of 2 nodes each.",
                "Node 1 is the group leader whereas nodes 2, 9, and 7 are partition leaders.",
                "All other nodes are in the sleep mode.",
                "Since the partition leadership is time-multiplexed, it is important that any information received by the partition leader, p1, be passed on to the next leader, p2.",
                "This has to be done to make sure that p2 has all the information that it might need to send when it comes across another external node during its timeslot.",
                "One way of achieving this is to wake p2 up just before p1s timeslot expires and then have p1 transfer information only to p2.",
                "An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers.",
                "Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep.",
                "In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information.",
                "In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes.",
                "In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers.",
                "Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one.",
                "A group can be divided into partitions in more than one way.",
                "For example, suppose we have a group of six members.",
                "We can divide this group into three partitions of two peers each, or two partitions with three peers each.",
                "The choice once again depends on the requirements of the system.",
                "A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient.",
                "This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time.",
                "On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12).",
                "A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery.",
                "This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node.",
                "For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node.",
                "Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all witness information stored in that partition will be lost.",
                "We have devised a very simple protocol to solve this problem.",

                "When node 5, the partition leader, sends information to node 2, it does not receive an acknowledgement from it and concludes that node 2 has died2 .",
                "At this point, node 5 contacts other partition leaders (nodes 1 ... 9) using a broadcast message and informs them that one of its peers has died.",
                "Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of witness information stored in its partition.",
                "Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders.",
                "Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition.",
                "However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition.",
                "It chooses the partition that has the least amount of witness information to join.",
                "It sends its witness information to the new partition leader.",
                "Witness information and membership update is propagated to all peers during the next partition leadership change.",
                "We now consider the case where the partition leader dies.",
                "If this happens, then we wait for the partition leadership to change and for the new partition leader to eventually find out that a peer has died.",
                "Once the new partition leader finds out that it needs more peers, it proceeds with the protocol explained above.",
                "However, in this case, we do lose information that the previous partition leader might have received just before it died.",
                "This problem can be solved by implementing a more rigorous protocol, but we have decided to give up on accuracy to save energy.",
                "Our current design uses time-division multiplexing to schedule wakeup and sleep modes in the sensor nodes.",

                "Since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take 0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34 seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link.",
                "The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh.",
                "Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per hour.",
                "So, average power consumtion due to transmission and reception is (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 mA per hour.",

                "An encounter between two hikers results in exchange of about 50 witness records that takes about 0.68 seconds as calculated above.",

                "Assuming that a node emits a beacon every 90 seconds and a hiker encounter occurs everytime a beacon is emitted (worst-case scenario), a single alkaline battery will last for (841764 ∗ 90)/(30 ∗ 24 ∗ 60 ∗ 60) = 29 days.",
                "Since, a Mica2 is equipped with two batteries, a Mica2 sensor can remain operation for about two months.",

                "The number of hikers in this simulation was 10 and the number of access points was 5.",
                "The number of witness records reported in this table is an average number of witness records a sensor node stored at the time of dump to an access point.",
                "These results show that the three memory management criteria significantly reduces the memory consumption of sensor nodes in CenWits.",
                "For example, they can reduce MAX MIN MAX # of RECORD RECORD HOP Witness COUNT GAP COUNT Records 5 5 5 628 4 5 5 421 3 5 5 316 5 10 5 311 5 20 5 207 5 5 4 462 5 5 3 341 3 20 3 161 Table 4: Impact of memory management techniques. the memory consumption by up to 75%.",
                "However, these results are premature at present for two reasons: (1) They are generated via simulation of hikers walking at random; and (2) It is not clear what impact the erasing of witness records has on the accuracy of inferred location/hot search areas of lost hikers.",
                "In our future work, we plan to undertake a major study to address these two concerns. 7.",
                "OTHER APPLICATIONS In addition to the hiking in wilderness areas, CenWits can be used in several other applications, e.g. skiing, climbing, wild life monitoring, and person tracking.",
                "Since CenWits relies only on intermittent connectivity, it can take advantage of the existing cheap and mature technologies, and thereby make tracking cheaper and fairly accurate.",
                "Since CenWits doesnt rely on keeping track of a sensor holder all time, but relies on maintaining witnesses, the system is relatively cheaper and widely applicable.",
                "For example, there are some dangerous cliffs in most ski resorts.",
                "But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain.",
                "Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries.",
                "These boundary sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff.",
                "Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs.",
                "If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier.",
                "If there is no witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.",
                "In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals.",
                "To collect data, either a satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver.",
                "GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2].",
                "Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds.",
                "Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it.",
                "Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of deers.",
                "CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces.",
                "CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case.",
                "Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data.",
                "In fact, the access points need not be statically located.",
                "They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.",
                "In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesnt work indoor and near skyscrapers.",
                "If a person A is reported missing, and from the witness records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 8.",
                "DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new <br>search and rescue</br> system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current <br>search and rescue</br> systems.",
                "These advantages include a looselycoupled system that relies only on intermittent network connectivity, power and storage efficiency, and low cost.",
                "It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern <br>search and rescue</br> systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
                "It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot <br>search and rescue</br> areas in case of emergencies.",
                "A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.",
                "In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.",
                "An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.",
                "This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.",
                "We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.",
                "While the paper focuses on the development of a <br>search and rescue</br> system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system.",
                "We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present.",
                "Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.",
                "There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.",
                "For example, an adversary can sniff the witness information to locate endangered animals, females, children, etc.",
                "He may inject false information in the system.",
                "An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.",
                "In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.",
                "So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.",
                "However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.",
                "Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.",
                "In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.",
                "Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.",
                "So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.",
                "Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment.",
                "In particular, discussions are currenly underway to deploy CenWits in the Rocky Mountain and Yosemite National Parks. 9.",

                "CenWits uses several small, commonly-available RF-based sensors, and a small number of storage and processing devices.",
                "It is designed for search and rescue of people in emergency situations in wilderness areas.",
                "A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation.",
                "It is designed for an intermittently <br>connected network</br> that provides only occasional connectivity.",
                "It makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "A prototype of CenWits has been implemented using Berkeley Mica2 motes.",

                "INTRODUCTION Search and rescue of people in emergency situation in a timely manner is an extremely important service.",
                "It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation.",
                "With the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc.",
                "All these systems require a <br>connected network</br> via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices.",
                "This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a <br>connected network</br> is very difficult.",
                "For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.",
                "As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.",
                "While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.",
                "Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car.",
                "An RF transmitter has a relatively smaller range of transmission.",
                "So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area.",
                "In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.",
                "In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.",
                "In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).",
                "CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors.",
                "A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location.",
                "The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world.",
                "This averts a need for maintaining a <br>connected network</br> to transmit location information to the outside world.",
                "In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.",
                "In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a <br>connected network</br>.",
                "Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently <br>connected network</br>.",
                "As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.",
                "Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective.",
                "A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.",
                "The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions.",
                "Groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.",
                "Using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information.",
                "In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.",
                "Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.",
                "It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.",
                "This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors.",
                "The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.",
                "However, these techniques are quite general.",
                "We discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques.",
                "While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.",
                "First, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not require a <br>connected network</br>.",
                "Second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization.",
                "Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we overview some of the recent projects and technologies related to movement and location tracking, and search and rescue systems.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the overall architecture of CenWits, and provide a high-level description of its functionality.",
                "In the next section, Section 4, we discuss power and memory management in CenWits.",
                "To simplify our presentation, we will focus on a specific application of tracking lost/injured hikers in all these sections.",
                "In Section 6, we describe a prototype implementation of CenWits and present performance measured from this implementation.",
                "We discuss how the ideas of CenWits can be used to build several other applications in Section 7.",
                "Finally, in Section 8, we discuss some related issues and conclude the paper. 2.",

                "Their sensors record the presence of each other.",
                "After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A.",
                "When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter location of A and B.",
                "By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be inferred.",
                "Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).",
                "Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.",
                "CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.",
                "Such a synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available.",
                "In addition, sensor nodes in CenWits synchronize their clocks whenever they are in the range of an AP or an LP.",

                "As long as the clocks are synchronized with in one second range, whether A met B at 12:3745 or 12:3746 doesnt matter in the ordering of witness events and inferring the path. 4.",
                "MEMORY AND POWER MANAGEMENT CenWits employs several important mechanisms to conserve power and memory.",
                "It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory.",
                "With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of witness information stored at a node can get very large.",
                "This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of witness information over time.",
                "To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically.",
                "This raises an interesting question of when and which witness record should be deleted from the memory of a node?",
                "CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap.",
                "Record count refers to the number of witness records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT.",
                "It stores at most MAX RECORD COUNT witness records of any node.",
                "Every witness record has a hop count field that stores the number times (hops) this record has been transferred since being created.",
                "Initially this field is set to 0.",
                "Whenever a node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.",
                "We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet.",
                "The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up.",
                "For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes.",
                "On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node.",
                "Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two witness records with the same node id.",
                "To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two witness records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "For each node id i, n stores the witness record with the most recent record time rti, the witness with most recent record time that is at least MIN RECORD GAP time units before rti, and so on until the record count limit (MAX RECORD COUNT) is reached.",
                "When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory.",
                "It decrements MAX RECORD COUNT and MAX HOP COUNT, and increments MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "It then first erases all witness records whose hop count exceeds the reduced MAX HOP COUNT value, and then erases witness records to satisfy the record gap criteria.",
                "Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its witness information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions.",
                "For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a beacon every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour.",
                "However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a beacon should be emitted every 10 seconds.",
                "If a user is not moving at all, a beacon can be emitted every 10 minutes.",
                "In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time.",
                "If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy.",
                "In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals.",
                "For example, suppose hiker A has communicated its witness information to three other hikers in the last five minutes.",
                "If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional witness information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to sleep mode if it is extremely low on power.",
                "The bandwidth and energy limitations of sensor nodes require that the amount of data transferred among the nodes be reduced to minimum.",
                "It has been observed that in some scenarios 3000 instructions could be executed for the same energy cost of sending a bit 100m by radio [15].",
                "To reduce the amount of data transfer, CenWits employs a handshake protocol that two nodes execute when they encounter one another.",
                "The goal of this protocol is to ensure that a node transmits only as much witness information as the other node is willing to receive.",
                "This protocol is initiated when a node i receives a beacon containing the node ID of the sender node j and i has not exchanged witness information with j in the last δ time units.",

                "Note that the handshake protocol is beneficial to both i and j.",
                "They save memory by receiving only as much information as they are willing to accept and conserve energy by sending only as many witness records as needed.",
                "It turns out that filtering witness records based on MIN RECORD GAP is complex.",
                "It requires that the witness records of any given node be arranged in an order sorted by their record time values.",
                "Maintaining this sorted order is complex in memory, because new witness records with the same node id can arrive later that may have to be inserted in between to preserve the sorted order.",
                "For this reason, the receive constraints in the current CenWits prototype do not include record gap.",
                "Suppose i specifies a hop count value of 3.",

                "If the hop count value is greater than 3, the record is not transmitted. 4.3 Groups and Partitions To further reduce communication and increase the lifetime of our system, we introduce the notion of groups.",
                "The idea is based on the concept of abstract regions presented in [20].",
                "A group is a set of n nodes that can be defined in terms of radio connectivity, geographic location, or other properties of nodes.",
                "All nodes within a group can communicate directly with one another and they share information to maintain their view of the external world.",
                "At any point in time, a group has exactly one leader that communicates 185 with external nodes on behalf of the entire group.",
                "A group can be static, meaning that the group membership does not change over the period of time, or it could be dynamic in which case nodes can leave or join the group.",
                "To make our analysis simple and to explain the advantages of group, we first discuss static groups.",
                "A static group is formed at the start of a hiking trail or ski slope.",
                "Suppose there are five family members who want to go for a hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park.",
                "Before these members start their hike, each one of them is given a sensor node and the information is entered in the system that the five nodes form a group.",
                "Each group member is given a unique id and every group member knows about other members of the group.",
                "The group, as a whole, is also assigned an id to distinguish it from other groups in the system.",
                "Figure 10: A group of five people.",
                "Node 2 is the group leader and it is communicating on behalf of the group with an external node 17.",
                "All other (shown in a lighter shade) are in sleep mode.",
                "As the group moves through the trail, it exchanges information with other nodes or groups that it comes across.",
                "At any point in time, only one group member, called the leader, sends and receives information on behalf of the group and all other n − 1 group members are put in the sleep mode (See Figure 10).",
                "It is this property of groups that saves us energy.",
                "The group leadership is time-multiplexed among the group members.",
                "This is done to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery due to continuous exchange of information.",
                "Thus after every t seconds, the leadership is passed on to another node, called the successor, and the leader (now an ordinary member) is put to sleep.",
                "Since energy is dear, we do not implement an extensive election algorithm for choosing the successor.",
                "Instead, we choose the successor on the basis of node id.",
                "The node with the next highest id in the group is chosen as the successor.",
                "The last node, of course, chooses the node with the lowest id as its successor.",
                "We now discuss the data storage schemes for groups.",
                "Memory is a scarce resource in sensor nodes and it is therefore important that witness information be stored efficiently among group members.",
                "Efficient data storage is not a trivial task when it comes to groups.",
                "The tradeoff is between simplicity of the scheme and memory savings.",
                "A simpler scheme incurs lesser energy cost as compared to a more sophisticated scheme, but offers lesser memory savings as well.",
                "This is because in a more complicated scheme, the group members have to coordinate to update and store information.",
                "After considering a number of different schemes, we have come to a conclusion that there is no optimal storage scheme for groups.",
                "The system should be able to adapt according to its requirements.",
                "If group members are low on battery, then the group can adapt a scheme that is more energy efficient.",
                "Similarly, if the group members are running out of memory, they can adapt a scheme that is more memory efficient.",
                "We first present a simple scheme that is very energy efficient but does not offer significant memory savings.",
                "We then present an alternate scheme that is much more memory efficient.",
                "As already mentioned a group can receive information only through the group leader.",
                "Whenever the leader comes across an external node e, it receives information from that node and saves it.",
                "In our first scheme, when the timeslot for the leader expires, the leader passes this new information it received from e to its successor.",
                "This is important because during the next time slot, if the new leader comes across another external node, it should be able to pass information about all the external nodes this group has witnessed so far.",
                "Thus the information is fully replicated on all nodes to maintain the correct view of the world.",
                "Our first scheme does not offer any memory savings but is highly energy efficient and may be a good choice when the group members are running low on battery.",
                "Except for the time when the leadership is switched, all n − 1 members are asleep at any given time.",
                "This means that a single member is up for t seconds once every n∗t seconds and therefore has to spend approximately only 1/nth of its energy.",
                "Thus, if there are 5 members in a group, we save 80% energy, which is huge.",
                "More energy can be saved by increasing the group size.",
                "We now present an alternate data storage scheme that aims at saving memory at the cost of energy.",
                "In this scheme we divide the group into what we call partitions.",
                "Partitions can be thought of as subgroups within a group.",
                "Each partition must have at least two nodes in it.",
                "The nodes within a partition are called peers.",
                "Each partition has one peer designated as partition leader.",
                "The partition leader stays in receive mode at all times, while all others peers a partition stay in the sleep mode.",
                "Partition leadership is time-multiplexed among the peers to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery.",
                "Like before, a group has exactly one leader and the leadership is time-multiplexed among partitions.",
                "The group leader also serves as the partition leader for the partition it belongs to (See Figure 11).",
                "In this scheme, all partition leaders participate in information exchange.",
                "Whenever a group comes across an external node e, every partition leader receives all witness information, but it only stores a subset of that information after filtering.",
                "Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send witness information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to.",
                "However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode.",
                "Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their witness information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide.",
                "All this is achieved by having the group leader send a signal to every partition leader in turn. 186 Figure 11: The figure shows a group of eight nodes divided into four partitions of 2 nodes each.",
                "Node 1 is the group leader whereas nodes 2, 9, and 7 are partition leaders.",
                "All other nodes are in the sleep mode.",
                "Since the partition leadership is time-multiplexed, it is important that any information received by the partition leader, p1, be passed on to the next leader, p2.",
                "This has to be done to make sure that p2 has all the information that it might need to send when it comes across another external node during its timeslot.",
                "One way of achieving this is to wake p2 up just before p1s timeslot expires and then have p1 transfer information only to p2.",
                "An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers.",
                "Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep.",
                "In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information.",
                "In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes.",
                "In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers.",
                "Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one.",
                "A group can be divided into partitions in more than one way.",
                "For example, suppose we have a group of six members.",
                "We can divide this group into three partitions of two peers each, or two partitions with three peers each.",
                "The choice once again depends on the requirements of the system.",
                "A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient.",
                "This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time.",
                "On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12).",
                "A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery.",
                "This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node.",
                "For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node.",
                "Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all witness information stored in that partition will be lost.",
                "We have devised a very simple protocol to solve this problem.",
                "We first explain how partiFigure 12: The figure shows two different ways of partitioning a group of six nodes.",

                "Node 1 is the group leader, node 9 is the partition leader and nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6 are in sleep mode. tions are adjusted when a peer dies, and then explain what happens if a partition leader dies.",
                "Suppose node 2 in figure 3 (a) dies.",
                "When node 5, the partition leader, sends information to node 2, it does not receive an acknowledgement from it and concludes that node 2 has died2 .",
                "At this point, node 5 contacts other partition leaders (nodes 1 ... 9) using a broadcast message and informs them that one of its peers has died.",
                "Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of witness information stored in its partition.",
                "Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders.",
                "Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition.",
                "However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition.",
                "It chooses the partition that has the least amount of witness information to join.",
                "It sends its witness information to the new partition leader.",
                "Witness information and membership update is propagated to all peers during the next partition leadership change.",
                "We now consider the case where the partition leader dies.",
                "If this happens, then we wait for the partition leadership to change and for the new partition leader to eventually find out that a peer has died.",
                "Once the new partition leader finds out that it needs more peers, it proceeds with the protocol explained above.",
                "However, in this case, we do lose information that the previous partition leader might have received just before it died.",
                "This problem can be solved by implementing a more rigorous protocol, but we have decided to give up on accuracy to save energy.",
                "Our current design uses time-division multiplexing to schedule wakeup and sleep modes in the sensor nodes.",
                "However, recent work on radio wakeup sensors [10] can be used to do this scheduling more efficiently. we plan to incorporate radio wakeup sensors in CenWits when the hardware is mature. 2 The algorithm to conclude that a node has died can be made more rigorous by having the partition leader query the suspected node a few times. 187 5.",
                "SYSTEM EVALUATION A sensor is constrained in the amount of memory and power.",
                "In general, the amount of memory needed and power consumption depends on a variety of factors such as node density, number of hiker encounters, and the number of access points.",
                "In this Section, we provide an estimate of how long the power of a MICA2 mote will last under certain assumtions.",

                "Since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take 0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34 seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link.",
                "The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh.",
                "Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per hour.",
                "So, average power consumtion due to transmission and reception is (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 mA per hour.",

                "An encounter between two hikers results in exchange of about 50 witness records that takes about 0.68 seconds as calculated above.",

                "Assuming that a node emits a beacon every 90 seconds and a hiker encounter occurs everytime a beacon is emitted (worst-case scenario), a single alkaline battery will last for (841764 ∗ 90)/(30 ∗ 24 ∗ 60 ∗ 60) = 29 days.",
                "Since, a Mica2 is equipped with two batteries, a Mica2 sensor can remain operation for about two months.",

                "The hiking trail taken by hiker 6 as inferred by CenWits is shown by a dotted line and the hot search areas identified by CenWits are shown by dark lines inside the dotted circle in Figure 16.",

                "Similarly, the witness records generated by 1 at record times 10, 15 and 16 (see Table 1) have all been generated due a single contact between access point A and node 1.",

                "OTHER APPLICATIONS In addition to the hiking in wilderness areas, CenWits can be used in several other applications, e.g. skiing, climbing, wild life monitoring, and person tracking.",
                "Since CenWits relies only on intermittent connectivity, it can take advantage of the existing cheap and mature technologies, and thereby make tracking cheaper and fairly accurate.",
                "Since CenWits doesnt rely on keeping track of a sensor holder all time, but relies on maintaining witnesses, the system is relatively cheaper and widely applicable.",
                "For example, there are some dangerous cliffs in most ski resorts.",
                "But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain.",
                "Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries.",
                "These boundary sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff.",
                "Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs.",
                "If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier.",
                "If there is no witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.",
                "In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals.",
                "To collect data, either a satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver.",
                "GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2].",
                "Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds.",
                "Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it.",
                "Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of deers.",
                "CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces.",
                "CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case.",
                "Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data.",
                "In fact, the access points need not be statically located.",
                "They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.",
                "In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesnt work indoor and near skyscrapers.",
                "If a person A is reported missing, and from the witness records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 8.",
                "DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new search and rescue system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current search and rescue systems.",
                "These advantages include a looselycoupled system that relies only on intermittent network connectivity, power and storage efficiency, and low cost.",
                "It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
                "It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies.",
                "A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.",
                "In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.",
                "An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.",
                "This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.",
                "We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.",
                "While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system.",
                "We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present.",
                "Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.",
                "There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.",
                "For example, an adversary can sniff the witness information to locate endangered animals, females, children, etc.",
                "He may inject false information in the system.",
                "An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.",
                "In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.",
                "So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.",
                "However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.",
                "Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.",
                "In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.",
                "Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.",
                "So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.",
                "Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment.",
                "In particular, discussions are currenly underway to deploy CenWits in the Rocky Mountain and Yosemite National Parks. 9.",

                "CenWits uses several small, commonly-available RF-based sensors, and a small number of storage and processing devices.",
                "It is designed for search and rescue of people in emergency situations in wilderness areas.",
                "A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation.",

                "It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an <br>emergency situation</br>.",
                "With the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc.",
                "All these systems require a connected network via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices.",
                "This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.",
                "For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.",
                "As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.",
                "While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.",
                "Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car.",
                "An RF transmitter has a relatively smaller range of transmission.",
                "So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area.",
                "In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.",
                "In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.",
                "In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).",
                "CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors.",
                "A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location.",
                "The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world.",
                "This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.",
                "In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.",
                "In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network.",
                "Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network.",
                "As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.",
                "Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective.",
                "A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.",
                "The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions.",
                "Groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.",
                "Using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information.",
                "In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.",
                "Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.",
                "It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.",
                "This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors.",
                "The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.",
                "However, these techniques are quite general.",
                "We discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques.",
                "While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.",
                "First, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not require a connected network.",
                "Second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization.",
                "Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",

                "To simplify our presentation, we will focus on a specific application of tracking lost/injured hikers in all these sections.",

                "After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A.",
                "When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter location of A and B.",
                "By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be inferred.",
                "Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).",
                "Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.",
                "CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.",
                "Such a synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available.",

                "MEMORY AND POWER MANAGEMENT CenWits employs several important mechanisms to conserve power and memory.",
                "It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory.",
                "With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of witness information stored at a node can get very large.",
                "This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of witness information over time.",
                "To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically.",
                "This raises an interesting question of when and which witness record should be deleted from the memory of a node?",
                "CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap.",
                "Record count refers to the number of witness records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT.",
                "It stores at most MAX RECORD COUNT witness records of any node.",
                "Every witness record has a hop count field that stores the number times (hops) this record has been transferred since being created.",
                "Initially this field is set to 0.",
                "Whenever a node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.",
                "We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet.",
                "The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up.",
                "For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes.",
                "On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node.",
                "Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two witness records with the same node id.",
                "To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two witness records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "For each node id i, n stores the witness record with the most recent record time rti, the witness with most recent record time that is at least MIN RECORD GAP time units before rti, and so on until the record count limit (MAX RECORD COUNT) is reached.",
                "When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory.",
                "It decrements MAX RECORD COUNT and MAX HOP COUNT, and increments MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "It then first erases all witness records whose hop count exceeds the reduced MAX HOP COUNT value, and then erases witness records to satisfy the record gap criteria.",
                "Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its witness information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions.",
                "For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a beacon every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour.",
                "However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a beacon should be emitted every 10 seconds.",
                "If a user is not moving at all, a beacon can be emitted every 10 minutes.",
                "In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time.",
                "If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy.",
                "In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals.",
                "For example, suppose hiker A has communicated its witness information to three other hikers in the last five minutes.",
                "If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional witness information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to sleep mode if it is extremely low on power.",
                "The bandwidth and energy limitations of sensor nodes require that the amount of data transferred among the nodes be reduced to minimum.",
                "It has been observed that in some scenarios 3000 instructions could be executed for the same energy cost of sending a bit 100m by radio [15].",
                "To reduce the amount of data transfer, CenWits employs a handshake protocol that two nodes execute when they encounter one another.",
                "The goal of this protocol is to ensure that a node transmits only as much witness information as the other node is willing to receive.",
                "This protocol is initiated when a node i receives a beacon containing the node ID of the sender node j and i has not exchanged witness information with j in the last δ time units.",

                "If i is low on memory, it specifies the maximum number of records it is willing to accept from j.",
                "Similarly, i can ask j to send only those records that have hop count value less than MAX HOP COUNT − 1.",
                "Finally, i can include its MIN RECORD GAP value in its receive constraints.",
                "Note that the handshake protocol is beneficial to both i and j.",
                "They save memory by receiving only as much information as they are willing to accept and conserve energy by sending only as many witness records as needed.",
                "It turns out that filtering witness records based on MIN RECORD GAP is complex.",
                "It requires that the witness records of any given node be arranged in an order sorted by their record time values.",
                "Maintaining this sorted order is complex in memory, because new witness records with the same node id can arrive later that may have to be inserted in between to preserve the sorted order.",

                "The idea is based on the concept of abstract regions presented in [20].",

                "At any point in time, a group has exactly one leader that communicates 185 with external nodes on behalf of the entire group.",
                "A group can be static, meaning that the group membership does not change over the period of time, or it could be dynamic in which case nodes can leave or join the group.",
                "To make our analysis simple and to explain the advantages of group, we first discuss static groups.",
                "A static group is formed at the start of a hiking trail or ski slope.",
                "Suppose there are five family members who want to go for a hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park.",
                "Before these members start their hike, each one of them is given a sensor node and the information is entered in the system that the five nodes form a group.",
                "Each group member is given a unique id and every group member knows about other members of the group.",
                "The group, as a whole, is also assigned an id to distinguish it from other groups in the system.",
                "Figure 10: A group of five people.",
                "Node 2 is the group leader and it is communicating on behalf of the group with an external node 17.",
                "All other (shown in a lighter shade) are in sleep mode.",
                "As the group moves through the trail, it exchanges information with other nodes or groups that it comes across.",
                "At any point in time, only one group member, called the leader, sends and receives information on behalf of the group and all other n − 1 group members are put in the sleep mode (See Figure 10).",
                "It is this property of groups that saves us energy.",
                "The group leadership is time-multiplexed among the group members.",
                "This is done to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery due to continuous exchange of information.",
                "Thus after every t seconds, the leadership is passed on to another node, called the successor, and the leader (now an ordinary member) is put to sleep.",
                "Since energy is dear, we do not implement an extensive election algorithm for choosing the successor.",
                "Instead, we choose the successor on the basis of node id.",

                "We now discuss the data storage schemes for groups.",
                "Memory is a scarce resource in sensor nodes and it is therefore important that witness information be stored efficiently among group members.",
                "Efficient data storage is not a trivial task when it comes to groups.",
                "The tradeoff is between simplicity of the scheme and memory savings.",
                "A simpler scheme incurs lesser energy cost as compared to a more sophisticated scheme, but offers lesser memory savings as well.",
                "This is because in a more complicated scheme, the group members have to coordinate to update and store information.",
                "After considering a number of different schemes, we have come to a conclusion that there is no optimal storage scheme for groups.",
                "The system should be able to adapt according to its requirements.",
                "If group members are low on battery, then the group can adapt a scheme that is more energy efficient.",
                "Similarly, if the group members are running out of memory, they can adapt a scheme that is more memory efficient.",
                "We first present a simple scheme that is very energy efficient but does not offer significant memory savings.",
                "We then present an alternate scheme that is much more memory efficient.",
                "As already mentioned a group can receive information only through the group leader.",
                "Whenever the leader comes across an external node e, it receives information from that node and saves it.",
                "In our first scheme, when the timeslot for the leader expires, the leader passes this new information it received from e to its successor.",
                "This is important because during the next time slot, if the new leader comes across another external node, it should be able to pass information about all the external nodes this group has witnessed so far.",
                "Thus the information is fully replicated on all nodes to maintain the correct view of the world.",
                "Our first scheme does not offer any memory savings but is highly energy efficient and may be a good choice when the group members are running low on battery.",
                "Except for the time when the leadership is switched, all n − 1 members are asleep at any given time.",
                "This means that a single member is up for t seconds once every n∗t seconds and therefore has to spend approximately only 1/nth of its energy.",
                "Thus, if there are 5 members in a group, we save 80% energy, which is huge.",
                "More energy can be saved by increasing the group size.",
                "We now present an alternate data storage scheme that aims at saving memory at the cost of energy.",
                "In this scheme we divide the group into what we call partitions.",
                "Partitions can be thought of as subgroups within a group.",
                "Each partition must have at least two nodes in it.",
                "The nodes within a partition are called peers.",
                "Each partition has one peer designated as partition leader.",
                "The partition leader stays in receive mode at all times, while all others peers a partition stay in the sleep mode.",
                "Partition leadership is time-multiplexed among the peers to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery.",
                "Like before, a group has exactly one leader and the leadership is time-multiplexed among partitions.",
                "The group leader also serves as the partition leader for the partition it belongs to (See Figure 11).",
                "In this scheme, all partition leaders participate in information exchange.",
                "Whenever a group comes across an external node e, every partition leader receives all witness information, but it only stores a subset of that information after filtering.",
                "Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send witness information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to.",
                "However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode.",
                "Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their witness information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide.",
                "All this is achieved by having the group leader send a signal to every partition leader in turn. 186 Figure 11: The figure shows a group of eight nodes divided into four partitions of 2 nodes each.",
                "Node 1 is the group leader whereas nodes 2, 9, and 7 are partition leaders.",
                "All other nodes are in the sleep mode.",
                "Since the partition leadership is time-multiplexed, it is important that any information received by the partition leader, p1, be passed on to the next leader, p2.",
                "This has to be done to make sure that p2 has all the information that it might need to send when it comes across another external node during its timeslot.",
                "One way of achieving this is to wake p2 up just before p1s timeslot expires and then have p1 transfer information only to p2.",
                "An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers.",
                "Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep.",
                "In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information.",
                "In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes.",
                "In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers.",
                "Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one.",
                "A group can be divided into partitions in more than one way.",
                "For example, suppose we have a group of six members.",
                "We can divide this group into three partitions of two peers each, or two partitions with three peers each.",
                "The choice once again depends on the requirements of the system.",
                "A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient.",
                "This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time.",
                "On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12).",
                "A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery.",
                "This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node.",
                "For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node.",
                "Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all witness information stored in that partition will be lost.",
                "We have devised a very simple protocol to solve this problem.",
                "We first explain how partiFigure 12: The figure shows two different ways of partitioning a group of six nodes.",

                "Suppose node 2 in figure 3 (a) dies.",
                "When node 5, the partition leader, sends information to node 2, it does not receive an acknowledgement from it and concludes that node 2 has died2 .",
                "At this point, node 5 contacts other partition leaders (nodes 1 ... 9) using a broadcast message and informs them that one of its peers has died.",
                "Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of witness information stored in its partition.",
                "Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders.",
                "Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition.",
                "However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition.",
                "It chooses the partition that has the least amount of witness information to join.",
                "It sends its witness information to the new partition leader.",
                "Witness information and membership update is propagated to all peers during the next partition leadership change.",
                "We now consider the case where the partition leader dies.",
                "If this happens, then we wait for the partition leadership to change and for the new partition leader to eventually find out that a peer has died.",
                "Once the new partition leader finds out that it needs more peers, it proceeds with the protocol explained above.",
                "However, in this case, we do lose information that the previous partition leader might have received just before it died.",
                "This problem can be solved by implementing a more rigorous protocol, but we have decided to give up on accuracy to save energy.",
                "Our current design uses time-division multiplexing to schedule wakeup and sleep modes in the sensor nodes.",
                "However, recent work on radio wakeup sensors [10] can be used to do this scheduling more efficiently. we plan to incorporate radio wakeup sensors in CenWits when the hardware is mature. 2 The algorithm to conclude that a node has died can be made more rigorous by having the partition leader query the suspected node a few times. 187 5.",
                "SYSTEM EVALUATION A sensor is constrained in the amount of memory and power.",
                "In general, the amount of memory needed and power consumption depends on a variety of factors such as node density, number of hiker encounters, and the number of access points.",

                "Since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take 0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34 seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link.",
                "The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh.",
                "Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per hour.",
                "So, average power consumtion due to transmission and reception is (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 mA per hour.",

                "An encounter between two hikers results in exchange of about 50 witness records that takes about 0.68 seconds as calculated above.",

                "Since, a Mica2 is equipped with two batteries, a Mica2 sensor can remain operation for about two months.",

                "Assuming a constant hiking speed and a relatively straight-line hike, it can be computed that at time 16, hiker 1 must have been at location (18,10).",

                "In our future work, we plan to undertake a major study to address these two concerns. 7.",
                "OTHER APPLICATIONS In addition to the hiking in wilderness areas, CenWits can be used in several other applications, e.g. skiing, climbing, wild life monitoring, and person tracking.",
                "Since CenWits relies only on intermittent connectivity, it can take advantage of the existing cheap and mature technologies, and thereby make tracking cheaper and fairly accurate.",
                "Since CenWits doesnt rely on keeping track of a sensor holder all time, but relies on maintaining witnesses, the system is relatively cheaper and widely applicable.",
                "For example, there are some dangerous cliffs in most ski resorts.",
                "But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain.",
                "Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries.",
                "These boundary sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff.",
                "Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs.",
                "If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier.",
                "If there is no witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.",
                "In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals.",
                "To collect data, either a satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver.",
                "GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2].",
                "Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds.",
                "Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it.",
                "Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of deers.",
                "CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces.",
                "CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case.",
                "Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data.",
                "In fact, the access points need not be statically located.",
                "They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.",
                "In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesnt work indoor and near skyscrapers.",
                "If a person A is reported missing, and from the witness records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 8.",
                "DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new search and rescue system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current search and rescue systems.",
                "These advantages include a looselycoupled system that relies only on intermittent network connectivity, power and storage efficiency, and low cost.",
                "It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
                "It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies.",
                "A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.",
                "In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.",
                "An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.",
                "This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.",
                "We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.",
                "While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system.",
                "We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present.",
                "Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.",
                "There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.",
                "For example, an adversary can sniff the witness information to locate endangered animals, females, children, etc.",
                "He may inject false information in the system.",
                "An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.",
                "In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.",
                "So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.",
                "However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.",
                "Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.",
                "In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.",
                "Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.",
                "So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.",
                "Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment.",
                "In particular, discussions are currenly underway to deploy CenWits in the Rocky Mountain and Yosemite National Parks. 9.",

                "It is designed for search and rescue of people in emergency situations in wilderness areas.",
                "A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation.",

                "INTRODUCTION Search and rescue of people in emergency situation in a timely manner is an extremely important service.",
                "It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation.",
                "With the emergence of <br>pervasive computing</br>, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc.",
                "All these systems require a connected network via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices.",
                "This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.",
                "For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.",
                "As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.",
                "While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.",
                "Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car.",
                "An RF transmitter has a relatively smaller range of transmission.",
                "So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area.",
                "In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.",
                "In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.",
                "In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).",
                "CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors.",
                "A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location.",
                "The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world.",
                "This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.",
                "In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.",
                "In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network.",
                "Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network.",
                "As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.",
                "Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective.",
                "A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.",
                "The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions.",
                "Groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.",
                "Using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information.",
                "In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.",
                "Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.",
                "It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.",
                "This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors.",
                "The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.",
                "However, these techniques are quite general.",
                "We discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques.",
                "While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.",
                "First, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not require a connected network.",
                "Second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization.",
                "Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we overview some of the recent projects and technologies related to movement and location tracking, and search and rescue systems.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the overall architecture of CenWits, and provide a high-level description of its functionality.",
                "In the next section, Section 4, we discuss power and memory management in CenWits.",
                "To simplify our presentation, we will focus on a specific application of tracking lost/injured hikers in all these sections.",
                "In Section 6, we describe a prototype implementation of CenWits and present performance measured from this implementation.",

                "It then runs into A on the trail who doesnt have GPS reception either.",
                "Their sensors record the presence of each other.",
                "After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A.",
                "When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter location of A and B.",
                "By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be inferred.",
                "Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).",
                "Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.",
                "CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.",
                "Such a synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available.",
                "In addition, sensor nodes in CenWits synchronize their clocks whenever they are in the range of an AP or an LP.",
                "The Figure 8: Based on overlapping landscape, B might have hiked to wrong branch and fallen off a cliff.",
                "Hot rescue areas can thus be determined synchronization accuracy Cenwits needs is of the order of a second or so.",
                "As long as the clocks are synchronized with in one second range, whether A met B at 12:3745 or 12:3746 doesnt matter in the ordering of witness events and inferring the path. 4.",
                "MEMORY AND POWER MANAGEMENT CenWits employs several important mechanisms to conserve power and memory.",
                "It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory.",
                "With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of witness information stored at a node can get very large.",
                "This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of witness information over time.",
                "To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically.",
                "This raises an interesting question of when and which witness record should be deleted from the memory of a node?",
                "CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap.",
                "Record count refers to the number of witness records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT.",
                "It stores at most MAX RECORD COUNT witness records of any node.",
                "Every witness record has a hop count field that stores the number times (hops) this record has been transferred since being created.",
                "Initially this field is set to 0.",
                "Whenever a node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.",
                "We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet.",
                "The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up.",
                "For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes.",
                "On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node.",
                "Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two witness records with the same node id.",
                "To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two witness records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "For each node id i, n stores the witness record with the most recent record time rti, the witness with most recent record time that is at least MIN RECORD GAP time units before rti, and so on until the record count limit (MAX RECORD COUNT) is reached.",
                "When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory.",
                "It decrements MAX RECORD COUNT and MAX HOP COUNT, and increments MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "It then first erases all witness records whose hop count exceeds the reduced MAX HOP COUNT value, and then erases witness records to satisfy the record gap criteria.",
                "Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its witness information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions.",
                "For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a beacon every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour.",
                "However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a beacon should be emitted every 10 seconds.",
                "If a user is not moving at all, a beacon can be emitted every 10 minutes.",
                "In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time.",
                "If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy.",
                "In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals.",
                "For example, suppose hiker A has communicated its witness information to three other hikers in the last five minutes.",
                "If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional witness information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to sleep mode if it is extremely low on power.",
                "The bandwidth and energy limitations of sensor nodes require that the amount of data transferred among the nodes be reduced to minimum.",

                "Similarly, i can ask j to send only those records that have hop count value less than MAX HOP COUNT − 1.",
                "Finally, i can include its MIN RECORD GAP value in its receive constraints.",

                "A static group is formed at the start of a hiking trail or ski slope.",

                "The group, as a whole, is also assigned an id to distinguish it from other groups in the system.",

                "All other (shown in a lighter shade) are in sleep mode.",
                "As the group moves through the trail, it exchanges information with other nodes or groups that it comes across.",
                "At any point in time, only one group member, called the leader, sends and receives information on behalf of the group and all other n − 1 group members are put in the sleep mode (See Figure 10).",
                "It is this property of groups that saves us energy.",
                "The group leadership is time-multiplexed among the group members.",
                "This is done to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery due to continuous exchange of information.",
                "Thus after every t seconds, the leadership is passed on to another node, called the successor, and the leader (now an ordinary member) is put to sleep.",
                "Since energy is dear, we do not implement an extensive election algorithm for choosing the successor.",
                "Instead, we choose the successor on the basis of node id.",

                "A simpler scheme incurs lesser energy cost as compared to a more sophisticated scheme, but offers lesser memory savings as well.",
                "This is because in a more complicated scheme, the group members have to coordinate to update and store information.",
                "After considering a number of different schemes, we have come to a conclusion that there is no optimal storage scheme for groups.",
                "The system should be able to adapt according to its requirements.",
                "If group members are low on battery, then the group can adapt a scheme that is more energy efficient.",
                "Similarly, if the group members are running out of memory, they can adapt a scheme that is more memory efficient.",
                "We first present a simple scheme that is very energy efficient but does not offer significant memory savings.",
                "We then present an alternate scheme that is much more memory efficient.",

                "Whenever the leader comes across an external node e, it receives information from that node and saves it.",
                "In our first scheme, when the timeslot for the leader expires, the leader passes this new information it received from e to its successor.",
                "This is important because during the next time slot, if the new leader comes across another external node, it should be able to pass information about all the external nodes this group has witnessed so far.",
                "Thus the information is fully replicated on all nodes to maintain the correct view of the world.",
                "Our first scheme does not offer any memory savings but is highly energy efficient and may be a good choice when the group members are running low on battery.",
                "Except for the time when the leadership is switched, all n − 1 members are asleep at any given time.",
                "This means that a single member is up for t seconds once every n∗t seconds and therefore has to spend approximately only 1/nth of its energy.",
                "Thus, if there are 5 members in a group, we save 80% energy, which is huge.",
                "More energy can be saved by increasing the group size.",
                "We now present an alternate data storage scheme that aims at saving memory at the cost of energy.",
                "In this scheme we divide the group into what we call partitions.",
                "Partitions can be thought of as subgroups within a group.",
                "Each partition must have at least two nodes in it.",
                "The nodes within a partition are called peers.",
                "Each partition has one peer designated as partition leader.",
                "The partition leader stays in receive mode at all times, while all others peers a partition stay in the sleep mode.",
                "Partition leadership is time-multiplexed among the peers to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery.",
                "Like before, a group has exactly one leader and the leadership is time-multiplexed among partitions.",
                "The group leader also serves as the partition leader for the partition it belongs to (See Figure 11).",
                "In this scheme, all partition leaders participate in information exchange.",
                "Whenever a group comes across an external node e, every partition leader receives all witness information, but it only stores a subset of that information after filtering.",
                "Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send witness information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to.",
                "However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode.",
                "Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their witness information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide.",
                "All this is achieved by having the group leader send a signal to every partition leader in turn. 186 Figure 11: The figure shows a group of eight nodes divided into four partitions of 2 nodes each.",
                "Node 1 is the group leader whereas nodes 2, 9, and 7 are partition leaders.",
                "All other nodes are in the sleep mode.",
                "Since the partition leadership is time-multiplexed, it is important that any information received by the partition leader, p1, be passed on to the next leader, p2.",
                "This has to be done to make sure that p2 has all the information that it might need to send when it comes across another external node during its timeslot.",
                "One way of achieving this is to wake p2 up just before p1s timeslot expires and then have p1 transfer information only to p2.",
                "An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers.",
                "Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep.",
                "In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information.",
                "In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes.",
                "In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers.",
                "Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one.",
                "A group can be divided into partitions in more than one way.",
                "For example, suppose we have a group of six members.",
                "We can divide this group into three partitions of two peers each, or two partitions with three peers each.",
                "The choice once again depends on the requirements of the system.",
                "A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient.",
                "This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time.",
                "On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12).",
                "A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery.",
                "This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node.",
                "For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node.",
                "Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all witness information stored in that partition will be lost.",
                "We have devised a very simple protocol to solve this problem.",

                "Suppose node 2 in figure 3 (a) dies.",
                "When node 5, the partition leader, sends information to node 2, it does not receive an acknowledgement from it and concludes that node 2 has died2 .",
                "At this point, node 5 contacts other partition leaders (nodes 1 ... 9) using a broadcast message and informs them that one of its peers has died.",
                "Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of witness information stored in its partition.",
                "Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders.",
                "Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition.",
                "However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition.",
                "It chooses the partition that has the least amount of witness information to join.",
                "It sends its witness information to the new partition leader.",

                "We now consider the case where the partition leader dies.",

                "Once the new partition leader finds out that it needs more peers, it proceeds with the protocol explained above.",
                "However, in this case, we do lose information that the previous partition leader might have received just before it died.",
                "This problem can be solved by implementing a more rigorous protocol, but we have decided to give up on accuracy to save energy.",

                "Since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take 0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34 seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link.",
                "The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh.",
                "Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per hour.",
                "So, average power consumtion due to transmission and reception is (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 mA per hour.",

                "For example, when hikers 1 and 2 meet at time 16, the last recorded location time of Node Id Record (X,Y) Location Hop Time Time Count 3 78 (12,23) 78 0 3 107 (31,17) 107 0 3 106 (31,17) 106 0 3 76 (12,23) 76 0 3 79 (12,23) 79 0 2 94 (12,23) 79 0 1 16 (?,?) ? 1 1 15 (?,?) ? 1 Table 3: Witness information collected from hiker 3 in indirect inference experiment. hiker 1 is (12,7) recorded at time 6.",
                "So, node 1 generates a witness record with record time 16, location (12,7) and location time 6.",
                "In fact, the last two records in Table 3 have (?,?) as their location.",
                "This has happened because these witness records were generate by hiker 2 during his encounter with 1 at time 15 and 16.",
                "Until this time, hiker 2 hadnt come in contact with any location points.",
                "Interestingly, a more accurate location information of 1 and 2 encounter or 2 and 3 encounter can be computed by process the witness information at the control center.",
                "It took 25 units of time for hiker 1 to go from A (12,7) to B (31,17).",
                "Assuming a constant hiking speed and a relatively straight-line hike, it can be computed that at time 16, hiker 1 must have been at location (18,10).",
                "Thus (18,10) is a more accurate location of encounter between 1 and 2.",

                "In our future work, we plan to undertake a major study to address these two concerns. 7.",
                "OTHER APPLICATIONS In addition to the hiking in wilderness areas, CenWits can be used in several other applications, e.g. skiing, climbing, wild life monitoring, and person tracking.",
                "Since CenWits relies only on intermittent connectivity, it can take advantage of the existing cheap and mature technologies, and thereby make tracking cheaper and fairly accurate.",
                "Since CenWits doesnt rely on keeping track of a sensor holder all time, but relies on maintaining witnesses, the system is relatively cheaper and widely applicable.",
                "For example, there are some dangerous cliffs in most ski resorts.",
                "But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain.",
                "Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries.",
                "These boundary sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff.",
                "Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs.",
                "If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier.",
                "If there is no witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.",
                "In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals.",
                "To collect data, either a satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver.",
                "GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2].",
                "Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds.",
                "Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it.",
                "Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of deers.",
                "CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces.",
                "CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case.",
                "Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data.",
                "In fact, the access points need not be statically located.",
                "They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.",
                "In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesnt work indoor and near skyscrapers.",
                "If a person A is reported missing, and from the witness records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 8.",
                "DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new search and rescue system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current search and rescue systems.",
                "These advantages include a looselycoupled system that relies only on intermittent network connectivity, power and storage efficiency, and low cost.",
                "It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
                "It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies.",
                "A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.",
                "In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.",
                "An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.",
                "This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.",
                "We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.",
                "While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system.",
                "We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present.",
                "Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.",
                "There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.",
                "For example, an adversary can sniff the witness information to locate endangered animals, females, children, etc.",
                "He may inject false information in the system.",
                "An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.",
                "In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.",
                "So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.",
                "However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.",
                "Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.",
                "In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.",
                "Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.",
                "So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.",
                "Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment.",
                "In particular, discussions are currenly underway to deploy CenWits in the Rocky Mountain and Yosemite National Parks. 9.",

                "INTRODUCTION Search and rescue of people in emergency situation in a timely manner is an extremely important service.",
                "It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation.",
                "With the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc.",
                "All these systems require a connected network via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices.",
                "This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.",
                "For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.",
                "As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.",
                "While a <br>satellite transmitter</br> is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.",
                "Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car.",
                "An RF transmitter has a relatively smaller range of transmission.",
                "So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area.",
                "In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.",
                "In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.",
                "In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).",
                "CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors.",
                "A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location.",
                "The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world.",
                "This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.",
                "In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.",
                "In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network.",
                "Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network.",
                "As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.",
                "Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective.",
                "A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.",
                "The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions.",
                "Groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.",
                "Using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information.",
                "In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.",
                "Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.",
                "It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.",
                "This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors.",
                "The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.",
                "However, these techniques are quite general.",
                "We discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques.",
                "While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.",
                "First, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not require a connected network.",
                "Second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization.",
                "Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we overview some of the recent projects and technologies related to movement and location tracking, and search and rescue systems.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the overall architecture of CenWits, and provide a high-level description of its functionality.",
                "In the next section, Section 4, we discuss power and memory management in CenWits.",
                "To simplify our presentation, we will focus on a specific application of tracking lost/injured hikers in all these sections.",

                "Their sensors record the presence of each other.",
                "After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A.",
                "When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter location of A and B.",
                "By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be inferred.",
                "Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).",
                "Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.",
                "CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.",
                "Such a synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available.",
                "In addition, sensor nodes in CenWits synchronize their clocks whenever they are in the range of an AP or an LP.",
                "The Figure 8: Based on overlapping landscape, B might have hiked to wrong branch and fallen off a cliff.",
                "Hot rescue areas can thus be determined synchronization accuracy Cenwits needs is of the order of a second or so.",
                "As long as the clocks are synchronized with in one second range, whether A met B at 12:3745 or 12:3746 doesnt matter in the ordering of witness events and inferring the path. 4.",
                "MEMORY AND POWER MANAGEMENT CenWits employs several important mechanisms to conserve power and memory.",
                "It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory.",
                "With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of witness information stored at a node can get very large.",
                "This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of witness information over time.",
                "To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically.",
                "This raises an interesting question of when and which witness record should be deleted from the memory of a node?",
                "CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap.",
                "Record count refers to the number of witness records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT.",
                "It stores at most MAX RECORD COUNT witness records of any node.",
                "Every witness record has a hop count field that stores the number times (hops) this record has been transferred since being created.",
                "Initially this field is set to 0.",
                "Whenever a node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.",
                "We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet.",
                "The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up.",
                "For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes.",
                "On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node.",
                "Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two witness records with the same node id.",
                "To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two witness records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "For each node id i, n stores the witness record with the most recent record time rti, the witness with most recent record time that is at least MIN RECORD GAP time units before rti, and so on until the record count limit (MAX RECORD COUNT) is reached.",
                "When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory.",
                "It decrements MAX RECORD COUNT and MAX HOP COUNT, and increments MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "It then first erases all witness records whose hop count exceeds the reduced MAX HOP COUNT value, and then erases witness records to satisfy the record gap criteria.",
                "Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its witness information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions.",
                "For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a beacon every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour.",
                "However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a beacon should be emitted every 10 seconds.",
                "If a user is not moving at all, a beacon can be emitted every 10 minutes.",
                "In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time.",
                "If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy.",
                "In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals.",
                "For example, suppose hiker A has communicated its witness information to three other hikers in the last five minutes.",
                "If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional witness information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes.",

                "In the most general case, they are comprised of the three parameters (record count, hop count and record gap) used for memory management.",
                "If i is low on memory, it specifies the maximum number of records it is willing to accept from j.",
                "Similarly, i can ask j to send only those records that have hop count value less than MAX HOP COUNT − 1.",
                "Finally, i can include its MIN RECORD GAP value in its receive constraints.",

                "It turns out that filtering witness records based on MIN RECORD GAP is complex.",
                "It requires that the witness records of any given node be arranged in an order sorted by their record time values.",

                "A group can be static, meaning that the group membership does not change over the period of time, or it could be dynamic in which case nodes can leave or join the group.",
                "To make our analysis simple and to explain the advantages of group, we first discuss static groups.",
                "A static group is formed at the start of a hiking trail or ski slope.",
                "Suppose there are five family members who want to go for a hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park.",
                "Before these members start their hike, each one of them is given a sensor node and the information is entered in the system that the five nodes form a group.",
                "Each group member is given a unique id and every group member knows about other members of the group.",
                "The group, as a whole, is also assigned an id to distinguish it from other groups in the system.",
                "Figure 10: A group of five people.",
                "Node 2 is the group leader and it is communicating on behalf of the group with an external node 17.",
                "All other (shown in a lighter shade) are in sleep mode.",
                "As the group moves through the trail, it exchanges information with other nodes or groups that it comes across.",
                "At any point in time, only one group member, called the leader, sends and receives information on behalf of the group and all other n − 1 group members are put in the sleep mode (See Figure 10).",
                "It is this property of groups that saves us energy.",
                "The group leadership is time-multiplexed among the group members.",
                "This is done to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery due to continuous exchange of information.",
                "Thus after every t seconds, the leadership is passed on to another node, called the successor, and the leader (now an ordinary member) is put to sleep.",
                "Since energy is dear, we do not implement an extensive election algorithm for choosing the successor.",
                "Instead, we choose the successor on the basis of node id.",
                "The node with the next highest id in the group is chosen as the successor.",
                "The last node, of course, chooses the node with the lowest id as its successor.",
                "We now discuss the data storage schemes for groups.",
                "Memory is a scarce resource in sensor nodes and it is therefore important that witness information be stored efficiently among group members.",
                "Efficient data storage is not a trivial task when it comes to groups.",
                "The tradeoff is between simplicity of the scheme and memory savings.",
                "A simpler scheme incurs lesser energy cost as compared to a more sophisticated scheme, but offers lesser memory savings as well.",
                "This is because in a more complicated scheme, the group members have to coordinate to update and store information.",
                "After considering a number of different schemes, we have come to a conclusion that there is no optimal storage scheme for groups.",
                "The system should be able to adapt according to its requirements.",
                "If group members are low on battery, then the group can adapt a scheme that is more energy efficient.",
                "Similarly, if the group members are running out of memory, they can adapt a scheme that is more memory efficient.",
                "We first present a simple scheme that is very energy efficient but does not offer significant memory savings.",
                "We then present an alternate scheme that is much more memory efficient.",
                "As already mentioned a group can receive information only through the group leader.",
                "Whenever the leader comes across an external node e, it receives information from that node and saves it.",
                "In our first scheme, when the timeslot for the leader expires, the leader passes this new information it received from e to its successor.",
                "This is important because during the next time slot, if the new leader comes across another external node, it should be able to pass information about all the external nodes this group has witnessed so far.",
                "Thus the information is fully replicated on all nodes to maintain the correct view of the world.",
                "Our first scheme does not offer any memory savings but is highly energy efficient and may be a good choice when the group members are running low on battery.",
                "Except for the time when the leadership is switched, all n − 1 members are asleep at any given time.",
                "This means that a single member is up for t seconds once every n∗t seconds and therefore has to spend approximately only 1/nth of its energy.",
                "Thus, if there are 5 members in a group, we save 80% energy, which is huge.",
                "More energy can be saved by increasing the group size.",
                "We now present an alternate data storage scheme that aims at saving memory at the cost of energy.",
                "In this scheme we divide the group into what we call partitions.",
                "Partitions can be thought of as subgroups within a group.",
                "Each partition must have at least two nodes in it.",
                "The nodes within a partition are called peers.",
                "Each partition has one peer designated as partition leader.",
                "The partition leader stays in receive mode at all times, while all others peers a partition stay in the sleep mode.",
                "Partition leadership is time-multiplexed among the peers to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery.",
                "Like before, a group has exactly one leader and the leadership is time-multiplexed among partitions.",
                "The group leader also serves as the partition leader for the partition it belongs to (See Figure 11).",
                "In this scheme, all partition leaders participate in information exchange.",
                "Whenever a group comes across an external node e, every partition leader receives all witness information, but it only stores a subset of that information after filtering.",
                "Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send witness information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to.",
                "However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode.",
                "Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their witness information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide.",
                "All this is achieved by having the group leader send a signal to every partition leader in turn. 186 Figure 11: The figure shows a group of eight nodes divided into four partitions of 2 nodes each.",
                "Node 1 is the group leader whereas nodes 2, 9, and 7 are partition leaders.",
                "All other nodes are in the sleep mode.",
                "Since the partition leadership is time-multiplexed, it is important that any information received by the partition leader, p1, be passed on to the next leader, p2.",
                "This has to be done to make sure that p2 has all the information that it might need to send when it comes across another external node during its timeslot.",
                "One way of achieving this is to wake p2 up just before p1s timeslot expires and then have p1 transfer information only to p2.",
                "An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers.",
                "Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep.",
                "In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information.",
                "In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes.",
                "In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers.",
                "Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one.",
                "A group can be divided into partitions in more than one way.",
                "For example, suppose we have a group of six members.",
                "We can divide this group into three partitions of two peers each, or two partitions with three peers each.",
                "The choice once again depends on the requirements of the system.",
                "A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient.",
                "This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time.",
                "On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12).",
                "A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery.",
                "This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node.",
                "For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node.",
                "Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all witness information stored in that partition will be lost.",
                "We have devised a very simple protocol to solve this problem.",
                "We first explain how partiFigure 12: The figure shows two different ways of partitioning a group of six nodes.",

                "Suppose node 2 in figure 3 (a) dies.",
                "When node 5, the partition leader, sends information to node 2, it does not receive an acknowledgement from it and concludes that node 2 has died2 .",
                "At this point, node 5 contacts other partition leaders (nodes 1 ... 9) using a broadcast message and informs them that one of its peers has died.",
                "Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of witness information stored in its partition.",
                "Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders.",
                "Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition.",
                "However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition.",
                "It chooses the partition that has the least amount of witness information to join.",
                "It sends its witness information to the new partition leader.",
                "Witness information and membership update is propagated to all peers during the next partition leadership change.",
                "We now consider the case where the partition leader dies.",
                "If this happens, then we wait for the partition leadership to change and for the new partition leader to eventually find out that a peer has died.",
                "Once the new partition leader finds out that it needs more peers, it proceeds with the protocol explained above.",
                "However, in this case, we do lose information that the previous partition leader might have received just before it died.",
                "This problem can be solved by implementing a more rigorous protocol, but we have decided to give up on accuracy to save energy.",
                "Our current design uses time-division multiplexing to schedule wakeup and sleep modes in the sensor nodes.",

                "Since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take 0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34 seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link.",
                "The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh.",
                "Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per hour.",
                "So, average power consumtion due to transmission and reception is (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 mA per hour.",

                "An encounter between two hikers results in exchange of about 50 witness records that takes about 0.68 seconds as calculated above.",

                "This means that the node that generated that record did not have its most up-to-date location at the encounter time.",
                "For example, when hikers 1 and 2 meet at time 16, the last recorded location time of Node Id Record (X,Y) Location Hop Time Time Count 3 78 (12,23) 78 0 3 107 (31,17) 107 0 3 106 (31,17) 106 0 3 76 (12,23) 76 0 3 79 (12,23) 79 0 2 94 (12,23) 79 0 1 16 (?,?) ? 1 1 15 (?,?) ? 1 Table 3: Witness information collected from hiker 3 in indirect inference experiment. hiker 1 is (12,7) recorded at time 6.",
                "So, node 1 generates a witness record with record time 16, location (12,7) and location time 6.",
                "In fact, the last two records in Table 3 have (?,?) as their location.",
                "This has happened because these witness records were generate by hiker 2 during his encounter with 1 at time 15 and 16.",
                "Until this time, hiker 2 hadnt come in contact with any location points.",
                "Interestingly, a more accurate location information of 1 and 2 encounter or 2 and 3 encounter can be computed by process the witness information at the control center.",
                "It took 25 units of time for hiker 1 to go from A (12,7) to B (31,17).",
                "Assuming a constant hiking speed and a relatively straight-line hike, it can be computed that at time 16, hiker 1 must have been at location (18,10).",
                "Thus (18,10) is a more accurate location of encounter between 1 and 2.",
                "Finally, our third experiment called Identifying Hot Search Areas is designed to determine the trail a hiker has taken and identify hot search areas for rescue after he is reported missing.",

                "In our future work, we plan to undertake a major study to address these two concerns. 7.",
                "OTHER APPLICATIONS In addition to the hiking in wilderness areas, CenWits can be used in several other applications, e.g. skiing, climbing, wild life monitoring, and person tracking.",
                "Since CenWits relies only on intermittent connectivity, it can take advantage of the existing cheap and mature technologies, and thereby make tracking cheaper and fairly accurate.",
                "Since CenWits doesnt rely on keeping track of a sensor holder all time, but relies on maintaining witnesses, the system is relatively cheaper and widely applicable.",
                "For example, there are some dangerous cliffs in most ski resorts.",
                "But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain.",
                "Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries.",
                "These boundary sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff.",
                "Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs.",
                "If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier.",
                "If there is no witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.",
                "In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals.",
                "To collect data, either a <br>satellite transmitter</br> is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver.",
                "GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2].",
                "Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds.",
                "Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it.",
                "Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of deers.",
                "CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces.",
                "CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case.",
                "Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data.",
                "In fact, the access points need not be statically located.",
                "They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.",
                "In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesnt work indoor and near skyscrapers.",
                "If a person A is reported missing, and from the witness records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 8.",
                "DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new search and rescue system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current search and rescue systems.",
                "These advantages include a looselycoupled system that relies only on intermittent network connectivity, power and storage efficiency, and low cost.",
                "It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
                "It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies.",
                "A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.",
                "In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.",
                "An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.",
                "This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.",
                "We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.",
                "While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system.",
                "We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present.",
                "Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.",
                "There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.",
                "For example, an adversary can sniff the witness information to locate endangered animals, females, children, etc.",
                "He may inject false information in the system.",
                "An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.",
                "In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.",
                "So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.",
                "However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.",
                "Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.",
                "In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.",
                "Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.",
                "So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.",
                "Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment.",
                "In particular, discussions are currenly underway to deploy CenWits in the Rocky Mountain and Yosemite National Parks. 9.",

                "CenWits uses several small, commonly-available RF-based sensors, and a small number of storage and processing devices.",
                "It is designed for search and rescue of people in emergency situations in wilderness areas.",
                "A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation.",
                "It is designed for an intermittently connected network that provides only occasional connectivity.",
                "It makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "A prototype of CenWits has been implemented using Berkeley Mica2 motes.",

                "INTRODUCTION Search and rescue of people in emergency situation in a timely manner is an extremely important service.",
                "It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation.",
                "With the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc.",
                "All these systems require a connected network via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices.",
                "This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.",
                "For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.",
                "As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.",
                "While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.",
                "Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car.",
                "An RF transmitter has a relatively smaller range of transmission.",
                "So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area.",
                "In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.",
                "In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.",
                "In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).",
                "CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors.",
                "A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location.",
                "The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world.",
                "This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.",
                "In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.",
                "In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network.",
                "Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network.",
                "As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.",
                "Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective.",
                "A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.",
                "The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions.",
                "Groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.",
                "Using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information.",
                "In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.",
                "Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.",
                "It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.",
                "This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors.",
                "The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.",

                "However, they are not 183 an essential requirement of CenWits.",
                "If an LP runs out of power, the CenWits will continue to work correctly.",
                "Figure 5: GPS receiver not working correctly.",
                "Sensors then have to rely on LP to provide coordination In Figure 5, B cannot get GPS reception due to bad weather.",
                "It then runs into A on the trail who doesnt have GPS reception either.",
                "Their sensors record the presence of each other.",
                "After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A.",
                "When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter location of A and B.",
                "By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be inferred.",
                "Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).",
                "Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.",
                "CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.",
                "Such a synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available.",
                "In addition, sensor nodes in CenWits synchronize their clocks whenever they are in the range of an AP or an LP.",
                "The Figure 8: Based on overlapping landscape, B might have hiked to wrong branch and fallen off a cliff.",
                "Hot rescue areas can thus be determined synchronization accuracy Cenwits needs is of the order of a second or so.",
                "As long as the clocks are synchronized with in one second range, whether A met B at 12:3745 or 12:3746 doesnt matter in the ordering of <br>witness</br> events and inferring the path. 4.",
                "MEMORY AND POWER MANAGEMENT CenWits employs several important mechanisms to conserve power and memory.",
                "It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory.",
                "With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of <br>witness</br> information stored at a node can get very large.",
                "This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of <br>witness</br> information over time.",
                "To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically.",
                "This raises an interesting question of when and which <br>witness</br> record should be deleted from the memory of a node?",
                "CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap.",
                "Record count refers to the number of <br>witness</br> records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT.",

                "Every <br>witness</br> record has a hop count field that stores the number times (hops) this record has been transferred since being created.",
                "Initially this field is set to 0.",
                "Whenever a node receives a <br>witness</br> record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "It keeps only those <br>witness</br> records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a <br>witness</br> record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a <br>witness</br> record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.",
                "We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet.",
                "The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up.",
                "For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes.",
                "On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node.",
                "Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two <br>witness</br> records with the same node id.",
                "To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two <br>witness</br> records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP.",

                "When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory.",

                "Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its <br>witness</br> information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions.",
                "For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a beacon every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour.",
                "However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a beacon should be emitted every 10 seconds.",
                "If a user is not moving at all, a beacon can be emitted every 10 minutes.",
                "In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time.",
                "If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy.",
                "In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals.",
                "For example, suppose hiker A has communicated its <br>witness</br> information to three other hikers in the last five minutes.",
                "If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional <br>witness</br> information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to sleep mode if it is extremely low on power.",
                "The bandwidth and energy limitations of sensor nodes require that the amount of data transferred among the nodes be reduced to minimum.",
                "It has been observed that in some scenarios 3000 instructions could be executed for the same energy cost of sending a bit 100m by radio [15].",

                "To make our analysis simple and to explain the advantages of group, we first discuss static groups.",
                "A static group is formed at the start of a hiking trail or ski slope.",

                "Each group member is given a unique id and every group member knows about other members of the group.",
                "The group, as a whole, is also assigned an id to distinguish it from other groups in the system.",

                "Node 2 is the group leader and it is communicating on behalf of the group with an external node 17.",
                "All other (shown in a lighter shade) are in sleep mode.",
                "As the group moves through the trail, it exchanges information with other nodes or groups that it comes across.",
                "At any point in time, only one group member, called the leader, sends and receives information on behalf of the group and all other n − 1 group members are put in the sleep mode (See Figure 10).",
                "It is this property of groups that saves us energy.",
                "The group leadership is time-multiplexed among the group members.",
                "This is done to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery due to continuous exchange of information.",
                "Thus after every t seconds, the leadership is passed on to another node, called the successor, and the leader (now an ordinary member) is put to sleep.",
                "Since energy is dear, we do not implement an extensive election algorithm for choosing the successor.",
                "Instead, we choose the successor on the basis of node id.",

                "A simpler scheme incurs lesser energy cost as compared to a more sophisticated scheme, but offers lesser memory savings as well.",
                "This is because in a more complicated scheme, the group members have to coordinate to update and store information.",
                "After considering a number of different schemes, we have come to a conclusion that there is no optimal storage scheme for groups.",
                "The system should be able to adapt according to its requirements.",
                "If group members are low on battery, then the group can adapt a scheme that is more energy efficient.",
                "Similarly, if the group members are running out of memory, they can adapt a scheme that is more memory efficient.",
                "We first present a simple scheme that is very energy efficient but does not offer significant memory savings.",
                "We then present an alternate scheme that is much more memory efficient.",
                "As already mentioned a group can receive information only through the group leader.",
                "Whenever the leader comes across an external node e, it receives information from that node and saves it.",
                "In our first scheme, when the timeslot for the leader expires, the leader passes this new information it received from e to its successor.",
                "This is important because during the next time slot, if the new leader comes across another external node, it should be able to pass information about all the external nodes this group has witnessed so far.",
                "Thus the information is fully replicated on all nodes to maintain the correct view of the world.",
                "Our first scheme does not offer any memory savings but is highly energy efficient and may be a good choice when the group members are running low on battery.",
                "Except for the time when the leadership is switched, all n − 1 members are asleep at any given time.",
                "This means that a single member is up for t seconds once every n∗t seconds and therefore has to spend approximately only 1/nth of its energy.",
                "Thus, if there are 5 members in a group, we save 80% energy, which is huge.",
                "More energy can be saved by increasing the group size.",
                "We now present an alternate data storage scheme that aims at saving memory at the cost of energy.",
                "In this scheme we divide the group into what we call partitions.",
                "Partitions can be thought of as subgroups within a group.",
                "Each partition must have at least two nodes in it.",
                "The nodes within a partition are called peers.",
                "Each partition has one peer designated as partition leader.",
                "The partition leader stays in receive mode at all times, while all others peers a partition stay in the sleep mode.",
                "Partition leadership is time-multiplexed among the peers to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery.",
                "Like before, a group has exactly one leader and the leadership is time-multiplexed among partitions.",
                "The group leader also serves as the partition leader for the partition it belongs to (See Figure 11).",
                "In this scheme, all partition leaders participate in information exchange.",
                "Whenever a group comes across an external node e, every partition leader receives all <br>witness</br> information, but it only stores a subset of that information after filtering.",
                "Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send <br>witness</br> information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to.",
                "However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode.",
                "Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their <br>witness</br> information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide.",
                "All this is achieved by having the group leader send a signal to every partition leader in turn. 186 Figure 11: The figure shows a group of eight nodes divided into four partitions of 2 nodes each.",
                "Node 1 is the group leader whereas nodes 2, 9, and 7 are partition leaders.",
                "All other nodes are in the sleep mode.",
                "Since the partition leadership is time-multiplexed, it is important that any information received by the partition leader, p1, be passed on to the next leader, p2.",
                "This has to be done to make sure that p2 has all the information that it might need to send when it comes across another external node during its timeslot.",
                "One way of achieving this is to wake p2 up just before p1s timeslot expires and then have p1 transfer information only to p2.",
                "An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers.",
                "Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep.",
                "In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information.",
                "In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes.",
                "In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers.",
                "Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one.",
                "A group can be divided into partitions in more than one way.",
                "For example, suppose we have a group of six members.",
                "We can divide this group into three partitions of two peers each, or two partitions with three peers each.",
                "The choice once again depends on the requirements of the system.",
                "A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient.",
                "This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time.",
                "On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12).",
                "A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery.",
                "This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node.",
                "For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node.",
                "Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all <br>witness</br> information stored in that partition will be lost.",
                "We have devised a very simple protocol to solve this problem.",

                "At this point, node 5 contacts other partition leaders (nodes 1 ... 9) using a broadcast message and informs them that one of its peers has died.",
                "Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of <br>witness</br> information stored in its partition.",
                "Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders.",
                "Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition.",
                "However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition.",
                "It chooses the partition that has the least amount of <br>witness</br> information to join.",

                "<br>witness</br> information and membership update is propagated to all peers during the next partition leadership change.",
                "We now consider the case where the partition leader dies.",
                "If this happens, then we wait for the partition leadership to change and for the new partition leader to eventually find out that a peer has died.",
                "Once the new partition leader finds out that it needs more peers, it proceeds with the protocol explained above.",
                "However, in this case, we do lose information that the previous partition leader might have received just before it died.",

                "The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh.",

                "But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain.",
                "Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries.",
                "These boundary sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff.",
                "Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs.",
                "If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the <br>witness</br> record of the skier.",
                "If there is no <br>witness</br> record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.",
                "In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals.",
                "To collect data, either a satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver.",
                "GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2].",
                "Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds.",
                "Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it.",
                "Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of deers.",
                "CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces.",
                "CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case.",
                "Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data.",
                "In fact, the access points need not be statically located.",
                "They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.",
                "In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesnt work indoor and near skyscrapers.",
                "If a person A is reported missing, and from the <br>witness</br> records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 8.",
                "DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new search and rescue system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current search and rescue systems.",
                "These advantages include a looselycoupled system that relies only on intermittent network connectivity, power and storage efficiency, and low cost.",
                "It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
                "It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies.",
                "A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.",
                "In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.",
                "An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.",
                "This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.",
                "We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.",
                "While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system.",
                "We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present.",
                "Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.",
                "There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.",
                "For example, an adversary can sniff the <br>witness</br> information to locate endangered animals, females, children, etc.",
                "He may inject false information in the system.",
                "An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.",
                "In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.",
                "So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.",
                "However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.",
                "Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.",
                "In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.",
                "Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.",
                "So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.",
                "Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment.",

                "CenWits uses several small, commonly-available RF-based sensors, and a small number of storage and processing devices.",
                "It is designed for search and rescue of people in emergency situations in wilderness areas.",
                "A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation.",
                "It is designed for an intermittently connected network that provides only occasional connectivity.",
                "It makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and <br>intermittent network connectivity</br> to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "A prototype of CenWits has been implemented using Berkeley Mica2 motes.",
                "The paper describes this implementation and reports on the performance measured from it.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Computer-Communication Networks]: Distributed Systems General Terms Algorithms, Design, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Search and rescue of people in emergency situation in a timely manner is an extremely important service.",
                "It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation.",
                "With the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc.",
                "All these systems require a connected network via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices.",
                "This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.",
                "For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.",
                "As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.",
                "While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.",
                "Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car.",
                "An RF transmitter has a relatively smaller range of transmission.",
                "So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area.",
                "In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.",
                "In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.",
                "In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).",
                "CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors.",
                "A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location.",
                "The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world.",
                "This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.",
                "In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.",
                "In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and <br>intermittent network connectivity</br> to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network.",
                "Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network.",
                "As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.",
                "Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective.",
                "A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.",
                "The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions.",
                "Groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.",
                "Using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information.",
                "In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.",
                "Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.",
                "It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.",
                "This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors.",
                "The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.",
                "However, these techniques are quite general.",
                "We discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques.",
                "While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.",
                "First, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not require a connected network.",
                "Second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization.",
                "Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we overview some of the recent projects and technologies related to movement and location tracking, and search and rescue systems.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the overall architecture of CenWits, and provide a high-level description of its functionality.",
                "In the next section, Section 4, we discuss power and memory management in CenWits.",
                "To simplify our presentation, we will focus on a specific application of tracking lost/injured hikers in all these sections.",
                "In Section 6, we describe a prototype implementation of CenWits and present performance measured from this implementation.",
                "We discuss how the ideas of CenWits can be used to build several other applications in Section 7.",
                "Finally, in Section 8, we discuss some related issues and conclude the paper. 2.",

                "After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A.",
                "When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter location of A and B.",
                "By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be inferred.",
                "Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).",
                "Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.",
                "CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.",
                "Such a synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available.",
                "In addition, sensor nodes in CenWits synchronize their clocks whenever they are in the range of an AP or an LP.",

                "As long as the clocks are synchronized with in one second range, whether A met B at 12:3745 or 12:3746 doesnt matter in the ordering of witness events and inferring the path. 4.",
                "MEMORY AND POWER MANAGEMENT CenWits employs several important mechanisms to conserve power and memory.",
                "It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory.",
                "With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of witness information stored at a node can get very large.",
                "This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of witness information over time.",
                "To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically.",
                "This raises an interesting question of when and which witness record should be deleted from the memory of a node?",
                "CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap.",
                "Record count refers to the number of witness records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT.",
                "It stores at most MAX RECORD COUNT witness records of any node.",
                "Every witness record has a hop count field that stores the number times (hops) this record has been transferred since being created.",
                "Initially this field is set to 0.",
                "Whenever a node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.",
                "We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet.",
                "The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up.",
                "For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes.",
                "On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node.",
                "Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two witness records with the same node id.",
                "To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two witness records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "For each node id i, n stores the witness record with the most recent record time rti, the witness with most recent record time that is at least MIN RECORD GAP time units before rti, and so on until the record count limit (MAX RECORD COUNT) is reached.",
                "When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory.",
                "It decrements MAX RECORD COUNT and MAX HOP COUNT, and increments MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "It then first erases all witness records whose hop count exceeds the reduced MAX HOP COUNT value, and then erases witness records to satisfy the record gap criteria.",
                "Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its witness information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions.",
                "For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a beacon every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour.",
                "However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a beacon should be emitted every 10 seconds.",
                "If a user is not moving at all, a beacon can be emitted every 10 minutes.",
                "In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time.",
                "If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy.",
                "In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals.",
                "For example, suppose hiker A has communicated its witness information to three other hikers in the last five minutes.",
                "If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional witness information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to sleep mode if it is extremely low on power.",
                "The bandwidth and energy limitations of sensor nodes require that the amount of data transferred among the nodes be reduced to minimum.",
                "It has been observed that in some scenarios 3000 instructions could be executed for the same energy cost of sending a bit 100m by radio [15].",
                "To reduce the amount of data transfer, CenWits employs a handshake protocol that two nodes execute when they encounter one another.",
                "The goal of this protocol is to ensure that a node transmits only as much witness information as the other node is willing to receive.",
                "This protocol is initiated when a node i receives a beacon containing the node ID of the sender node j and i has not exchanged witness information with j in the last δ time units.",
                "Assume that i < j.",

                "In the most general case, they are comprised of the three parameters (record count, hop count and record gap) used for memory management.",
                "If i is low on memory, it specifies the maximum number of records it is willing to accept from j.",
                "Similarly, i can ask j to send only those records that have hop count value less than MAX HOP COUNT − 1.",
                "Finally, i can include its MIN RECORD GAP value in its receive constraints.",
                "Note that the handshake protocol is beneficial to both i and j.",
                "They save memory by receiving only as much information as they are willing to accept and conserve energy by sending only as many witness records as needed.",
                "It turns out that filtering witness records based on MIN RECORD GAP is complex.",
                "It requires that the witness records of any given node be arranged in an order sorted by their record time values.",
                "Maintaining this sorted order is complex in memory, because new witness records with the same node id can arrive later that may have to be inserted in between to preserve the sorted order.",
                "For this reason, the receive constraints in the current CenWits prototype do not include record gap.",
                "Suppose i specifies a hop count value of 3.",

                "If the hop count value is greater than 3, the record is not transmitted. 4.3 Groups and Partitions To further reduce communication and increase the lifetime of our system, we introduce the notion of groups.",
                "The idea is based on the concept of abstract regions presented in [20].",
                "A group is a set of n nodes that can be defined in terms of radio connectivity, geographic location, or other properties of nodes.",

                "At any point in time, a group has exactly one leader that communicates 185 with external nodes on behalf of the entire group.",
                "A group can be static, meaning that the group membership does not change over the period of time, or it could be dynamic in which case nodes can leave or join the group.",

                "Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send witness information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to.",
                "However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode.",
                "Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their witness information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide.",

                "One way of achieving this is to wake p2 up just before p1s timeslot expires and then have p1 transfer information only to p2.",
                "An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers.",
                "Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep.",
                "In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information.",
                "In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes.",
                "In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers.",
                "Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one.",

                "A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient.",
                "This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time.",
                "On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12).",
                "A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery.",
                "This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node.",
                "For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node.",
                "Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all witness information stored in that partition will be lost.",
                "We have devised a very simple protocol to solve this problem.",

                "When node 5, the partition leader, sends information to node 2, it does not receive an acknowledgement from it and concludes that node 2 has died2 .",
                "At this point, node 5 contacts other partition leaders (nodes 1 ... 9) using a broadcast message and informs them that one of its peers has died.",
                "Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of witness information stored in its partition.",
                "Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders.",
                "Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition.",
                "However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition.",
                "It chooses the partition that has the least amount of witness information to join.",
                "It sends its witness information to the new partition leader.",
                "Witness information and membership update is propagated to all peers during the next partition leadership change.",
                "We now consider the case where the partition leader dies.",
                "If this happens, then we wait for the partition leadership to change and for the new partition leader to eventually find out that a peer has died.",
                "Once the new partition leader finds out that it needs more peers, it proceeds with the protocol explained above.",
                "However, in this case, we do lose information that the previous partition leader might have received just before it died.",
                "This problem can be solved by implementing a more rigorous protocol, but we have decided to give up on accuracy to save energy.",

                "Since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take 0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34 seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link.",
                "The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh.",
                "Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per hour.",
                "So, average power consumtion due to transmission and reception is (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 mA per hour.",

                "An encounter between two hikers results in exchange of about 50 witness records that takes about 0.68 seconds as calculated above.",
                "Thus, a single alkaline battery can last for (159 ∗ 60 ∗ 60)/0.68 = 841764 hiker encounters.",
                "Assuming that a node emits a beacon every 90 seconds and a hiker encounter occurs everytime a beacon is emitted (worst-case scenario), a single alkaline battery will last for (841764 ∗ 90)/(30 ∗ 24 ∗ 60 ∗ 60) = 29 days.",
                "Since, a Mica2 is equipped with two batteries, a Mica2 sensor can remain operation for about two months.",

                "Our experiments did not generate enough data to test the impact of record count or hop count criteria.",
                "To evaluate the impact of these criteria, we simulated CenWits to generate a significantly large number of records for a given number of hikers and access points.",
                "We generated witness records by having the hikers walk randomly.",
                "We applied the three criteria to measure the amount of memory savings in a sensor node.",
                "The results are shown in Table 4.",
                "The number of hikers in this simulation was 10 and the number of access points was 5.",
                "The number of witness records reported in this table is an average number of witness records a sensor node stored at the time of dump to an access point.",
                "These results show that the three memory management criteria significantly reduces the memory consumption of sensor nodes in CenWits.",
                "For example, they can reduce MAX MIN MAX # of RECORD RECORD HOP Witness COUNT GAP COUNT Records 5 5 5 628 4 5 5 421 3 5 5 316 5 10 5 311 5 20 5 207 5 5 4 462 5 5 3 341 3 20 3 161 Table 4: Impact of memory management techniques. the memory consumption by up to 75%.",
                "However, these results are premature at present for two reasons: (1) They are generated via simulation of hikers walking at random; and (2) It is not clear what impact the erasing of witness records has on the accuracy of inferred location/hot search areas of lost hikers.",
                "In our future work, we plan to undertake a major study to address these two concerns. 7.",
                "OTHER APPLICATIONS In addition to the hiking in wilderness areas, CenWits can be used in several other applications, e.g. skiing, climbing, wild life monitoring, and person tracking.",
                "Since CenWits relies only on intermittent connectivity, it can take advantage of the existing cheap and mature technologies, and thereby make tracking cheaper and fairly accurate.",
                "Since CenWits doesnt rely on keeping track of a sensor holder all time, but relies on maintaining witnesses, the system is relatively cheaper and widely applicable.",
                "For example, there are some dangerous cliffs in most ski resorts.",
                "But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain.",
                "Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries.",
                "These boundary sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff.",
                "Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs.",
                "If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier.",
                "If there is no witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.",
                "In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals.",
                "To collect data, either a satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver.",
                "GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2].",
                "Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds.",
                "Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it.",
                "Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of deers.",
                "CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces.",
                "CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case.",
                "Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data.",
                "In fact, the access points need not be statically located.",
                "They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.",
                "In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesnt work indoor and near skyscrapers.",
                "If a person A is reported missing, and from the witness records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 8.",
                "DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new search and rescue system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current search and rescue systems.",
                "These advantages include a looselycoupled system that relies only on <br>intermittent network connectivity</br>, power and storage efficiency, and low cost.",
                "It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
                "It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies.",
                "A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.",
                "In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.",
                "An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.",
                "This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.",
                "We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.",
                "While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system.",
                "We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present.",
                "Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.",
                "There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.",
                "For example, an adversary can sniff the witness information to locate endangered animals, females, children, etc.",
                "He may inject false information in the system.",
                "An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.",
                "In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.",
                "So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.",
                "However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.",
                "Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.",
                "In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.",
                "Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.",
                "So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.",
                "Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment.",
                "In particular, discussions are currenly underway to deploy CenWits in the Rocky Mountain and Yosemite National Parks. 9.",

                "CenWits uses several small, commonly-available RF-based sensors, and a small number of storage and processing devices.",
                "It is designed for search and rescue of people in emergency situations in wilderness areas.",
                "A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation.",
                "It is designed for an intermittently connected network that provides only occasional connectivity.",
                "It makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "A prototype of CenWits has been implemented using Berkeley Mica2 motes.",

                "INTRODUCTION Search and rescue of people in emergency situation in a timely manner is an extremely important service.",
                "It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation.",
                "With the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc.",
                "All these systems require a connected network via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices.",
                "This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.",
                "For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.",
                "As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.",
                "While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.",
                "Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car.",
                "An RF transmitter has a relatively smaller range of transmission.",
                "So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area.",
                "In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.",
                "In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.",
                "In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).",
                "CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors.",
                "A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location.",
                "The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world.",
                "This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.",
                "In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.",
                "In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network.",
                "Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network.",
                "As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.",
                "Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective.",
                "A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.",
                "The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of <br>groups and partitions</br>.",
                "<br>groups and partitions</br> allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.",
                "Using <br>groups and partitions</br>, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information.",
                "In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.",
                "Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.",
                "It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.",
                "This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors.",
                "The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.",
                "However, these techniques are quite general.",
                "We discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques.",
                "While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.",
                "First, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not require a connected network.",
                "Second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization.",
                "Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we overview some of the recent projects and technologies related to movement and location tracking, and search and rescue systems.",

                "In the next section, Section 4, we discuss power and memory management in CenWits.",
                "To simplify our presentation, we will focus on a specific application of tracking lost/injured hikers in all these sections.",
                "In Section 6, we describe a prototype implementation of CenWits and present performance measured from this implementation.",
                "We discuss how the ideas of CenWits can be used to build several other applications in Section 7.",
                "Finally, in Section 8, we discuss some related issues and conclude the paper. 2.",

                "Their sensors record the presence of each other.",
                "After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A.",
                "When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter location of A and B.",
                "By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be inferred.",
                "Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).",
                "Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.",
                "CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.",
                "Such a synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available.",
                "In addition, sensor nodes in CenWits synchronize their clocks whenever they are in the range of an AP or an LP.",

                "As long as the clocks are synchronized with in one second range, whether A met B at 12:3745 or 12:3746 doesnt matter in the ordering of witness events and inferring the path. 4.",
                "MEMORY AND POWER MANAGEMENT CenWits employs several important mechanisms to conserve power and memory.",
                "It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory.",
                "With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of witness information stored at a node can get very large.",
                "This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of witness information over time.",
                "To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically.",
                "This raises an interesting question of when and which witness record should be deleted from the memory of a node?",
                "CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap.",
                "Record count refers to the number of witness records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT.",
                "It stores at most MAX RECORD COUNT witness records of any node.",

                "Initially this field is set to 0.",
                "Whenever a node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.",
                "We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet.",
                "The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up.",
                "For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes.",
                "On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node.",
                "Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two witness records with the same node id.",
                "To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two witness records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "For each node id i, n stores the witness record with the most recent record time rti, the witness with most recent record time that is at least MIN RECORD GAP time units before rti, and so on until the record count limit (MAX RECORD COUNT) is reached.",
                "When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory.",
                "It decrements MAX RECORD COUNT and MAX HOP COUNT, and increments MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "It then first erases all witness records whose hop count exceeds the reduced MAX HOP COUNT value, and then erases witness records to satisfy the record gap criteria.",
                "Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its witness information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions.",
                "For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a beacon every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour.",
                "However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a beacon should be emitted every 10 seconds.",
                "If a user is not moving at all, a beacon can be emitted every 10 minutes.",
                "In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time.",
                "If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy.",
                "In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals.",
                "For example, suppose hiker A has communicated its witness information to three other hikers in the last five minutes.",
                "If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional witness information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to sleep mode if it is extremely low on power.",
                "The bandwidth and energy limitations of sensor nodes require that the amount of data transferred among the nodes be reduced to minimum.",
                "It has been observed that in some scenarios 3000 instructions could be executed for the same energy cost of sending a bit 100m by radio [15].",
                "To reduce the amount of data transfer, CenWits employs a handshake protocol that two nodes execute when they encounter one another.",
                "The goal of this protocol is to ensure that a node transmits only as much witness information as the other node is willing to receive.",
                "This protocol is initiated when a node i receives a beacon containing the node ID of the sender node j and i has not exchanged witness information with j in the last δ time units.",

                "In the most general case, they are comprised of the three parameters (record count, hop count and record gap) used for memory management.",
                "If i is low on memory, it specifies the maximum number of records it is willing to accept from j.",
                "Similarly, i can ask j to send only those records that have hop count value less than MAX HOP COUNT − 1.",
                "Finally, i can include its MIN RECORD GAP value in its receive constraints.",
                "Note that the handshake protocol is beneficial to both i and j.",
                "They save memory by receiving only as much information as they are willing to accept and conserve energy by sending only as many witness records as needed.",
                "It turns out that filtering witness records based on MIN RECORD GAP is complex.",
                "It requires that the witness records of any given node be arranged in an order sorted by their record time values.",
                "Maintaining this sorted order is complex in memory, because new witness records with the same node id can arrive later that may have to be inserted in between to preserve the sorted order.",
                "For this reason, the receive constraints in the current CenWits prototype do not include record gap.",

                "Whenever a group comes across an external node e, every partition leader receives all witness information, but it only stores a subset of that information after filtering.",
                "Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send witness information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to.",
                "However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode.",
                "Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their witness information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide.",
                "All this is achieved by having the group leader send a signal to every partition leader in turn. 186 Figure 11: The figure shows a group of eight nodes divided into four partitions of 2 nodes each.",

                "An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers.",
                "Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep.",
                "In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information.",
                "In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes.",
                "In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers.",
                "Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one.",

                "A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient.",
                "This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time.",
                "On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12).",
                "A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery.",
                "This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node.",
                "For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node.",
                "Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all witness information stored in that partition will be lost.",

                "When node 5, the partition leader, sends information to node 2, it does not receive an acknowledgement from it and concludes that node 2 has died2 .",
                "At this point, node 5 contacts other partition leaders (nodes 1 ... 9) using a broadcast message and informs them that one of its peers has died.",
                "Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of witness information stored in its partition.",
                "Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders.",
                "Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition.",
                "However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition.",
                "It chooses the partition that has the least amount of witness information to join.",
                "It sends its witness information to the new partition leader.",
                "Witness information and membership update is propagated to all peers during the next partition leadership change.",
                "We now consider the case where the partition leader dies.",
                "If this happens, then we wait for the partition leadership to change and for the new partition leader to eventually find out that a peer has died.",
                "Once the new partition leader finds out that it needs more peers, it proceeds with the protocol explained above.",
                "However, in this case, we do lose information that the previous partition leader might have received just before it died.",
                "This problem can be solved by implementing a more rigorous protocol, but we have decided to give up on accuracy to save energy.",

                "Since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take 0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34 seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link.",
                "The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh.",
                "Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per hour.",
                "So, average power consumtion due to transmission and reception is (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 mA per hour.",

                "An encounter between two hikers results in exchange of about 50 witness records that takes about 0.68 seconds as calculated above.",

                "Similarly, the witness records generated by 1 at record times 10, 15 and 16 (see Table 1) have all been generated due a single contact between access point A and node 1.",

                "In our future work, we plan to undertake a major study to address these two concerns. 7.",
                "OTHER APPLICATIONS In addition to the hiking in wilderness areas, CenWits can be used in several other applications, e.g. skiing, climbing, wild life monitoring, and person tracking.",
                "Since CenWits relies only on intermittent connectivity, it can take advantage of the existing cheap and mature technologies, and thereby make tracking cheaper and fairly accurate.",
                "Since CenWits doesnt rely on keeping track of a sensor holder all time, but relies on maintaining witnesses, the system is relatively cheaper and widely applicable.",
                "For example, there are some dangerous cliffs in most ski resorts.",
                "But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain.",
                "Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries.",
                "These boundary sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff.",
                "Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs.",
                "If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier.",
                "If there is no witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.",
                "In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals.",
                "To collect data, either a satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver.",
                "GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2].",
                "Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds.",
                "Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it.",
                "Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of deers.",
                "CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces.",
                "CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case.",
                "Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data.",
                "In fact, the access points need not be statically located.",
                "They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.",
                "In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesnt work indoor and near skyscrapers.",
                "If a person A is reported missing, and from the witness records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 8.",
                "DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new search and rescue system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current search and rescue systems.",
                "These advantages include a looselycoupled system that relies only on intermittent network connectivity, power and storage efficiency, and low cost.",
                "It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
                "It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies.",
                "A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.",
                "In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.",
                "An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.",
                "This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.",
                "We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.",
                "While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system.",
                "We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present.",
                "Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.",
                "There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.",
                "For example, an adversary can sniff the witness information to locate endangered animals, females, children, etc.",
                "He may inject false information in the system.",
                "An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.",
                "In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.",
                "So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.",
                "However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.",
                "Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.",
                "In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.",
                "Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.",
                "So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.",
                "Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment.",
                "In particular, discussions are currenly underway to deploy CenWits in the Rocky Mountain and Yosemite National Parks. 9.",

                "CenWits uses several small, commonly-available RF-based sensors, and a small number of storage and processing devices.",
                "It is designed for search and rescue of people in emergency situations in wilderness areas.",
                "A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation.",
                "It is designed for an intermittently connected network that provides only occasional connectivity.",
                "It makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",

                "INTRODUCTION Search and rescue of people in emergency situation in a timely manner is an extremely important service.",
                "It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation.",
                "With the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc.",
                "All these systems require a connected network via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices.",
                "This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.",
                "For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.",
                "As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.",
                "While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.",
                "Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car.",
                "An RF transmitter has a relatively smaller range of transmission.",
                "So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area.",
                "In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.",
                "In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.",
                "In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).",
                "CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors.",
                "A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location.",
                "The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world.",
                "This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.",
                "In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.",
                "In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network.",
                "Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network.",
                "As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.",
                "Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective.",
                "A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.",
                "The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions.",
                "Groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.",
                "Using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information.",
                "In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.",
                "Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.",
                "It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.",
                "This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors.",
                "The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.",
                "However, these techniques are quite general.",
                "We discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques.",
                "While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.",
                "First, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not require a connected network.",
                "Second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization.",
                "Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",

                "After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A.",
                "When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter location of A and B.",
                "By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be inferred.",
                "Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).",
                "Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.",
                "CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.",
                "Such a synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available.",
                "In addition, sensor nodes in CenWits synchronize their clocks whenever they are in the range of an AP or an LP.",

                "As long as the clocks are synchronized with in one second range, whether A met B at 12:3745 or 12:3746 doesnt matter in the ordering of witness events and inferring the path. 4.",
                "MEMORY AND POWER MANAGEMENT CenWits employs several important mechanisms to conserve power and memory.",
                "It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory.",
                "With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of witness information stored at a node can get very large.",
                "This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of witness information over time.",
                "To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically.",
                "This raises an interesting question of when and which witness record should be deleted from the memory of a node?",
                "CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap.",
                "Record count refers to the number of witness records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT.",
                "It stores at most MAX RECORD COUNT witness records of any node.",

                "Initially this field is set to 0.",
                "Whenever a node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.",
                "We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet.",
                "The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up.",
                "For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes.",
                "On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node.",
                "Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two witness records with the same node id.",
                "To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two witness records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "For each node id i, n stores the witness record with the most recent record time rti, the witness with most recent record time that is at least MIN RECORD GAP time units before rti, and so on until the record count limit (MAX RECORD COUNT) is reached.",
                "When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory.",
                "It decrements MAX RECORD COUNT and MAX HOP COUNT, and increments MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "It then first erases all witness records whose hop count exceeds the reduced MAX HOP COUNT value, and then erases witness records to satisfy the record gap criteria.",
                "Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its witness information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions.",
                "For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a beacon every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour.",
                "However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a beacon should be emitted every 10 seconds.",
                "If a user is not moving at all, a beacon can be emitted every 10 minutes.",
                "In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time.",
                "If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy.",
                "In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals.",
                "For example, suppose hiker A has communicated its witness information to three other hikers in the last five minutes.",
                "If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional witness information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to sleep mode if it is extremely low on power.",
                "The bandwidth and energy limitations of sensor nodes require that the amount of data transferred among the nodes be reduced to minimum.",
                "It has been observed that in some scenarios 3000 instructions could be executed for the same energy cost of sending a bit 100m by radio [15].",
                "To reduce the amount of data transfer, CenWits employs a handshake protocol that two nodes execute when they encounter one another.",
                "The goal of this protocol is to ensure that a node transmits only as much witness information as the other node is willing to receive.",
                "This protocol is initiated when a node i receives a beacon containing the node ID of the sender node j and i has not exchanged witness information with j in the last δ time units.",

                "If i is low on memory, it specifies the maximum number of records it is willing to accept from j.",

                "It turns out that filtering witness records based on MIN RECORD GAP is complex.",
                "It requires that the witness records of any given node be arranged in an order sorted by their record time values.",

                "If the hop count value is greater than 3, the record is not transmitted. 4.3 Groups and Partitions To further reduce communication and increase the lifetime of our system, we introduce the notion of groups.",
                "The idea is based on the concept of abstract regions presented in [20].",
                "A group is a set of n nodes that can be defined in terms of radio connectivity, geographic location, or other properties of nodes.",
                "All nodes within a group can communicate directly with one another and they share information to maintain their view of the external world.",
                "At any point in time, a group has exactly one leader that communicates 185 with external nodes on behalf of the entire group.",
                "A group can be static, meaning that the group membership does not change over the period of time, or it could be dynamic in which case nodes can leave or join the group.",
                "To make our analysis simple and to explain the advantages of group, we first discuss static groups.",
                "A static group is formed at the start of a hiking trail or ski slope.",
                "Suppose there are five family members who want to go for a hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park.",
                "Before these members start their hike, each one of them is given a sensor node and the information is entered in the system that the five nodes form a group.",
                "Each group member is given a unique id and every group member knows about other members of the group.",
                "The group, as a whole, is also assigned an id to distinguish it from other groups in the system.",
                "Figure 10: A group of five people.",
                "Node 2 is the group leader and it is communicating on behalf of the group with an external node 17.",
                "All other (shown in a lighter shade) are in sleep mode.",
                "As the group moves through the trail, it exchanges information with other nodes or groups that it comes across.",
                "At any point in time, only one group member, called the leader, sends and receives information on behalf of the group and all other n − 1 group members are put in the sleep mode (See Figure 10).",
                "It is this property of groups that saves us energy.",
                "The group leadership is time-multiplexed among the group members.",
                "This is done to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery due to continuous exchange of information.",
                "Thus after every t seconds, the leadership is passed on to another node, called the successor, and the leader (now an ordinary member) is put to sleep.",
                "Since energy is dear, we do not implement an extensive election algorithm for choosing the successor.",
                "Instead, we choose the successor on the basis of node id.",
                "The node with the next highest id in the group is chosen as the successor.",
                "The last node, of course, chooses the node with the lowest id as its successor.",
                "We now discuss the data storage schemes for groups.",
                "Memory is a scarce resource in sensor nodes and it is therefore important that witness information be stored efficiently among group members.",
                "Efficient data storage is not a trivial task when it comes to groups.",
                "The tradeoff is between simplicity of the scheme and memory savings.",
                "A simpler scheme incurs lesser energy cost as compared to a more sophisticated scheme, but offers lesser memory savings as well.",
                "This is because in a more complicated scheme, the group members have to coordinate to update and store information.",
                "After considering a number of different schemes, we have come to a conclusion that there is no optimal storage scheme for groups.",
                "The system should be able to adapt according to its requirements.",
                "If group members are low on battery, then the group can adapt a scheme that is more energy efficient.",
                "Similarly, if the group members are running out of memory, they can adapt a scheme that is more memory efficient.",
                "We first present a simple scheme that is very energy efficient but does not offer significant memory savings.",
                "We then present an alternate scheme that is much more memory efficient.",
                "As already mentioned a group can receive information only through the group leader.",
                "Whenever the leader comes across an external node e, it receives information from that node and saves it.",
                "In our first scheme, when the timeslot for the leader expires, the leader passes this new information it received from e to its successor.",
                "This is important because during the next time slot, if the new leader comes across another external node, it should be able to pass information about all the external nodes this group has witnessed so far.",
                "Thus the information is fully replicated on all nodes to maintain the correct view of the world.",
                "Our first scheme does not offer any memory savings but is highly energy efficient and may be a good choice when the group members are running low on battery.",
                "Except for the time when the leadership is switched, all n − 1 members are asleep at any given time.",
                "This means that a single member is up for t seconds once every n∗t seconds and therefore has to spend approximately only 1/nth of its energy.",
                "Thus, if there are 5 members in a group, we save 80% energy, which is huge.",
                "More energy can be saved by increasing the group size.",
                "We now present an alternate data storage scheme that aims at saving memory at the cost of energy.",
                "In this scheme we divide the group into what we call partitions.",
                "Partitions can be thought of as subgroups within a group.",
                "Each partition must have at least two nodes in it.",
                "The nodes within a partition are called peers.",
                "Each partition has one peer designated as partition leader.",
                "The partition leader stays in receive mode at all times, while all others peers a partition stay in the sleep mode.",
                "Partition leadership is time-multiplexed among the peers to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery.",
                "Like before, a group has exactly one leader and the leadership is time-multiplexed among partitions.",
                "The group leader also serves as the partition leader for the partition it belongs to (See Figure 11).",
                "In this scheme, all partition leaders participate in information exchange.",
                "Whenever a group comes across an external node e, every partition leader receives all witness information, but it only stores a subset of that information after filtering.",
                "Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send witness information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to.",
                "However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode.",
                "Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their witness information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide.",
                "All this is achieved by having the group leader send a signal to every partition leader in turn. 186 Figure 11: The figure shows a group of eight nodes divided into four partitions of 2 nodes each.",
                "Node 1 is the group leader whereas nodes 2, 9, and 7 are partition leaders.",
                "All other nodes are in the sleep mode.",
                "Since the partition leadership is time-multiplexed, it is important that any information received by the partition leader, p1, be passed on to the next leader, p2.",
                "This has to be done to make sure that p2 has all the information that it might need to send when it comes across another external node during its timeslot.",
                "One way of achieving this is to wake p2 up just before p1s timeslot expires and then have p1 transfer information only to p2.",
                "An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers.",
                "Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep.",
                "In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information.",
                "In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes.",
                "In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers.",
                "Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one.",
                "A group can be divided into partitions in more than one way.",
                "For example, suppose we have a group of six members.",
                "We can divide this group into three partitions of two peers each, or two partitions with three peers each.",
                "The choice once again depends on the requirements of the system.",
                "A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient.",
                "This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time.",
                "On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12).",
                "A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery.",
                "This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node.",
                "For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node.",
                "Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all witness information stored in that partition will be lost.",
                "We have devised a very simple protocol to solve this problem.",
                "We first explain how partiFigure 12: The figure shows two different ways of partitioning a group of six nodes.",

                "Suppose node 2 in figure 3 (a) dies.",
                "When node 5, the partition leader, sends information to node 2, it does not receive an acknowledgement from it and concludes that node 2 has died2 .",
                "At this point, node 5 contacts other partition leaders (nodes 1 ... 9) using a broadcast message and informs them that one of its peers has died.",
                "Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of witness information stored in its partition.",
                "Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders.",
                "Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition.",
                "However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition.",
                "It chooses the partition that has the least amount of witness information to join.",
                "It sends its witness information to the new partition leader.",
                "Witness information and membership update is propagated to all peers during the next partition leadership change.",
                "We now consider the case where the partition leader dies.",
                "If this happens, then we wait for the partition leadership to change and for the new partition leader to eventually find out that a peer has died.",
                "Once the new partition leader finds out that it needs more peers, it proceeds with the protocol explained above.",
                "However, in this case, we do lose information that the previous partition leader might have received just before it died.",
                "This problem can be solved by implementing a more rigorous protocol, but we have decided to give up on accuracy to save energy.",
                "Our current design uses time-division multiplexing to schedule wakeup and sleep modes in the sensor nodes.",

                "SYSTEM EVALUATION A sensor is constrained in the amount of memory and power.",
                "In general, the amount of memory needed and power consumption depends on a variety of factors such as node density, number of hiker encounters, and the number of access points.",
                "In this Section, we provide an estimate of how long the power of a MICA2 mote will last under certain assumtions.",

                "Since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take 0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34 seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link.",
                "The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh.",
                "Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per hour.",
                "So, average power consumtion due to transmission and reception is (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 mA per hour.",

                "An encounter between two hikers results in exchange of about 50 witness records that takes about 0.68 seconds as calculated above.",

                "Assuming that a node emits a beacon every 90 seconds and a hiker encounter occurs everytime a beacon is emitted (worst-case scenario), a single alkaline battery will last for (841764 ∗ 90)/(30 ∗ 24 ∗ 60 ∗ 60) = 29 days.",
                "Since, a Mica2 is equipped with two batteries, a Mica2 sensor can remain operation for about two months.",

                "To determine the hot search areas, the witness records of hiker 6 are processed to determine the trail he is most likely on, the speed at which he had been moving, direction in which he had been moving, and his last known location.",

                "Again, by applying the record gap criteria, two of these three records will be erased.",
                "Our experiments did not generate enough data to test the impact of record count or hop count criteria.",
                "To evaluate the impact of these criteria, we simulated CenWits to generate a significantly large number of records for a given number of hikers and access points.",
                "We generated witness records by having the hikers walk randomly.",

                "In our future work, we plan to undertake a major study to address these two concerns. 7.",
                "OTHER APPLICATIONS In addition to the hiking in wilderness areas, CenWits can be used in several other applications, e.g. skiing, climbing, wild life monitoring, and person tracking.",
                "Since CenWits relies only on intermittent connectivity, it can take advantage of the existing cheap and mature technologies, and thereby make tracking cheaper and fairly accurate.",
                "Since CenWits doesnt rely on keeping track of a sensor holder all time, but relies on maintaining witnesses, the system is relatively cheaper and widely applicable.",
                "For example, there are some dangerous cliffs in most ski resorts.",
                "But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain.",
                "Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries.",
                "These boundary sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff.",
                "Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs.",
                "If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier.",
                "If there is no witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.",
                "In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals.",
                "To collect data, either a satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver.",
                "GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2].",
                "Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds.",
                "Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it.",
                "Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of deers.",
                "CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces.",
                "CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case.",
                "Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data.",
                "In fact, the access points need not be statically located.",
                "They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.",
                "In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesnt work indoor and near skyscrapers.",
                "If a person A is reported missing, and from the witness records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 8.",
                "DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new search and rescue system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current search and rescue systems.",
                "These advantages include a looselycoupled system that relies only on intermittent network connectivity, power and storage efficiency, and low cost.",
                "It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
                "It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies.",
                "A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.",
                "In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.",
                "An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.",
                "This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.",
                "We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.",
                "While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system.",
                "We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present.",
                "Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.",
                "There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.",
                "For example, an adversary can sniff the witness information to locate endangered animals, females, children, etc.",
                "He may inject false information in the system.",
                "An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.",
                "In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.",
                "So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.",
                "However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.",
                "Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.",
                "In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.",
                "Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.",
                "So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.",
                "Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment.",
                "In particular, discussions are currenly underway to deploy CenWits in the Rocky Mountain and Yosemite National Parks. 9.",

                "CenWits uses several small, commonly-available RF-based sensors, and a small number of storage and processing devices.",
                "It is designed for search and rescue of people in emergency situations in wilderness areas.",
                "A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation.",
                "It is designed for an intermittently connected network that provides only occasional connectivity.",
                "It makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",

                "INTRODUCTION Search and rescue of people in emergency situation in a timely manner is an extremely important service.",
                "It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation.",
                "With the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc.",
                "All these systems require a connected network via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices.",
                "This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.",
                "For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.",
                "As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.",
                "While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.",
                "Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car.",
                "An RF transmitter has a relatively smaller range of transmission.",
                "So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area.",
                "In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.",
                "In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.",
                "In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).",
                "CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors.",
                "A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location.",
                "The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world.",
                "This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.",
                "In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.",
                "In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network.",
                "Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network.",
                "As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.",
                "Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective.",
                "A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.",
                "The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions.",
                "Groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.",
                "Using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information.",
                "In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.",
                "Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.",
                "It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.",
                "This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors.",
                "The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.",
                "However, these techniques are quite general.",
                "We discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques.",
                "While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.",
                "First, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not require a connected network.",
                "Second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization.",
                "Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we overview some of the recent projects and technologies related to movement and location tracking, and search and rescue systems.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the overall architecture of CenWits, and provide a high-level description of its functionality.",
                "In the next section, Section 4, we discuss power and memory management in CenWits.",
                "To simplify our presentation, we will focus on a specific application of tracking lost/injured hikers in all these sections.",
                "In Section 6, we describe a prototype implementation of CenWits and present performance measured from this implementation.",

                "It then runs into A on the trail who doesnt have GPS reception either.",
                "Their sensors record the presence of each other.",
                "After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A.",
                "When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter location of A and B.",
                "By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be inferred.",
                "Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).",
                "Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.",
                "CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.",
                "Such a synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available.",
                "In addition, sensor nodes in CenWits synchronize their clocks whenever they are in the range of an AP or an LP.",
                "The Figure 8: Based on overlapping landscape, B might have hiked to wrong branch and fallen off a cliff.",
                "Hot rescue areas can thus be determined synchronization accuracy Cenwits needs is of the order of a second or so.",
                "As long as the clocks are synchronized with in one second range, whether A met B at 12:3745 or 12:3746 doesnt matter in the ordering of witness events and inferring the path. 4.",
                "MEMORY AND POWER MANAGEMENT CenWits employs several important mechanisms to conserve power and memory.",
                "It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory.",
                "With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of witness information stored at a node can get very large.",
                "This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of witness information over time.",
                "To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically.",
                "This raises an interesting question of when and which witness record should be deleted from the memory of a node?",
                "CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap.",
                "Record count refers to the number of witness records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT.",
                "It stores at most MAX RECORD COUNT witness records of any node.",
                "Every witness record has a hop count field that stores the number times (hops) this record has been transferred since being created.",
                "Initially this field is set to 0.",
                "Whenever a node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.",
                "We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet.",
                "The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up.",
                "For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes.",
                "On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node.",
                "Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two witness records with the same node id.",
                "To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two witness records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "For each node id i, n stores the witness record with the most recent record time rti, the witness with most recent record time that is at least MIN RECORD GAP time units before rti, and so on until the record count limit (MAX RECORD COUNT) is reached.",
                "When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory.",
                "It decrements MAX RECORD COUNT and MAX HOP COUNT, and increments MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "It then first erases all witness records whose hop count exceeds the reduced MAX HOP COUNT value, and then erases witness records to satisfy the record gap criteria.",
                "Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its witness information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions.",
                "For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a beacon every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour.",
                "However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a beacon should be emitted every 10 seconds.",
                "If a user is not moving at all, a beacon can be emitted every 10 minutes.",
                "In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time.",
                "If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy.",
                "In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals.",
                "For example, suppose <br>hiker</br> A has communicated its witness information to three other hikers in the last five minutes.",
                "If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional witness information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to sleep mode if it is extremely low on power.",
                "The bandwidth and energy limitations of sensor nodes require that the amount of data transferred among the nodes be reduced to minimum.",
                "It has been observed that in some scenarios 3000 instructions could be executed for the same energy cost of sending a bit 100m by radio [15].",
                "To reduce the amount of data transfer, CenWits employs a handshake protocol that two nodes execute when they encounter one another.",
                "The goal of this protocol is to ensure that a node transmits only as much witness information as the other node is willing to receive.",
                "This protocol is initiated when a node i receives a beacon containing the node ID of the sender node j and i has not exchanged witness information with j in the last δ time units.",

                "At any point in time, a group has exactly one leader that communicates 185 with external nodes on behalf of the entire group.",
                "A group can be static, meaning that the group membership does not change over the period of time, or it could be dynamic in which case nodes can leave or join the group.",
                "To make our analysis simple and to explain the advantages of group, we first discuss static groups.",
                "A static group is formed at the start of a hiking trail or ski slope.",
                "Suppose there are five family members who want to go for a hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park.",
                "Before these members start their hike, each one of them is given a sensor node and the information is entered in the system that the five nodes form a group.",
                "Each group member is given a unique id and every group member knows about other members of the group.",
                "The group, as a whole, is also assigned an id to distinguish it from other groups in the system.",
                "Figure 10: A group of five people.",
                "Node 2 is the group leader and it is communicating on behalf of the group with an external node 17.",
                "All other (shown in a lighter shade) are in sleep mode.",
                "As the group moves through the trail, it exchanges information with other nodes or groups that it comes across.",
                "At any point in time, only one group member, called the leader, sends and receives information on behalf of the group and all other n − 1 group members are put in the sleep mode (See Figure 10).",
                "It is this property of groups that saves us energy.",
                "The group leadership is time-multiplexed among the group members.",
                "This is done to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery due to continuous exchange of information.",
                "Thus after every t seconds, the leadership is passed on to another node, called the successor, and the leader (now an ordinary member) is put to sleep.",
                "Since energy is dear, we do not implement an extensive election algorithm for choosing the successor.",
                "Instead, we choose the successor on the basis of node id.",

                "A simpler scheme incurs lesser energy cost as compared to a more sophisticated scheme, but offers lesser memory savings as well.",
                "This is because in a more complicated scheme, the group members have to coordinate to update and store information.",
                "After considering a number of different schemes, we have come to a conclusion that there is no optimal storage scheme for groups.",
                "The system should be able to adapt according to its requirements.",
                "If group members are low on battery, then the group can adapt a scheme that is more energy efficient.",
                "Similarly, if the group members are running out of memory, they can adapt a scheme that is more memory efficient.",
                "We first present a simple scheme that is very energy efficient but does not offer significant memory savings.",
                "We then present an alternate scheme that is much more memory efficient.",

                "Whenever the leader comes across an external node e, it receives information from that node and saves it.",
                "In our first scheme, when the timeslot for the leader expires, the leader passes this new information it received from e to its successor.",
                "This is important because during the next time slot, if the new leader comes across another external node, it should be able to pass information about all the external nodes this group has witnessed so far.",
                "Thus the information is fully replicated on all nodes to maintain the correct view of the world.",
                "Our first scheme does not offer any memory savings but is highly energy efficient and may be a good choice when the group members are running low on battery.",
                "Except for the time when the leadership is switched, all n − 1 members are asleep at any given time.",
                "This means that a single member is up for t seconds once every n∗t seconds and therefore has to spend approximately only 1/nth of its energy.",
                "Thus, if there are 5 members in a group, we save 80% energy, which is huge.",
                "More energy can be saved by increasing the group size.",
                "We now present an alternate data storage scheme that aims at saving memory at the cost of energy.",
                "In this scheme we divide the group into what we call partitions.",
                "Partitions can be thought of as subgroups within a group.",
                "Each partition must have at least two nodes in it.",
                "The nodes within a partition are called peers.",
                "Each partition has one peer designated as partition leader.",
                "The partition leader stays in receive mode at all times, while all others peers a partition stay in the sleep mode.",
                "Partition leadership is time-multiplexed among the peers to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery.",
                "Like before, a group has exactly one leader and the leadership is time-multiplexed among partitions.",
                "The group leader also serves as the partition leader for the partition it belongs to (See Figure 11).",
                "In this scheme, all partition leaders participate in information exchange.",
                "Whenever a group comes across an external node e, every partition leader receives all witness information, but it only stores a subset of that information after filtering.",
                "Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send witness information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to.",
                "However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode.",
                "Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their witness information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide.",
                "All this is achieved by having the group leader send a signal to every partition leader in turn. 186 Figure 11: The figure shows a group of eight nodes divided into four partitions of 2 nodes each.",
                "Node 1 is the group leader whereas nodes 2, 9, and 7 are partition leaders.",
                "All other nodes are in the sleep mode.",
                "Since the partition leadership is time-multiplexed, it is important that any information received by the partition leader, p1, be passed on to the next leader, p2.",
                "This has to be done to make sure that p2 has all the information that it might need to send when it comes across another external node during its timeslot.",
                "One way of achieving this is to wake p2 up just before p1s timeslot expires and then have p1 transfer information only to p2.",
                "An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers.",
                "Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep.",
                "In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information.",
                "In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes.",
                "In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers.",
                "Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one.",
                "A group can be divided into partitions in more than one way.",
                "For example, suppose we have a group of six members.",
                "We can divide this group into three partitions of two peers each, or two partitions with three peers each.",
                "The choice once again depends on the requirements of the system.",
                "A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient.",
                "This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time.",
                "On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12).",
                "A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery.",
                "This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node.",
                "For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node.",
                "Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all witness information stored in that partition will be lost.",
                "We have devised a very simple protocol to solve this problem.",

                "Suppose node 2 in figure 3 (a) dies.",
                "When node 5, the partition leader, sends information to node 2, it does not receive an acknowledgement from it and concludes that node 2 has died2 .",
                "At this point, node 5 contacts other partition leaders (nodes 1 ... 9) using a broadcast message and informs them that one of its peers has died.",
                "Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of witness information stored in its partition.",
                "Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders.",
                "Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition.",
                "However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition.",
                "It chooses the partition that has the least amount of witness information to join.",
                "It sends its witness information to the new partition leader.",
                "Witness information and membership update is propagated to all peers during the next partition leadership change.",
                "We now consider the case where the partition leader dies.",
                "If this happens, then we wait for the partition leadership to change and for the new partition leader to eventually find out that a peer has died.",
                "Once the new partition leader finds out that it needs more peers, it proceeds with the protocol explained above.",
                "However, in this case, we do lose information that the previous partition leader might have received just before it died.",
                "This problem can be solved by implementing a more rigorous protocol, but we have decided to give up on accuracy to save energy.",
                "Our current design uses time-division multiplexing to schedule wakeup and sleep modes in the sensor nodes.",

                "Since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take 0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34 seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link.",
                "The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh.",
                "Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per hour.",
                "So, average power consumtion due to transmission and reception is (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 mA per hour.",

                "For example, the witness records generated by 3 at record times 76, 78 and 79 (see Table 3) have all been generated due a single contact between access point C and node 3.",
                "By applying the record gap criteria, two of these three records will be erased.",
                "Similarly, the witness records generated by 1 at record times 10, 15 and 16 (see Table 1) have all been generated due a single contact between access point A and node 1.",
                "Again, by applying the record gap criteria, two of these three records will be erased.",
                "Our experiments did not generate enough data to test the impact of record count or hop count criteria.",
                "To evaluate the impact of these criteria, we simulated CenWits to generate a significantly large number of records for a given number of hikers and access points.",
                "We generated witness records by having the hikers walk randomly.",
                "We applied the three criteria to measure the amount of memory savings in a sensor node.",
                "The results are shown in Table 4.",

                "The number of witness records reported in this table is an average number of witness records a sensor node stored at the time of dump to an access point.",
                "These results show that the three memory management criteria significantly reduces the memory consumption of sensor nodes in CenWits.",

                "However, these results are premature at present for two reasons: (1) They are generated via simulation of hikers walking at random; and (2) It is not clear what impact the erasing of witness records has on the accuracy of inferred location/hot search areas of lost hikers.",
                "In our future work, we plan to undertake a major study to address these two concerns. 7.",
                "OTHER APPLICATIONS In addition to the hiking in wilderness areas, CenWits can be used in several other applications, e.g. skiing, climbing, wild life monitoring, and person tracking.",
                "Since CenWits relies only on intermittent connectivity, it can take advantage of the existing cheap and mature technologies, and thereby make tracking cheaper and fairly accurate.",
                "Since CenWits doesnt rely on keeping track of a sensor holder all time, but relies on maintaining witnesses, the system is relatively cheaper and widely applicable.",
                "For example, there are some dangerous cliffs in most ski resorts.",
                "But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain.",
                "Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries.",
                "These boundary sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff.",
                "Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs.",
                "If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier.",
                "If there is no witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.",
                "In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals.",
                "To collect data, either a satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver.",
                "GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2].",
                "Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds.",
                "Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it.",
                "Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of deers.",
                "CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces.",
                "CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case.",
                "Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data.",
                "In fact, the access points need not be statically located.",
                "They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.",
                "In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesnt work indoor and near skyscrapers.",
                "If a person A is reported missing, and from the witness records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 8.",
                "DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new search and rescue system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current search and rescue systems.",
                "These advantages include a looselycoupled system that relies only on intermittent network connectivity, power and storage efficiency, and low cost.",
                "It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
                "It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies.",
                "A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.",
                "In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a <br>hiker</br> is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.",
                "An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.",
                "This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.",
                "We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.",
                "While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system.",
                "We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present.",
                "Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.",
                "There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.",
                "For example, an adversary can sniff the witness information to locate endangered animals, females, children, etc.",
                "He may inject false information in the system.",
                "An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.",
                "In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.",
                "So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.",
                "However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.",
                "Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.",
                "In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.",
                "Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.",
                "So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.",
                "Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment.",
                "In particular, discussions are currenly underway to deploy CenWits in the Rocky Mountain and Yosemite National Parks. 9.",

                "It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation.",
                "With the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc.",
                "All these systems require a connected network via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices.",
                "This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.",
                "For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.",
                "As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.",
                "While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.",
                "Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car.",
                "An RF transmitter has a relatively smaller range of transmission.",
                "So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area.",
                "In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.",
                "In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.",
                "In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).",
                "CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors.",
                "A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location.",
                "The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world.",
                "This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.",
                "In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.",
                "In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network.",
                "Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network.",
                "As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.",
                "Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective.",
                "A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.",
                "The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions.",
                "Groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.",
                "Using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information.",
                "In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.",
                "Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.",
                "It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.",
                "This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors.",
                "The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.",
                "However, these techniques are quite general.",
                "We discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques.",
                "While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.",
                "First, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not require a connected network.",
                "Second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization.",
                "Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we overview some of the recent projects and technologies related to movement and location tracking, and search and rescue systems.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the overall architecture of CenWits, and provide a high-level description of its functionality.",
                "In the next section, Section 4, we discuss power and memory management in CenWits.",
                "To simplify our presentation, we will focus on a specific application of tracking lost/injured hikers in all these sections.",
                "In Section 6, we describe a prototype implementation of CenWits and present performance measured from this implementation.",
                "We discuss how the ideas of CenWits can be used to build several other applications in Section 7.",
                "Finally, in Section 8, we discuss some related issues and conclude the paper. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK A survey of location systems for ubiquitous computing is provided in [11].",

                "If contact cannot be made, emergency services are dispatched to the location provided by GPS.",
                "Like PLBs, this system has several limitations.",
                "First, it is heavy and expensive.",
                "It requires a satellite transmitter and a connected network.",
                "If connectivity with either the GPS network or a communication satellite cannot be maintained, the system fails.",
                "Unfortunately, these are common obstacles encountered in deep canyons, narrow streets in large cities, parking garages, and a number of other places. 181 The Lifetch system uses GPS receiver board combined with a GSM/GPRS transmitter and an RF transmitter in one wireless sensor node called Intelligent Communication Unit (ICU).",
                "An ICU first attempts to transmit its location to a control center through GSM/GPRS network.",
                "If that fails, it connects with other ICUs (adhoc network) to forward its location information until the information reaches an ICU that has GSM/GPRS reception.",
                "This ICU then transmits the location information of the original ICU via the GSM/GPRS network.",
                "ZebraNet is a system designed to study the moving patterns of zebras [13].",
                "It utilizes two protocols: History-based protocol and flooding protocol.",
                "History-based protocol is used when the zebras are grazing and not moving around too much.",
                "While this might be useful for tracking zebras, its not suitable for tracking hikers because two hikers are most likely to meet each other only once on a trail.",
                "In the flooding protocol, a node dumps its data to a neighbor whenever it finds one and doesnt delete its own copy until it finds a base station.",
                "Without considering routing loops, packet filtering and grouping, the size of data on a node will grow exponentially and drain the power and memory of a sensor node with in a short time.",
                "Instead, Cenwits uses a four-phase hand-shake protocol to ensure that a node transmits only as much information as the other node is willing to receive.",
                "While ZebraNet is designed for a big group of sensors moving together in the same direction with same speed, Cenwits is designed to be used in the scenario where sensors move in different directions at different speeds.",
                "Delay tolerant network architecture addresses some important problems in challenged (resource-constrained) networks [9].",
                "While this work is mainly concerned with interoperability of challenged networks, some problems related to occasionally-connected networks are similar to the ones we have addressed in CenWits.",
                "Among all these systems, luxury PLB and Lifetch are designed for location tracking in wilderness areas.",
                "However, both of these systems require a connected network.",
                "Luxury PLB requires the user to transmit a signal to a satellite, while Lifetch requires connection to GSM/GPRS network.",
                "Luxury PLB transmits location information, only when an accident happens.",
                "However, if the user is buried in the snow or falls into a deep canyon, there is almost no chance for the signal to go through and be relayed to the rescue team.",
                "This is because satellite transmission needs line of sight.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no known history of users location, it is not possible for the rescue team to infer the current location of the user.",
                "Another disadvantage of luxury PLB is that a satellite transmitter is very expensive, costing in the range of $750.",
                "Lifetch attempts to transmit the location information by GSM/GPRS and adhoc sensor network that uses AODV as the routing protocol.",
                "However, having a cellular reception in remote areas in wilderness areas, e.g.",
                "American national parks is unlikely.",
                "Furthermore, it is extremely unlikely that ICUs worn by hikers will be able to form an adhoc network in a large wilderness area.",
                "This is because the hikers are mobile and it is very unlikely to have several ICUs placed dense enough to forward packets even on a very popular hike route.",

                "It is not reliant upon constant connectivity with any communication medium.",
                "Rather, it communicates information along from user to user, finally arriving at a control center.",
                "Unlike several of the systems discussed so far, it does not require that a users unit is constantly turned on.",
                "In fact, it can discover a victims location, even if the victims sensor was off at the time of accident and has remained off since then.",
                "CenWits solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",

                "Each hiker wears a sensor (MICA2 motes in our prototype) equipped with a GPS receiver and an RF transmitter.",
                "Each sensor is assigned a unique ID and maintains its current location based on the signal received by its GPS receiver.",
                "It also emits beacons periodically.",

                "The key idea here is that if two sensors come with in range of each other at any time, they become each others witnesses.",
                "Later on, if the hiker wearing one of these sensors is lost, the other sensor can convey the last known (witnessed) location of the lost hiker.",
                "Furthermore, by exchanging the witness information that each sensor recorded earlier, the witness information is propagated beyond a direct contact between two sensors.",
                "To convey witness information to a processing center or to a rescue team, access points are established at well-known locations that the hikers are expected to pass through, e.g. at the trail heads, trail ends, intersection of different trails, scenic view points, resting areas, and so on.",
                "Whenever a sensor node is in the vicinity of an access point, all witness information stored in that sensor is automatically dumped to the access point.",
                "Access points are connected to a processing center via satellite or some other network1 .",
                "The witness information is downloaded to the processing center from various access points at regular intervals.",
                "In case, connection to an access point is lost, the information from that 1 A connection is needed only between access points and a processing center.",
                "There is no need for any connection between different access points. 182 access point can be downloaded manually, e.g. by UAVs.",
                "To estimate the speed, location and direction of a hiker at any point in time, all witness information of that hiker that has been collected from various access points is processed.",
                "Figure 2: Hiker A and Hiker B are in the range of each other.",
                "A records the presence of B and B records the presence of A.",

                "It uploads its recorded witness information and clears its memory.",
                "An example of how CenWits operates is illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3.",
                "First, hikers A and B are on two close trails, but out of range of each other (Figure 1).",
                "This is a very common scenario during a hike.",
                "For example, on a popular four-hour hike, a hiker might run into as many as 20 other hikers.",
                "This accounts for one encounter every 12 minutes on average.",
                "A slow hiker can go 1 mile (5,280 feet) per hour.",
                "Thus in 12 minutes a slow hiker can go as far as 1056 feet.",
                "This implies that if we were to put 20 hikers on a 4-hour, one-way hike evenly, the range of each sensor node should be at least 1056 feet for them to communicate with one another continuously.",
                "The signal strength starts dropping rapidly for two Mica2 nodes to communicate with each other when they are 180 feet away, and is completely lost when they are 230 feet away from each other[7].",
                "So, for the sensors to form a sensor network on a 4-hour hiking trail, there should be at least 120 hikers scattered evenly.",
                "Clearly, this is extremely unlikely.",
                "In fact, in a 4-hour, less-popular hiking trail, one might only run into say five other hikers.",
                "CenWits takes advantage of the fact that sensors can communicate with one another and record their presence.",
                "Given a walking speed of one mile per hour (88 feet per minute) and Mica2 range of about 150 feet for non-line-of-sight radio transmission, two hikers have about 150/88 = 1.7 minutes to discover the presence of each other and exchange their witness information.",
                "We therefore design our system to have each sensor emit a beacon every one-and-a-half minute.",
                "In Figure 2, hiker Bs sensor emits a beacon when A is in range, this triggers A to exchange data with B.",
                "A communicates the following information to B: My ID is A; I saw C at 1:23 PM at (39◦ 49.3277655, 105◦ 39.1126776), I saw E at 3:09 PM at (40◦ 49.2234879, 105◦ 20.3290168).",

                "Each node is assigned a unique Node Id when it enters a trail.",
                "In our current prototype, we have allocated one byte for Node Id, although this can be increased to two or more bytes if a large number of hikers are expected to be present at the same time.",
                "We can represent time in 17 bits to a second precision.",
                "So, we have allocated 3 bytes each for Record Time and Location Time.",
                "The circumference of the Earth is approximately 40,075 KM.",
                "If we use a 32-bit number to represent both longitude and latitude, the precision we get is 40,075,000/232 = 0.0093 meter = 0.37 inches, which is quite precise for our needs.",

                "When there is a heavy cloud cover, GPS users have experienced inaccuracy in the reported location as well.",

                "To address this, CenWits incorporates the idea of location points (LP).",
                "A location point can update a sensor node with its current location whenever the node is near that LP.",
                "LPs are placed at different locations in a wilderness area where GPS receivers dont work.",
                "An LP is a very simple device that emits prerecorded location information at some regular time interval.",
                "It can be placed in difficult-to-reach places such as deep canyons and dense rain forests by simply dropping them from an airplane.",
                "LPs allow a sensor node to determine its current location more accurately.",
                "However, they are not 183 an essential requirement of CenWits.",
                "If an LP runs out of power, the CenWits will continue to work correctly.",
                "Figure 5: GPS receiver not working correctly.",
                "Sensors then have to rely on LP to provide coordination In Figure 5, B cannot get GPS reception due to bad weather.",
                "It then runs into A on the trail who doesnt have GPS reception either.",
                "Their sensors record the presence of each other.",
                "After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A.",
                "When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter location of A and B.",
                "By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be inferred.",
                "Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).",
                "Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.",
                "CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.",
                "Such a synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available.",
                "In addition, sensor nodes in CenWits synchronize their clocks whenever they are in the range of an AP or an LP.",
                "The Figure 8: Based on overlapping landscape, B might have hiked to wrong branch and fallen off a cliff.",
                "Hot rescue areas can thus be determined synchronization accuracy Cenwits needs is of the order of a second or so.",
                "As long as the clocks are synchronized with in one second range, whether A met B at 12:3745 or 12:3746 doesnt matter in the ordering of witness events and inferring the path. 4.",
                "MEMORY AND POWER MANAGEMENT CenWits employs several important mechanisms to conserve power and memory.",
                "It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory.",
                "With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of witness information stored at a node can get very large.",
                "This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of witness information over time.",
                "To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically.",
                "This raises an interesting question of when and which witness record should be deleted from the memory of a node?",
                "CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap.",
                "Record count refers to the number of witness records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT.",
                "It stores at most MAX RECORD COUNT witness records of any node.",
                "Every witness record has a hop count field that stores the number times (hops) this record has been transferred since being created.",
                "Initially this field is set to 0.",
                "Whenever a node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.",
                "We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet.",
                "The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up.",
                "For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes.",
                "On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node.",
                "Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two witness records with the same node id.",
                "To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two witness records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "For each node id i, n stores the witness record with the most recent record time rti, the witness with most recent record time that is at least MIN RECORD GAP time units before rti, and so on until the record count limit (MAX RECORD COUNT) is reached.",
                "When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory.",
                "It decrements MAX RECORD COUNT and MAX HOP COUNT, and increments MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "It then first erases all witness records whose hop count exceeds the reduced MAX HOP COUNT value, and then erases witness records to satisfy the record gap criteria.",
                "Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its witness information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions.",
                "For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a beacon every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour.",
                "However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a beacon should be emitted every 10 seconds.",
                "If a user is not moving at all, a beacon can be emitted every 10 minutes.",
                "In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time.",
                "If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy.",
                "In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals.",
                "For example, suppose hiker A has communicated its witness information to three other hikers in the last five minutes.",
                "If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional witness information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to sleep mode if it is extremely low on power.",
                "The bandwidth and energy limitations of sensor nodes require that the amount of data transferred among the nodes be reduced to minimum.",
                "It has been observed that in some scenarios 3000 instructions could be executed for the same energy cost of sending a bit 100m by radio [15].",
                "To reduce the amount of data transfer, CenWits employs a handshake protocol that two nodes execute when they encounter one another.",
                "The goal of this protocol is to ensure that a node transmits only as much witness information as the other node is willing to receive.",
                "This protocol is initiated when a node i receives a beacon containing the node ID of the sender node j and i has not exchanged witness information with j in the last δ time units.",
                "Assume that i < j.",
                "The protocol consists of four phases (See Figure 9): 1.",
                "Phase I: Node i sends its receive constraints and the number of witness records it has in its memory. 2.",
                "Phase II: On receiving this message from i, j sends its receive constraints and the number of witness records it has in its memory. 3.",
                "Phase III: On receiving the above message from j, i sends its witness information (filtered based on receive constraints received in phase II). 4.",
                "Phase IV: After receiving the witness records from i, j sends its witness information (filtered based on receive constraints received in phase I). j <Constaints, Witness info size> <Constaints, Witness info size> <Filtered Witness info> <Filtered Witness info> i j j j i i i Figure 9: Four-Phase Hand Shake Protocol (i < j) Receive constraints are a function of memory and power.",
                "In the most general case, they are comprised of the three parameters (record count, hop count and record gap) used for memory management.",
                "If i is low on memory, it specifies the maximum number of records it is willing to accept from j.",
                "Similarly, i can ask j to send only those records that have hop count value less than MAX HOP COUNT − 1.",
                "Finally, i can include its MIN RECORD GAP value in its receive constraints.",
                "Note that the handshake protocol is beneficial to both i and j.",
                "They save memory by receiving only as much information as they are willing to accept and conserve energy by sending only as many witness records as needed.",
                "It turns out that filtering witness records based on MIN RECORD GAP is complex.",
                "It requires that the witness records of any given node be arranged in an order sorted by their record time values.",
                "Maintaining this sorted order is complex in memory, because new witness records with the same node id can arrive later that may have to be inserted in between to preserve the sorted order.",
                "For this reason, the receive constraints in the current CenWits prototype do not include record gap.",
                "Suppose i specifies a hop count value of 3.",
                "In this case, j checks the hop count field of every witness record before sending them.",
                "If the hop count value is greater than 3, the record is not transmitted. 4.3 Groups and Partitions To further reduce communication and increase the lifetime of our system, we introduce the notion of groups.",
                "The idea is based on the concept of abstract regions presented in [20].",
                "A group is a set of n nodes that can be defined in terms of radio connectivity, geographic location, or other properties of nodes.",
                "All nodes within a group can communicate directly with one another and they share information to maintain their view of the external world.",
                "At any point in time, a group has exactly one leader that communicates 185 with external nodes on behalf of the entire group.",
                "A group can be static, meaning that the group membership does not change over the period of time, or it could be dynamic in which case nodes can leave or join the group.",
                "To make our analysis simple and to explain the advantages of group, we first discuss static groups.",
                "A static group is formed at the start of a hiking trail or ski slope.",
                "Suppose there are five family members who want to go for a hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park.",
                "Before these members start their hike, each one of them is given a sensor node and the information is entered in the system that the five nodes form a group.",
                "Each group member is given a unique id and every group member knows about other members of the group.",
                "The group, as a whole, is also assigned an id to distinguish it from other groups in the system.",
                "Figure 10: A group of five people.",
                "Node 2 is the group leader and it is communicating on behalf of the group with an external node 17.",
                "All other (shown in a lighter shade) are in sleep mode.",
                "As the group moves through the trail, it exchanges information with other nodes or groups that it comes across.",
                "At any point in time, only one group member, called the leader, sends and receives information on behalf of the group and all other n − 1 group members are put in the sleep mode (See Figure 10).",
                "It is this property of groups that saves us energy.",
                "The group leadership is time-multiplexed among the group members.",
                "This is done to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery due to continuous exchange of information.",
                "Thus after every t seconds, the leadership is passed on to another node, called the successor, and the leader (now an ordinary member) is put to sleep.",
                "Since energy is dear, we do not implement an extensive election algorithm for choosing the successor.",
                "Instead, we choose the successor on the basis of node id.",
                "The node with the next highest id in the group is chosen as the successor.",
                "The last node, of course, chooses the node with the lowest id as its successor.",
                "We now discuss the data storage schemes for groups.",
                "Memory is a scarce resource in sensor nodes and it is therefore important that witness information be stored efficiently among group members.",
                "Efficient data storage is not a trivial task when it comes to groups.",
                "The tradeoff is between simplicity of the scheme and memory savings.",
                "A simpler scheme incurs lesser energy cost as compared to a more sophisticated scheme, but offers lesser memory savings as well.",
                "This is because in a more complicated scheme, the group members have to coordinate to update and store information.",
                "After considering a number of different schemes, we have come to a conclusion that there is no optimal storage scheme for groups.",
                "The system should be able to adapt according to its requirements.",
                "If group members are low on battery, then the group can adapt a scheme that is more energy efficient.",
                "Similarly, if the group members are running out of memory, they can adapt a scheme that is more memory efficient.",
                "We first present a simple scheme that is very energy efficient but does not offer significant memory savings.",
                "We then present an alternate scheme that is much more memory efficient.",
                "As already mentioned a group can receive information only through the group leader.",
                "Whenever the leader comes across an external node e, it receives information from that node and saves it.",
                "In our first scheme, when the timeslot for the leader expires, the leader passes this new information it received from e to its successor.",
                "This is important because during the next time slot, if the new leader comes across another external node, it should be able to pass information about all the external nodes this group has witnessed so far.",
                "Thus the information is fully replicated on all nodes to maintain the correct view of the world.",
                "Our first scheme does not offer any memory savings but is highly energy efficient and may be a good choice when the group members are running low on battery.",
                "Except for the time when the leadership is switched, all n − 1 members are asleep at any given time.",
                "This means that a single member is up for t seconds once every n∗t seconds and therefore has to spend approximately only 1/nth of its energy.",
                "Thus, if there are 5 members in a group, we save 80% energy, which is huge.",
                "More energy can be saved by increasing the group size.",
                "We now present an alternate data storage scheme that aims at saving memory at the cost of energy.",
                "In this scheme we divide the group into what we call partitions.",
                "Partitions can be thought of as subgroups within a group.",
                "Each partition must have at least two nodes in it.",
                "The nodes within a partition are called peers.",
                "Each partition has one peer designated as partition leader.",
                "The partition leader stays in receive mode at all times, while all others peers a partition stay in the sleep mode.",
                "Partition leadership is time-multiplexed among the peers to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery.",
                "Like before, a group has exactly one leader and the leadership is time-multiplexed among partitions.",
                "The group leader also serves as the partition leader for the partition it belongs to (See Figure 11).",
                "In this scheme, all partition leaders participate in information exchange.",
                "Whenever a group comes across an external node e, every partition leader receives all witness information, but it only stores a subset of that information after filtering.",
                "Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send witness information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to.",
                "However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode.",
                "Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their witness information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide.",
                "All this is achieved by having the group leader send a signal to every partition leader in turn. 186 Figure 11: The figure shows a group of eight nodes divided into four partitions of 2 nodes each.",
                "Node 1 is the group leader whereas nodes 2, 9, and 7 are partition leaders.",
                "All other nodes are in the sleep mode.",
                "Since the partition leadership is time-multiplexed, it is important that any information received by the partition leader, p1, be passed on to the next leader, p2.",
                "This has to be done to make sure that p2 has all the information that it might need to send when it comes across another external node during its timeslot.",
                "One way of achieving this is to wake p2 up just before p1s timeslot expires and then have p1 transfer information only to p2.",
                "An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers.",
                "Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep.",
                "In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information.",
                "In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes.",
                "In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers.",
                "Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one.",
                "A group can be divided into partitions in more than one way.",
                "For example, suppose we have a group of six members.",
                "We can divide this group into three partitions of two peers each, or two partitions with three peers each.",
                "The choice once again depends on the requirements of the system.",
                "A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient.",
                "This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time.",
                "On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12).",
                "A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery.",
                "This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node.",
                "For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node.",
                "Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all witness information stored in that partition will be lost.",
                "We have devised a very simple protocol to solve this problem.",
                "We first explain how partiFigure 12: The figure shows two different ways of partitioning a group of six nodes.",
                "In (a), a group is divided into three partitions of two nodes.",

                "Suppose node 2 in figure 3 (a) dies.",
                "When node 5, the partition leader, sends information to node 2, it does not receive an acknowledgement from it and concludes that node 2 has died2 .",
                "At this point, node 5 contacts other partition leaders (nodes 1 ... 9) using a broadcast message and informs them that one of its peers has died.",
                "Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of witness information stored in its partition.",
                "Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders.",
                "Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition.",
                "However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition.",
                "It chooses the partition that has the least amount of witness information to join.",
                "It sends its witness information to the new partition leader.",
                "Witness information and membership update is propagated to all peers during the next partition leadership change.",
                "We now consider the case where the partition leader dies.",

                "Once the new partition leader finds out that it needs more peers, it proceeds with the protocol explained above.",
                "However, in this case, we do lose information that the previous partition leader might have received just before it died.",

                "SYSTEM EVALUATION A sensor is constrained in the amount of memory and power.",
                "In general, the amount of memory needed and power consumption depends on a variety of factors such as node density, number of hiker encounters, and the number of access points.",

                "The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh.",

                "OTHER APPLICATIONS In addition to the hiking in wilderness areas, CenWits can be used in several other applications, e.g. skiing, climbing, wild life monitoring, and person tracking.",
                "Since CenWits relies only on intermittent connectivity, it can take advantage of the existing cheap and mature technologies, and thereby make tracking cheaper and fairly accurate.",

                "But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain.",
                "Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries.",
                "These boundary sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff.",
                "Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs.",
                "If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier.",
                "If there is no witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.",
                "In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals.",
                "To collect data, either a satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver.",
                "GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2].",
                "Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds.",
                "Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it.",
                "Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of deers.",
                "CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces.",
                "CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case.",
                "Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data.",

                "They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.",
                "In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesnt work indoor and near skyscrapers.",
                "If a person A is reported missing, and from the witness records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 8.",
                "DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new search and rescue system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current search and rescue systems.",
                "These advantages include a looselycoupled system that relies only on intermittent network connectivity, power and storage efficiency, and low cost.",
                "It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
                "It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies.",
                "A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.",
                "In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.",
                "An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.",
                "This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.",
                "We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.",
                "While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system.",
                "We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present.",
                "Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.",
                "There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.",
                "For example, an adversary can sniff the witness information to locate endangered animals, females, children, etc.",
                "He may inject false information in the system.",
                "An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.",
                "In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.",
                "So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.",
                "However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.",
                "Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.",
                "In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.",
                "Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.",
                "So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.",
                "Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment.",
                "In particular, discussions are currenly underway to deploy CenWits in the Rocky Mountain and Yosemite National Parks. 9.",

                "It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation.",
                "With the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc.",
                "All these systems require a connected network via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices.",
                "This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.",
                "For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.",
                "As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.",
                "While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.",
                "Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car.",
                "An <br>rf transmitter</br> has a relatively smaller range of transmission.",
                "So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area.",
                "In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.",
                "In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.",
                "In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).",
                "CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors.",
                "A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location.",
                "The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world.",
                "This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.",
                "In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.",
                "In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network.",
                "Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network.",
                "As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.",
                "Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective.",
                "A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.",
                "The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions.",
                "Groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.",
                "Using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information.",
                "In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.",
                "Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.",
                "It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.",
                "This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors.",
                "The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.",
                "However, these techniques are quite general.",
                "We discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques.",
                "While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.",
                "First, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not require a connected network.",
                "Second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization.",
                "Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we overview some of the recent projects and technologies related to movement and location tracking, and search and rescue systems.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the overall architecture of CenWits, and provide a high-level description of its functionality.",
                "In the next section, Section 4, we discuss power and memory management in CenWits.",
                "To simplify our presentation, we will focus on a specific application of tracking lost/injured hikers in all these sections.",
                "In Section 6, we describe a prototype implementation of CenWits and present performance measured from this implementation.",
                "We discuss how the ideas of CenWits can be used to build several other applications in Section 7.",
                "Finally, in Section 8, we discuss some related issues and conclude the paper. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK A survey of location systems for ubiquitous computing is provided in [11].",

                "Because of the popularity and low cost of 802.11 devices, several business solutions based on this technology have been developed[1].",
                "A system that combines two mature technologies and is viable in suburban area where a user can see clear sky and has GSM cellular reception at the same time is currently available[5].",
                "This system receives GPS signal from a satellite and locates itself, draws location on a map, and sends location information through GSM network to the others who are interested in the users location.",

                "Luxury version of PLB combines a GPS receiver and a COSPASSARSAT satellite transmitter that can transmit users location in latitude and longitude to the rescue team whenever an accident happens [4].",
                "However, the device either is turned on all the time resulting in fast battery drain, or must be turned on after the accident to function.",
                "Another related technology in widespread use today is the ONSTAR system [3], typically used in several luxury cars.",
                "In this system, a GPS unit provides position information, and a powerful transmitter relays that information via satellite to a customer service center.",
                "Designed for emergencies, the system can be triggered either by the user with the push of a button, or by a catastrophic accident.",
                "Once the system has been triggered, a human representative attempts to gain communication with the user via a cell phone built as an incar device.",
                "If contact cannot be made, emergency services are dispatched to the location provided by GPS.",
                "Like PLBs, this system has several limitations.",
                "First, it is heavy and expensive.",
                "It requires a satellite transmitter and a connected network.",
                "If connectivity with either the GPS network or a communication satellite cannot be maintained, the system fails.",
                "Unfortunately, these are common obstacles encountered in deep canyons, narrow streets in large cities, parking garages, and a number of other places. 181 The Lifetch system uses GPS receiver board combined with a GSM/GPRS transmitter and an <br>rf transmitter</br> in one wireless sensor node called Intelligent Communication Unit (ICU).",
                "An ICU first attempts to transmit its location to a control center through GSM/GPRS network.",
                "If that fails, it connects with other ICUs (adhoc network) to forward its location information until the information reaches an ICU that has GSM/GPRS reception.",
                "This ICU then transmits the location information of the original ICU via the GSM/GPRS network.",
                "ZebraNet is a system designed to study the moving patterns of zebras [13].",
                "It utilizes two protocols: History-based protocol and flooding protocol.",
                "History-based protocol is used when the zebras are grazing and not moving around too much.",
                "While this might be useful for tracking zebras, its not suitable for tracking hikers because two hikers are most likely to meet each other only once on a trail.",
                "In the flooding protocol, a node dumps its data to a neighbor whenever it finds one and doesnt delete its own copy until it finds a base station.",
                "Without considering routing loops, packet filtering and grouping, the size of data on a node will grow exponentially and drain the power and memory of a sensor node with in a short time.",
                "Instead, Cenwits uses a four-phase hand-shake protocol to ensure that a node transmits only as much information as the other node is willing to receive.",
                "While ZebraNet is designed for a big group of sensors moving together in the same direction with same speed, Cenwits is designed to be used in the scenario where sensors move in different directions at different speeds.",
                "Delay tolerant network architecture addresses some important problems in challenged (resource-constrained) networks [9].",
                "While this work is mainly concerned with interoperability of challenged networks, some problems related to occasionally-connected networks are similar to the ones we have addressed in CenWits.",
                "Among all these systems, luxury PLB and Lifetch are designed for location tracking in wilderness areas.",
                "However, both of these systems require a connected network.",
                "Luxury PLB requires the user to transmit a signal to a satellite, while Lifetch requires connection to GSM/GPRS network.",
                "Luxury PLB transmits location information, only when an accident happens.",
                "However, if the user is buried in the snow or falls into a deep canyon, there is almost no chance for the signal to go through and be relayed to the rescue team.",
                "This is because satellite transmission needs line of sight.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no known history of users location, it is not possible for the rescue team to infer the current location of the user.",
                "Another disadvantage of luxury PLB is that a satellite transmitter is very expensive, costing in the range of $750.",
                "Lifetch attempts to transmit the location information by GSM/GPRS and adhoc sensor network that uses AODV as the routing protocol.",
                "However, having a cellular reception in remote areas in wilderness areas, e.g.",
                "American national parks is unlikely.",
                "Furthermore, it is extremely unlikely that ICUs worn by hikers will be able to form an adhoc network in a large wilderness area.",
                "This is because the hikers are mobile and it is very unlikely to have several ICUs placed dense enough to forward packets even on a very popular hike route.",
                "CenWits is designed to address the limitations of systems such as luxury PLB and Lifetch.",
                "It is designed to provide hikers, skiers, and climbers who have their activities mainly in wilderness areas a much higher chance to convey their location information to a control center.",
                "It is not reliant upon constant connectivity with any communication medium.",
                "Rather, it communicates information along from user to user, finally arriving at a control center.",
                "Unlike several of the systems discussed so far, it does not require that a users unit is constantly turned on.",
                "In fact, it can discover a victims location, even if the victims sensor was off at the time of accident and has remained off since then.",
                "CenWits solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",

                "CENWITS We describe CenWits in the context of locating lost/injured hikers in wilderness areas.",
                "Each hiker wears a sensor (MICA2 motes in our prototype) equipped with a GPS receiver and an <br>rf transmitter</br>.",
                "Each sensor is assigned a unique ID and maintains its current location based on the signal received by its GPS receiver.",
                "It also emits beacons periodically.",
                "When any two sensors are in the range of one another, they record the presence of each other (witness information), and also exchange the witness information they recorded earlier.",
                "The key idea here is that if two sensors come with in range of each other at any time, they become each others witnesses.",
                "Later on, if the hiker wearing one of these sensors is lost, the other sensor can convey the last known (witnessed) location of the lost hiker.",
                "Furthermore, by exchanging the witness information that each sensor recorded earlier, the witness information is propagated beyond a direct contact between two sensors.",
                "To convey witness information to a processing center or to a rescue team, access points are established at well-known locations that the hikers are expected to pass through, e.g. at the trail heads, trail ends, intersection of different trails, scenic view points, resting areas, and so on.",
                "Whenever a sensor node is in the vicinity of an access point, all witness information stored in that sensor is automatically dumped to the access point.",
                "Access points are connected to a processing center via satellite or some other network1 .",
                "The witness information is downloaded to the processing center from various access points at regular intervals.",
                "In case, connection to an access point is lost, the information from that 1 A connection is needed only between access points and a processing center.",
                "There is no need for any connection between different access points. 182 access point can be downloaded manually, e.g. by UAVs.",
                "To estimate the speed, location and direction of a hiker at any point in time, all witness information of that hiker that has been collected from various access points is processed.",
                "Figure 2: Hiker A and Hiker B are in the range of each other.",
                "A records the presence of B and B records the presence of A.",
                "A and B become each others witnesses.",
                "Figure 3: Hiker A is in the range of an access point.",
                "It uploads its recorded witness information and clears its memory.",
                "An example of how CenWits operates is illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3.",
                "First, hikers A and B are on two close trails, but out of range of each other (Figure 1).",
                "This is a very common scenario during a hike.",
                "For example, on a popular four-hour hike, a hiker might run into as many as 20 other hikers.",
                "This accounts for one encounter every 12 minutes on average.",
                "A slow hiker can go 1 mile (5,280 feet) per hour.",
                "Thus in 12 minutes a slow hiker can go as far as 1056 feet.",
                "This implies that if we were to put 20 hikers on a 4-hour, one-way hike evenly, the range of each sensor node should be at least 1056 feet for them to communicate with one another continuously.",
                "The signal strength starts dropping rapidly for two Mica2 nodes to communicate with each other when they are 180 feet away, and is completely lost when they are 230 feet away from each other[7].",
                "So, for the sensors to form a sensor network on a 4-hour hiking trail, there should be at least 120 hikers scattered evenly.",
                "Clearly, this is extremely unlikely.",
                "In fact, in a 4-hour, less-popular hiking trail, one might only run into say five other hikers.",
                "CenWits takes advantage of the fact that sensors can communicate with one another and record their presence.",
                "Given a walking speed of one mile per hour (88 feet per minute) and Mica2 range of about 150 feet for non-line-of-sight radio transmission, two hikers have about 150/88 = 1.7 minutes to discover the presence of each other and exchange their witness information.",
                "We therefore design our system to have each sensor emit a beacon every one-and-a-half minute.",
                "In Figure 2, hiker Bs sensor emits a beacon when A is in range, this triggers A to exchange data with B.",
                "A communicates the following information to B: My ID is A; I saw C at 1:23 PM at (39◦ 49.3277655, 105◦ 39.1126776), I saw E at 3:09 PM at (40◦ 49.2234879, 105◦ 20.3290168).",
                "B then replies with My ID is B; I saw K at 11:20 AM at (39◦ 51.4531655, 105◦ 41.6776223).",
                "In addition, A records I saw B at 4:17 PM at (41◦ 29.3177354, 105◦ 04.9106211) and B records I saw A at 4:17 PM at (41◦ 29.3177354, 105◦ 04.9106211).",
                "B goes on his way to overnight camping while A heads back to trail head where there is an AP, which emits beacon every 5 seconds to avoid missing any hiker.",

                "This is shown in Figure 3. 3.1 Witness Information: Storage A critical concern is that there is limited amount of memory available on motes (4 KB SDRAM memory, 128 KB flash memory, and 4-512 KB EEPROM).",
                "So, it is important to organize witness information efficiently.",

                "Each node is assigned a unique Node Id when it enters a trail.",
                "In our current prototype, we have allocated one byte for Node Id, although this can be increased to two or more bytes if a large number of hikers are expected to be present at the same time.",
                "We can represent time in 17 bits to a second precision.",
                "So, we have allocated 3 bytes each for Record Time and Location Time.",
                "The circumference of the Earth is approximately 40,075 KM.",
                "If we use a 32-bit number to represent both longitude and latitude, the precision we get is 40,075,000/232 = 0.0093 meter = 0.37 inches, which is quite precise for our needs.",
                "So, we have allocated 4 bytes each for X and Y coordinates of the location of a node.",
                "In fact, a foot precision can be achieved by using only 27 bits. 3.2 Location Point and Location Inference Although a GPS receiver provides an accurate location information, it has its limitation.",
                "In canyons and rainy forests, a GPS receiver does not work.",
                "When there is a heavy cloud cover, GPS users have experienced inaccuracy in the reported location as well.",
                "Unfortunately, a lot of hiking trails are in dense forests and canyons, and its not that uncommon to rain after hikers start hiking.",
                "To address this, CenWits incorporates the idea of location points (LP).",
                "A location point can update a sensor node with its current location whenever the node is near that LP.",
                "LPs are placed at different locations in a wilderness area where GPS receivers dont work.",
                "An LP is a very simple device that emits prerecorded location information at some regular time interval.",
                "It can be placed in difficult-to-reach places such as deep canyons and dense rain forests by simply dropping them from an airplane.",
                "LPs allow a sensor node to determine its current location more accurately.",
                "However, they are not 183 an essential requirement of CenWits.",
                "If an LP runs out of power, the CenWits will continue to work correctly.",
                "Figure 5: GPS receiver not working correctly.",
                "Sensors then have to rely on LP to provide coordination In Figure 5, B cannot get GPS reception due to bad weather.",
                "It then runs into A on the trail who doesnt have GPS reception either.",
                "Their sensors record the presence of each other.",
                "After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A.",
                "When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter location of A and B.",
                "By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be inferred.",
                "Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).",
                "Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.",
                "CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.",
                "Such a synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available.",
                "In addition, sensor nodes in CenWits synchronize their clocks whenever they are in the range of an AP or an LP.",
                "The Figure 8: Based on overlapping landscape, B might have hiked to wrong branch and fallen off a cliff.",
                "Hot rescue areas can thus be determined synchronization accuracy Cenwits needs is of the order of a second or so.",
                "As long as the clocks are synchronized with in one second range, whether A met B at 12:3745 or 12:3746 doesnt matter in the ordering of witness events and inferring the path. 4.",
                "MEMORY AND POWER MANAGEMENT CenWits employs several important mechanisms to conserve power and memory.",
                "It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory.",
                "With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of witness information stored at a node can get very large.",
                "This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of witness information over time.",
                "To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically.",
                "This raises an interesting question of when and which witness record should be deleted from the memory of a node?",
                "CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap.",
                "Record count refers to the number of witness records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT.",
                "It stores at most MAX RECORD COUNT witness records of any node.",
                "Every witness record has a hop count field that stores the number times (hops) this record has been transferred since being created.",
                "Initially this field is set to 0.",
                "Whenever a node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.",
                "We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet.",
                "The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up.",
                "For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes.",
                "On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node.",
                "Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two witness records with the same node id.",
                "To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two witness records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "For each node id i, n stores the witness record with the most recent record time rti, the witness with most recent record time that is at least MIN RECORD GAP time units before rti, and so on until the record count limit (MAX RECORD COUNT) is reached.",
                "When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory.",
                "It decrements MAX RECORD COUNT and MAX HOP COUNT, and increments MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "It then first erases all witness records whose hop count exceeds the reduced MAX HOP COUNT value, and then erases witness records to satisfy the record gap criteria.",
                "Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its witness information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions.",
                "For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a beacon every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour.",
                "However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a beacon should be emitted every 10 seconds.",
                "If a user is not moving at all, a beacon can be emitted every 10 minutes.",
                "In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time.",
                "If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy.",
                "In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals.",
                "For example, suppose hiker A has communicated its witness information to three other hikers in the last five minutes.",
                "If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional witness information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to sleep mode if it is extremely low on power.",
                "The bandwidth and energy limitations of sensor nodes require that the amount of data transferred among the nodes be reduced to minimum.",
                "It has been observed that in some scenarios 3000 instructions could be executed for the same energy cost of sending a bit 100m by radio [15].",
                "To reduce the amount of data transfer, CenWits employs a handshake protocol that two nodes execute when they encounter one another.",
                "The goal of this protocol is to ensure that a node transmits only as much witness information as the other node is willing to receive.",
                "This protocol is initiated when a node i receives a beacon containing the node ID of the sender node j and i has not exchanged witness information with j in the last δ time units.",
                "Assume that i < j.",
                "The protocol consists of four phases (See Figure 9): 1.",
                "Phase I: Node i sends its receive constraints and the number of witness records it has in its memory. 2.",
                "Phase II: On receiving this message from i, j sends its receive constraints and the number of witness records it has in its memory. 3.",
                "Phase III: On receiving the above message from j, i sends its witness information (filtered based on receive constraints received in phase II). 4.",
                "Phase IV: After receiving the witness records from i, j sends its witness information (filtered based on receive constraints received in phase I). j <Constaints, Witness info size> <Constaints, Witness info size> <Filtered Witness info> <Filtered Witness info> i j j j i i i Figure 9: Four-Phase Hand Shake Protocol (i < j) Receive constraints are a function of memory and power.",
                "In the most general case, they are comprised of the three parameters (record count, hop count and record gap) used for memory management.",
                "If i is low on memory, it specifies the maximum number of records it is willing to accept from j.",
                "Similarly, i can ask j to send only those records that have hop count value less than MAX HOP COUNT − 1.",
                "Finally, i can include its MIN RECORD GAP value in its receive constraints.",
                "Note that the handshake protocol is beneficial to both i and j.",
                "They save memory by receiving only as much information as they are willing to accept and conserve energy by sending only as many witness records as needed.",
                "It turns out that filtering witness records based on MIN RECORD GAP is complex.",
                "It requires that the witness records of any given node be arranged in an order sorted by their record time values.",
                "Maintaining this sorted order is complex in memory, because new witness records with the same node id can arrive later that may have to be inserted in between to preserve the sorted order.",
                "For this reason, the receive constraints in the current CenWits prototype do not include record gap.",
                "Suppose i specifies a hop count value of 3.",
                "In this case, j checks the hop count field of every witness record before sending them.",
                "If the hop count value is greater than 3, the record is not transmitted. 4.3 Groups and Partitions To further reduce communication and increase the lifetime of our system, we introduce the notion of groups.",
                "The idea is based on the concept of abstract regions presented in [20].",
                "A group is a set of n nodes that can be defined in terms of radio connectivity, geographic location, or other properties of nodes.",
                "All nodes within a group can communicate directly with one another and they share information to maintain their view of the external world.",
                "At any point in time, a group has exactly one leader that communicates 185 with external nodes on behalf of the entire group.",
                "A group can be static, meaning that the group membership does not change over the period of time, or it could be dynamic in which case nodes can leave or join the group.",
                "To make our analysis simple and to explain the advantages of group, we first discuss static groups.",
                "A static group is formed at the start of a hiking trail or ski slope.",
                "Suppose there are five family members who want to go for a hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park.",
                "Before these members start their hike, each one of them is given a sensor node and the information is entered in the system that the five nodes form a group.",
                "Each group member is given a unique id and every group member knows about other members of the group.",
                "The group, as a whole, is also assigned an id to distinguish it from other groups in the system.",
                "Figure 10: A group of five people.",
                "Node 2 is the group leader and it is communicating on behalf of the group with an external node 17.",
                "All other (shown in a lighter shade) are in sleep mode.",
                "As the group moves through the trail, it exchanges information with other nodes or groups that it comes across.",
                "At any point in time, only one group member, called the leader, sends and receives information on behalf of the group and all other n − 1 group members are put in the sleep mode (See Figure 10).",
                "It is this property of groups that saves us energy.",
                "The group leadership is time-multiplexed among the group members.",
                "This is done to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery due to continuous exchange of information.",
                "Thus after every t seconds, the leadership is passed on to another node, called the successor, and the leader (now an ordinary member) is put to sleep.",
                "Since energy is dear, we do not implement an extensive election algorithm for choosing the successor.",
                "Instead, we choose the successor on the basis of node id.",
                "The node with the next highest id in the group is chosen as the successor.",
                "The last node, of course, chooses the node with the lowest id as its successor.",
                "We now discuss the data storage schemes for groups.",
                "Memory is a scarce resource in sensor nodes and it is therefore important that witness information be stored efficiently among group members.",
                "Efficient data storage is not a trivial task when it comes to groups.",
                "The tradeoff is between simplicity of the scheme and memory savings.",
                "A simpler scheme incurs lesser energy cost as compared to a more sophisticated scheme, but offers lesser memory savings as well.",
                "This is because in a more complicated scheme, the group members have to coordinate to update and store information.",
                "After considering a number of different schemes, we have come to a conclusion that there is no optimal storage scheme for groups.",
                "The system should be able to adapt according to its requirements.",
                "If group members are low on battery, then the group can adapt a scheme that is more energy efficient.",
                "Similarly, if the group members are running out of memory, they can adapt a scheme that is more memory efficient.",
                "We first present a simple scheme that is very energy efficient but does not offer significant memory savings.",
                "We then present an alternate scheme that is much more memory efficient.",
                "As already mentioned a group can receive information only through the group leader.",
                "Whenever the leader comes across an external node e, it receives information from that node and saves it.",
                "In our first scheme, when the timeslot for the leader expires, the leader passes this new information it received from e to its successor.",
                "This is important because during the next time slot, if the new leader comes across another external node, it should be able to pass information about all the external nodes this group has witnessed so far.",
                "Thus the information is fully replicated on all nodes to maintain the correct view of the world.",
                "Our first scheme does not offer any memory savings but is highly energy efficient and may be a good choice when the group members are running low on battery.",
                "Except for the time when the leadership is switched, all n − 1 members are asleep at any given time.",
                "This means that a single member is up for t seconds once every n∗t seconds and therefore has to spend approximately only 1/nth of its energy.",
                "Thus, if there are 5 members in a group, we save 80% energy, which is huge.",
                "More energy can be saved by increasing the group size.",
                "We now present an alternate data storage scheme that aims at saving memory at the cost of energy.",
                "In this scheme we divide the group into what we call partitions.",
                "Partitions can be thought of as subgroups within a group.",
                "Each partition must have at least two nodes in it.",
                "The nodes within a partition are called peers.",
                "Each partition has one peer designated as partition leader.",
                "The partition leader stays in receive mode at all times, while all others peers a partition stay in the sleep mode.",
                "Partition leadership is time-multiplexed among the peers to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery.",
                "Like before, a group has exactly one leader and the leadership is time-multiplexed among partitions.",
                "The group leader also serves as the partition leader for the partition it belongs to (See Figure 11).",
                "In this scheme, all partition leaders participate in information exchange.",
                "Whenever a group comes across an external node e, every partition leader receives all witness information, but it only stores a subset of that information after filtering.",
                "Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send witness information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to.",
                "However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode.",
                "Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their witness information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide.",
                "All this is achieved by having the group leader send a signal to every partition leader in turn. 186 Figure 11: The figure shows a group of eight nodes divided into four partitions of 2 nodes each.",
                "Node 1 is the group leader whereas nodes 2, 9, and 7 are partition leaders.",
                "All other nodes are in the sleep mode.",
                "Since the partition leadership is time-multiplexed, it is important that any information received by the partition leader, p1, be passed on to the next leader, p2.",
                "This has to be done to make sure that p2 has all the information that it might need to send when it comes across another external node during its timeslot.",
                "One way of achieving this is to wake p2 up just before p1s timeslot expires and then have p1 transfer information only to p2.",
                "An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers.",
                "Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep.",
                "In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information.",
                "In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes.",
                "In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers.",
                "Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one.",
                "A group can be divided into partitions in more than one way.",
                "For example, suppose we have a group of six members.",
                "We can divide this group into three partitions of two peers each, or two partitions with three peers each.",
                "The choice once again depends on the requirements of the system.",
                "A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient.",
                "This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time.",
                "On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12).",
                "A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery.",
                "This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node.",
                "For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node.",
                "Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all witness information stored in that partition will be lost.",
                "We have devised a very simple protocol to solve this problem.",
                "We first explain how partiFigure 12: The figure shows two different ways of partitioning a group of six nodes.",

                "Suppose node 2 in figure 3 (a) dies.",
                "When node 5, the partition leader, sends information to node 2, it does not receive an acknowledgement from it and concludes that node 2 has died2 .",
                "At this point, node 5 contacts other partition leaders (nodes 1 ... 9) using a broadcast message and informs them that one of its peers has died.",
                "Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of witness information stored in its partition.",
                "Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders.",
                "Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition.",
                "However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition.",
                "It chooses the partition that has the least amount of witness information to join.",
                "It sends its witness information to the new partition leader.",

                "Once the new partition leader finds out that it needs more peers, it proceeds with the protocol explained above.",
                "However, in this case, we do lose information that the previous partition leader might have received just before it died.",

                "SYSTEM EVALUATION A sensor is constrained in the amount of memory and power.",
                "In general, the amount of memory needed and power consumption depends on a variety of factors such as node density, number of hiker encounters, and the number of access points.",

                "Since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take 0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34 seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link.",
                "The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh.",

                "OTHER APPLICATIONS In addition to the hiking in wilderness areas, CenWits can be used in several other applications, e.g. skiing, climbing, wild life monitoring, and person tracking.",
                "Since CenWits relies only on intermittent connectivity, it can take advantage of the existing cheap and mature technologies, and thereby make tracking cheaper and fairly accurate.",
                "Since CenWits doesnt rely on keeping track of a sensor holder all time, but relies on maintaining witnesses, the system is relatively cheaper and widely applicable.",
                "For example, there are some dangerous cliffs in most ski resorts.",
                "But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain.",
                "Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries.",
                "These boundary sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff.",
                "Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs.",
                "If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier.",
                "If there is no witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.",
                "In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals.",
                "To collect data, either a satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver.",
                "GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2].",
                "Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds.",
                "Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it.",
                "Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of deers.",
                "CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces.",
                "CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case.",
                "Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data.",
                "In fact, the access points need not be statically located.",
                "They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.",
                "In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesnt work indoor and near skyscrapers.",
                "If a person A is reported missing, and from the witness records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 8.",
                "DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new search and rescue system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current search and rescue systems.",
                "These advantages include a looselycoupled system that relies only on intermittent network connectivity, power and storage efficiency, and low cost.",
                "It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
                "It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies.",
                "A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.",
                "In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.",
                "An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.",
                "This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.",
                "We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.",
                "While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system.",
                "We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present.",
                "Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.",
                "There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.",
                "For example, an adversary can sniff the witness information to locate endangered animals, females, children, etc.",
                "He may inject false information in the system.",
                "An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.",
                "In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.",
                "So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.",
                "However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.",
                "Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.",
                "In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.",
                "Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.",
                "So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.",
                "Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment.",
                "In particular, discussions are currenly underway to deploy CenWits in the Rocky Mountain and Yosemite National Parks. 9.",

                "CenWits uses several small, commonly-available RF-based sensors, and a small number of storage and processing devices.",
                "It is designed for search and rescue of people in emergency situations in wilderness areas.",
                "A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation.",
                "It is designed for an intermittently connected network that provides only occasional connectivity.",
                "It makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "A prototype of CenWits has been implemented using Berkeley Mica2 motes.",
                "The paper describes this implementation and reports on the performance measured from it.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Computer-Communication Networks]: Distributed Systems General Terms Algorithms, Design, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Search and rescue of people in emergency situation in a timely manner is an extremely important service.",
                "It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation.",
                "With the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc.",
                "All these systems require a connected network via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices.",
                "This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.",
                "For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.",
                "As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.",
                "While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.",
                "Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car.",
                "An RF transmitter has a relatively smaller range of transmission.",
                "So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area.",
                "In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.",
                "In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.",
                "In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).",
                "CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors.",
                "A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location.",
                "The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world.",
                "This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.",
                "In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.",
                "In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network.",
                "Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network.",
                "As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.",
                "Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective.",
                "A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.",
                "The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions.",
                "Groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.",
                "Using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information.",
                "In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.",
                "Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.",
                "It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.",
                "This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors.",
                "The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.",
                "However, these techniques are quite general.",
                "We discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques.",
                "While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.",
                "First, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not require a connected network.",
                "Second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization.",
                "Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we overview some of the recent projects and technologies related to movement and location tracking, and search and rescue systems.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the overall architecture of CenWits, and provide a high-level description of its functionality.",
                "In the next section, Section 4, we discuss power and memory management in CenWits.",
                "To simplify our presentation, we will focus on a specific application of tracking lost/injured hikers in all these sections.",
                "In Section 6, we describe a prototype implementation of CenWits and present performance measured from this implementation.",
                "We discuss how the ideas of CenWits can be used to build several other applications in Section 7.",
                "Finally, in Section 8, we discuss some related issues and conclude the paper. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK A survey of location systems for ubiquitous computing is provided in [11].",

                "Locationing using 802.11 devices is probably the cheapest solution for indoor position tracking [8].",
                "Because of the popularity and low cost of 802.11 devices, several business solutions based on this technology have been developed[1].",
                "A system that combines two mature technologies and is viable in suburban area where a user can see clear sky and has GSM cellular reception at the same time is currently available[5].",

                "Luxury version of PLB combines a GPS receiver and a COSPASSARSAT satellite transmitter that can transmit users location in latitude and longitude to the rescue team whenever an accident happens [4].",
                "However, the device either is turned on all the time resulting in fast battery drain, or must be turned on after the accident to function.",
                "Another related technology in widespread use today is the ONSTAR system [3], typically used in several luxury cars.",
                "In this system, a GPS unit provides position information, and a powerful transmitter relays that information via satellite to a customer service center.",
                "Designed for emergencies, the system can be triggered either by the user with the push of a button, or by a catastrophic accident.",
                "Once the system has been triggered, a human representative attempts to gain communication with the user via a cell phone built as an incar device.",
                "If contact cannot be made, emergency services are dispatched to the location provided by GPS.",
                "Like PLBs, this system has several limitations.",
                "First, it is heavy and expensive.",
                "It requires a satellite transmitter and a connected network.",
                "If connectivity with either the GPS network or a communication satellite cannot be maintained, the system fails.",
                "Unfortunately, these are common obstacles encountered in deep canyons, narrow streets in large cities, parking garages, and a number of other places. 181 The Lifetch system uses GPS receiver board combined with a GSM/GPRS transmitter and an RF transmitter in one wireless sensor node called Intelligent Communication Unit (ICU).",
                "An ICU first attempts to transmit its location to a control center through GSM/GPRS network.",
                "If that fails, it connects with other ICUs (adhoc network) to forward its location information until the information reaches an ICU that has GSM/GPRS reception.",
                "This ICU then transmits the location information of the original ICU via the GSM/GPRS network.",
                "ZebraNet is a system designed to study the moving patterns of zebras [13].",
                "It utilizes two protocols: History-based protocol and flooding protocol.",
                "History-based protocol is used when the zebras are grazing and not moving around too much.",
                "While this might be useful for tracking zebras, its not suitable for tracking hikers because two hikers are most likely to meet each other only once on a trail.",
                "In the flooding protocol, a node dumps its data to a neighbor whenever it finds one and doesnt delete its own copy until it finds a base station.",
                "Without considering routing loops, packet filtering and grouping, the size of data on a node will grow exponentially and drain the power and memory of a sensor node with in a short time.",
                "Instead, Cenwits uses a four-phase hand-shake protocol to ensure that a node transmits only as much information as the other node is willing to receive.",
                "While ZebraNet is designed for a big group of sensors moving together in the same direction with same speed, Cenwits is designed to be used in the scenario where sensors move in different directions at different speeds.",
                "Delay tolerant network architecture addresses some important problems in challenged (resource-constrained) networks [9].",
                "While this work is mainly concerned with interoperability of challenged networks, some problems related to occasionally-connected networks are similar to the ones we have addressed in CenWits.",
                "Among all these systems, luxury PLB and Lifetch are designed for location tracking in wilderness areas.",
                "However, both of these systems require a connected network.",
                "Luxury PLB requires the user to transmit a signal to a satellite, while Lifetch requires connection to GSM/GPRS network.",
                "Luxury PLB transmits location information, only when an accident happens.",
                "However, if the user is buried in the snow or falls into a deep canyon, there is almost no chance for the signal to go through and be relayed to the rescue team.",
                "This is because satellite transmission needs line of sight.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no known history of users location, it is not possible for the rescue team to infer the current location of the user.",
                "Another disadvantage of luxury PLB is that a satellite transmitter is very expensive, costing in the range of $750.",
                "Lifetch attempts to transmit the location information by GSM/GPRS and adhoc sensor network that uses AODV as the routing protocol.",
                "However, having a cellular reception in remote areas in wilderness areas, e.g.",
                "American national parks is unlikely.",
                "Furthermore, it is extremely unlikely that ICUs worn by hikers will be able to form an adhoc network in a large wilderness area.",
                "This is because the hikers are mobile and it is very unlikely to have several ICUs placed dense enough to forward packets even on a very popular hike route.",
                "CenWits is designed to address the limitations of systems such as luxury PLB and Lifetch.",
                "It is designed to provide hikers, skiers, and climbers who have their activities mainly in wilderness areas a much higher chance to convey their location information to a control center.",
                "It is not reliant upon constant connectivity with any communication medium.",
                "Rather, it communicates information along from user to user, finally arriving at a control center.",
                "Unlike several of the systems discussed so far, it does not require that a users unit is constantly turned on.",
                "In fact, it can discover a victims location, even if the victims sensor was off at the time of accident and has remained off since then.",
                "CenWits solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
                "Figure 1: Hiker A and Hiker B are are not in the range of each other 3.",
                "CENWITS We describe CenWits in the context of locating lost/injured hikers in wilderness areas.",
                "Each hiker wears a sensor (MICA2 motes in our prototype) equipped with a GPS receiver and an RF transmitter.",
                "Each sensor is assigned a unique ID and maintains its current location based on the signal received by its GPS receiver.",
                "It also emits beacons periodically.",
                "When any two sensors are in the range of one another, they record the presence of each other (witness information), and also exchange the witness information they recorded earlier.",
                "The key idea here is that if two sensors come with in range of each other at any time, they become each others witnesses.",
                "Later on, if the hiker wearing one of these sensors is lost, the other sensor can convey the last known (witnessed) location of the lost hiker.",
                "Furthermore, by exchanging the witness information that each sensor recorded earlier, the witness information is propagated beyond a direct contact between two sensors.",
                "To convey witness information to a processing center or to a rescue team, access points are established at well-known locations that the hikers are expected to pass through, e.g. at the trail heads, trail ends, intersection of different trails, scenic view points, resting areas, and so on.",
                "Whenever a sensor node is in the vicinity of an access point, all witness information stored in that sensor is automatically dumped to the access point.",
                "Access points are connected to a processing center via satellite or some other network1 .",
                "The witness information is downloaded to the processing center from various access points at regular intervals.",
                "In case, connection to an access point is lost, the information from that 1 A connection is needed only between access points and a processing center.",
                "There is no need for any connection between different access points. 182 access point can be downloaded manually, e.g. by UAVs.",
                "To estimate the speed, location and direction of a hiker at any point in time, all witness information of that hiker that has been collected from various access points is processed.",
                "Figure 2: Hiker A and Hiker B are in the range of each other.",
                "A records the presence of B and B records the presence of A.",
                "A and B become each others witnesses.",
                "Figure 3: Hiker A is in the range of an access point.",
                "It uploads its recorded witness information and clears its memory.",
                "An example of how CenWits operates is illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3.",
                "First, hikers A and B are on two close trails, but out of range of each other (Figure 1).",
                "This is a very common scenario during a hike.",
                "For example, on a popular four-hour hike, a hiker might run into as many as 20 other hikers.",
                "This accounts for one encounter every 12 minutes on average.",
                "A slow hiker can go 1 mile (5,280 feet) per hour.",
                "Thus in 12 minutes a slow hiker can go as far as 1056 feet.",
                "This implies that if we were to put 20 hikers on a 4-hour, one-way hike evenly, the range of each sensor node should be at least 1056 feet for them to communicate with one another continuously.",
                "The signal strength starts dropping rapidly for two Mica2 nodes to communicate with each other when they are 180 feet away, and is completely lost when they are 230 feet away from each other[7].",
                "So, for the sensors to form a sensor network on a 4-hour hiking trail, there should be at least 120 hikers scattered evenly.",
                "Clearly, this is extremely unlikely.",
                "In fact, in a 4-hour, less-popular hiking trail, one might only run into say five other hikers.",
                "CenWits takes advantage of the fact that sensors can communicate with one another and record their presence.",
                "Given a walking speed of one mile per hour (88 feet per minute) and Mica2 range of about 150 feet for non-line-of-sight radio transmission, two hikers have about 150/88 = 1.7 minutes to discover the presence of each other and exchange their witness information.",
                "We therefore design our system to have each sensor emit a <br>beacon</br> every one-and-a-half minute.",
                "In Figure 2, hiker Bs sensor emits a <br>beacon</br> when A is in range, this triggers A to exchange data with B.",
                "A communicates the following information to B: My ID is A; I saw C at 1:23 PM at (39◦ 49.3277655, 105◦ 39.1126776), I saw E at 3:09 PM at (40◦ 49.2234879, 105◦ 20.3290168).",
                "B then replies with My ID is B; I saw K at 11:20 AM at (39◦ 51.4531655, 105◦ 41.6776223).",
                "In addition, A records I saw B at 4:17 PM at (41◦ 29.3177354, 105◦ 04.9106211) and B records I saw A at 4:17 PM at (41◦ 29.3177354, 105◦ 04.9106211).",
                "B goes on his way to overnight camping while A heads back to trail head where there is an AP, which emits <br>beacon</br> every 5 seconds to avoid missing any hiker.",
                "A dumps all witness information it has collected to the access point.",
                "This is shown in Figure 3. 3.1 Witness Information: Storage A critical concern is that there is limited amount of memory available on motes (4 KB SDRAM memory, 128 KB flash memory, and 4-512 KB EEPROM).",
                "So, it is important to organize witness information efficiently.",
                "CenWits stores witness information at each node as a set of witness records (Format is shown in Figure 4. 1 B Node ID Record Time X, Y Location Time Hop Count 1 B 3 B 8 B 3 B Figure 4: Format of a witness record.",
                "When two nodes i and j encounter each other, each node generates a new witness record.",
                "In the witness record generated by i, Node ID is j, Record Time is the current time in is clock, (X,Y) are the coordinates of the location of i that i recorded most recently (either from satellite or an LP), Location Time is the time when the this location was recorded, and Hop Count is 0.",
                "Each node is assigned a unique Node Id when it enters a trail.",
                "In our current prototype, we have allocated one byte for Node Id, although this can be increased to two or more bytes if a large number of hikers are expected to be present at the same time.",
                "We can represent time in 17 bits to a second precision.",
                "So, we have allocated 3 bytes each for Record Time and Location Time.",
                "The circumference of the Earth is approximately 40,075 KM.",
                "If we use a 32-bit number to represent both longitude and latitude, the precision we get is 40,075,000/232 = 0.0093 meter = 0.37 inches, which is quite precise for our needs.",
                "So, we have allocated 4 bytes each for X and Y coordinates of the location of a node.",
                "In fact, a foot precision can be achieved by using only 27 bits. 3.2 Location Point and Location Inference Although a GPS receiver provides an accurate location information, it has its limitation.",
                "In canyons and rainy forests, a GPS receiver does not work.",
                "When there is a heavy cloud cover, GPS users have experienced inaccuracy in the reported location as well.",
                "Unfortunately, a lot of hiking trails are in dense forests and canyons, and its not that uncommon to rain after hikers start hiking.",
                "To address this, CenWits incorporates the idea of location points (LP).",
                "A location point can update a sensor node with its current location whenever the node is near that LP.",

                "Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).",
                "Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.",
                "CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.",

                "It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory.",
                "With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of witness information stored at a node can get very large.",
                "This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of witness information over time.",
                "To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically.",
                "This raises an interesting question of when and which witness record should be deleted from the memory of a node?",
                "CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap.",
                "Record count refers to the number of witness records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT.",
                "It stores at most MAX RECORD COUNT witness records of any node.",
                "Every witness record has a hop count field that stores the number times (hops) this record has been transferred since being created.",
                "Initially this field is set to 0.",
                "Whenever a node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.",
                "We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet.",
                "The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up.",
                "For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes.",
                "On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node.",
                "Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two witness records with the same node id.",
                "To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two witness records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "For each node id i, n stores the witness record with the most recent record time rti, the witness with most recent record time that is at least MIN RECORD GAP time units before rti, and so on until the record count limit (MAX RECORD COUNT) is reached.",
                "When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory.",
                "It decrements MAX RECORD COUNT and MAX HOP COUNT, and increments MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "It then first erases all witness records whose hop count exceeds the reduced MAX HOP COUNT value, and then erases witness records to satisfy the record gap criteria.",
                "Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its witness information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions.",
                "For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a <br>beacon</br> every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour.",
                "However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a <br>beacon</br> should be emitted every 10 seconds.",
                "If a user is not moving at all, a <br>beacon</br> can be emitted every 10 minutes.",
                "In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time.",
                "If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy.",
                "In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals.",
                "For example, suppose hiker A has communicated its witness information to three other hikers in the last five minutes.",
                "If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional witness information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to sleep mode if it is extremely low on power.",
                "The bandwidth and energy limitations of sensor nodes require that the amount of data transferred among the nodes be reduced to minimum.",
                "It has been observed that in some scenarios 3000 instructions could be executed for the same energy cost of sending a bit 100m by radio [15].",
                "To reduce the amount of data transfer, CenWits employs a handshake protocol that two nodes execute when they encounter one another.",
                "The goal of this protocol is to ensure that a node transmits only as much witness information as the other node is willing to receive.",
                "This protocol is initiated when a node i receives a <br>beacon</br> containing the node ID of the sender node j and i has not exchanged witness information with j in the last δ time units.",

                "Phase IV: After receiving the witness records from i, j sends its witness information (filtered based on receive constraints received in phase I). j <Constaints, Witness info size> <Constaints, Witness info size> <Filtered Witness info> <Filtered Witness info> i j j j i i i Figure 9: Four-Phase Hand Shake Protocol (i < j) Receive constraints are a function of memory and power.",
                "In the most general case, they are comprised of the three parameters (record count, hop count and record gap) used for memory management.",
                "If i is low on memory, it specifies the maximum number of records it is willing to accept from j.",
                "Similarly, i can ask j to send only those records that have hop count value less than MAX HOP COUNT − 1.",
                "Finally, i can include its MIN RECORD GAP value in its receive constraints.",
                "Note that the handshake protocol is beneficial to both i and j.",
                "They save memory by receiving only as much information as they are willing to accept and conserve energy by sending only as many witness records as needed.",
                "It turns out that filtering witness records based on MIN RECORD GAP is complex.",
                "It requires that the witness records of any given node be arranged in an order sorted by their record time values.",
                "Maintaining this sorted order is complex in memory, because new witness records with the same node id can arrive later that may have to be inserted in between to preserve the sorted order.",
                "For this reason, the receive constraints in the current CenWits prototype do not include record gap.",

                "If the hop count value is greater than 3, the record is not transmitted. 4.3 Groups and Partitions To further reduce communication and increase the lifetime of our system, we introduce the notion of groups.",

                "All other (shown in a lighter shade) are in sleep mode.",
                "As the group moves through the trail, it exchanges information with other nodes or groups that it comes across.",
                "At any point in time, only one group member, called the leader, sends and receives information on behalf of the group and all other n − 1 group members are put in the sleep mode (See Figure 10).",
                "It is this property of groups that saves us energy.",
                "The group leadership is time-multiplexed among the group members.",
                "This is done to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery due to continuous exchange of information.",
                "Thus after every t seconds, the leadership is passed on to another node, called the successor, and the leader (now an ordinary member) is put to sleep.",
                "Since energy is dear, we do not implement an extensive election algorithm for choosing the successor.",
                "Instead, we choose the successor on the basis of node id.",
                "The node with the next highest id in the group is chosen as the successor.",

                "A simpler scheme incurs lesser energy cost as compared to a more sophisticated scheme, but offers lesser memory savings as well.",
                "This is because in a more complicated scheme, the group members have to coordinate to update and store information.",
                "After considering a number of different schemes, we have come to a conclusion that there is no optimal storage scheme for groups.",
                "The system should be able to adapt according to its requirements.",
                "If group members are low on battery, then the group can adapt a scheme that is more energy efficient.",
                "Similarly, if the group members are running out of memory, they can adapt a scheme that is more memory efficient.",
                "We first present a simple scheme that is very energy efficient but does not offer significant memory savings.",
                "We then present an alternate scheme that is much more memory efficient.",
                "As already mentioned a group can receive information only through the group leader.",
                "Whenever the leader comes across an external node e, it receives information from that node and saves it.",
                "In our first scheme, when the timeslot for the leader expires, the leader passes this new information it received from e to its successor.",
                "This is important because during the next time slot, if the new leader comes across another external node, it should be able to pass information about all the external nodes this group has witnessed so far.",
                "Thus the information is fully replicated on all nodes to maintain the correct view of the world.",
                "Our first scheme does not offer any memory savings but is highly energy efficient and may be a good choice when the group members are running low on battery.",
                "Except for the time when the leadership is switched, all n − 1 members are asleep at any given time.",
                "This means that a single member is up for t seconds once every n∗t seconds and therefore has to spend approximately only 1/nth of its energy.",
                "Thus, if there are 5 members in a group, we save 80% energy, which is huge.",
                "More energy can be saved by increasing the group size.",
                "We now present an alternate data storage scheme that aims at saving memory at the cost of energy.",
                "In this scheme we divide the group into what we call partitions.",
                "Partitions can be thought of as subgroups within a group.",
                "Each partition must have at least two nodes in it.",
                "The nodes within a partition are called peers.",
                "Each partition has one peer designated as partition leader.",
                "The partition leader stays in receive mode at all times, while all others peers a partition stay in the sleep mode.",
                "Partition leadership is time-multiplexed among the peers to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery.",
                "Like before, a group has exactly one leader and the leadership is time-multiplexed among partitions.",
                "The group leader also serves as the partition leader for the partition it belongs to (See Figure 11).",
                "In this scheme, all partition leaders participate in information exchange.",
                "Whenever a group comes across an external node e, every partition leader receives all witness information, but it only stores a subset of that information after filtering.",
                "Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send witness information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to.",
                "However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode.",
                "Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their witness information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide.",
                "All this is achieved by having the group leader send a signal to every partition leader in turn. 186 Figure 11: The figure shows a group of eight nodes divided into four partitions of 2 nodes each.",
                "Node 1 is the group leader whereas nodes 2, 9, and 7 are partition leaders.",
                "All other nodes are in the sleep mode.",
                "Since the partition leadership is time-multiplexed, it is important that any information received by the partition leader, p1, be passed on to the next leader, p2.",
                "This has to be done to make sure that p2 has all the information that it might need to send when it comes across another external node during its timeslot.",
                "One way of achieving this is to wake p2 up just before p1s timeslot expires and then have p1 transfer information only to p2.",
                "An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers.",
                "Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep.",
                "In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information.",
                "In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes.",
                "In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers.",
                "Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one.",
                "A group can be divided into partitions in more than one way.",
                "For example, suppose we have a group of six members.",
                "We can divide this group into three partitions of two peers each, or two partitions with three peers each.",
                "The choice once again depends on the requirements of the system.",
                "A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient.",
                "This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time.",
                "On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12).",
                "A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery.",
                "This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node.",
                "For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node.",
                "Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all witness information stored in that partition will be lost.",
                "We have devised a very simple protocol to solve this problem.",

                "At this point, node 5 contacts other partition leaders (nodes 1 ... 9) using a broadcast message and informs them that one of its peers has died.",
                "Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of witness information stored in its partition.",
                "Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders.",
                "Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition.",
                "However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition.",

                "In this Section, we provide an estimate of how long the power of a MICA2 mote will last under certain assumtions.",
                "First, we assume that each sensor node carries about 100 witness records.",
                "On encountering another hiker, a sensor node transmits 50 witness records and receives 50 new witness records.",
                "Since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take 0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34 seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link.",
                "The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh.",
                "Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per hour.",
                "So, average power consumtion due to transmission and reception is (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 mA per hour.",
                "Given that the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500 mAh, a battery should last for 2500/15.75 = 159 hours of transmission and reception.",
                "An encounter between two hikers results in exchange of about 50 witness records that takes about 0.68 seconds as calculated above.",
                "Thus, a single alkaline battery can last for (159 ∗ 60 ∗ 60)/0.68 = 841764 hiker encounters.",
                "Assuming that a node emits a <br>beacon</br> every 90 seconds and a hiker encounter occurs everytime a <br>beacon</br> is emitted (worst-case scenario), a single alkaline battery will last for (841764 ∗ 90)/(30 ∗ 24 ∗ 60 ∗ 60) = 29 days.",
                "Since, a Mica2 is equipped with two batteries, a Mica2 sensor can remain operation for about two months.",
                "Notice that this calculation is preliminary, because it assumes that hikers are active 24 hours of the day and a hiker encounter occurs every 90 seconds.",
                "In a more realistic scenario, power is expected to last for a much longer time period.",
                "Also, this time period will significantly increase when groups of hikers are moving together.",
                "Finally, the lifetime of a sensor running on two batteries can definitely be increased significantly by using energy scavenging techniques and energy harvesting techniques [16, 14]. 6.",

                "But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain.",
                "Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries.",
                "These boundary sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff.",
                "Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs.",
                "If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier.",
                "If there is no witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.",
                "In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals.",
                "To collect data, either a satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver.",
                "GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2].",
                "Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds.",
                "Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it.",
                "Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of deers.",
                "CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces.",
                "CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case.",
                "Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data.",

                "They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.",
                "In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesnt work indoor and near skyscrapers.",
                "If a person A is reported missing, and from the witness records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 8.",
                "DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new search and rescue system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current search and rescue systems.",
                "These advantages include a looselycoupled system that relies only on intermittent network connectivity, power and storage efficiency, and low cost.",
                "It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
                "It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies.",
                "A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.",
                "In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.",
                "An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.",
                "This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.",
                "We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.",
                "While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system.",
                "We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present.",
                "Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.",
                "There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.",
                "For example, an adversary can sniff the witness information to locate endangered animals, females, children, etc.",
                "He may inject false information in the system.",
                "An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.",
                "In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.",
                "So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.",
                "However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.",
                "Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.",
                "In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.",
                "Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.",
                "So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.",
                "Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment.",

                "CenWits uses several small, commonly-available RF-based sensors, and a small number of storage and processing devices.",
                "It is designed for search and rescue of people in emergency situations in wilderness areas.",
                "A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected <br>sensor network</br> for its operation.",
                "It is designed for an intermittently connected network that provides only occasional connectivity.",
                "It makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "A prototype of CenWits has been implemented using Berkeley Mica2 motes.",
                "The paper describes this implementation and reports on the performance measured from it.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Computer-Communication Networks]: Distributed Systems General Terms Algorithms, Design, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Search and rescue of people in emergency situation in a timely manner is an extremely important service.",
                "It has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation.",
                "With the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones, sensors, etc.",
                "All these systems require a connected network via satellites, GSM base stations, or mobile devices.",
                "This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.",
                "For example, a GSM transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.",
                "As a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.",
                "While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.",
                "Furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g. in a car.",
                "An RF transmitter has a relatively smaller range of transmission.",
                "So, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide connectivity over a large wilderness area.",
                "In a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.",
                "In fact, building an adhoc <br>sensor network</br> using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.",
                "In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).",
                "CenWits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (AP) that collect information from these sensors, and GPS receivers and location points (LP) that provide location information to the sensors.",
                "A subject uses GPS receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and LPs to determine its current location.",
                "The key idea of CenWits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subjects movement and location information to the outside world.",
                "This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.",
                "In particular, there is no need for expensive GSM or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in CenWits. 180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.",
                "In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.",
                "The problem of low signal strengths (short range RF communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network.",
                "Instead, CenWits propagates the location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network.",
                "As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.",
                "Also, this makes CenWits cost-effective.",
                "A subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have GPS receivers but no expensive GSM or satellite transmitters.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no need for a connected <br>sensor network</br>, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.",
                "The problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions.",
                "Groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.",
                "Using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that information.",
                "In fact, CenWits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.",
                "Each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.",
                "It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.",
                "This paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by judiciously integrating the storage, communication and computation capabilities of sensors.",
                "The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.",
                "However, these techniques are quite general.",
                "We discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques.",
                "While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.",
                "First, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not require a connected network.",
                "Second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, CenWits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization.",
                "Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we overview some of the recent projects and technologies related to movement and location tracking, and search and rescue systems.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the overall architecture of CenWits, and provide a high-level description of its functionality.",
                "In the next section, Section 4, we discuss power and memory management in CenWits.",
                "To simplify our presentation, we will focus on a specific application of tracking lost/injured hikers in all these sections.",
                "In Section 6, we describe a prototype implementation of CenWits and present performance measured from this implementation.",
                "We discuss how the ideas of CenWits can be used to build several other applications in Section 7.",
                "Finally, in Section 8, we discuss some related issues and conclude the paper. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK A survey of location systems for ubiquitous computing is provided in [11].",
                "A location tracking system for adhoc sensor networks using anchor sensors as reference to gain location information and spread it out to outer node is proposed in [17].",
                "Most location tracking systems in adhoc sensor networks are for benefiting geographic-aware routing.",
                "They dont fit well for our purposes.",
                "The well-known active badge system [19] lets a user carry a badge around.",
                "An infrared sensor in the room can detect the presence of a badge and determine the location and identification of the person.",
                "This is a useful system for indoor environment, where GPS doesnt work.",
                "Locationing using 802.11 devices is probably the cheapest solution for indoor position tracking [8].",
                "Because of the popularity and low cost of 802.11 devices, several business solutions based on this technology have been developed[1].",
                "A system that combines two mature technologies and is viable in suburban area where a user can see clear sky and has GSM cellular reception at the same time is currently available[5].",
                "This system receives GPS signal from a satellite and locates itself, draws location on a map, and sends location information through GSM network to the others who are interested in the users location.",
                "A very simple system to monitor children consists an RF transmitter and a receiver.",
                "The system alarms the holder of the receiver when the transmitter is about to run out of range [6].",

                "A skier carries an RF transmitter that emits beacons periodically, so that a rescue team can find his/her location based on the strength of the RF signal.",
                "Luxury version of PLB combines a GPS receiver and a COSPASSARSAT satellite transmitter that can transmit users location in latitude and longitude to the rescue team whenever an accident happens [4].",
                "However, the device either is turned on all the time resulting in fast battery drain, or must be turned on after the accident to function.",
                "Another related technology in widespread use today is the ONSTAR system [3], typically used in several luxury cars.",
                "In this system, a GPS unit provides position information, and a powerful transmitter relays that information via satellite to a customer service center.",
                "Designed for emergencies, the system can be triggered either by the user with the push of a button, or by a catastrophic accident.",
                "Once the system has been triggered, a human representative attempts to gain communication with the user via a cell phone built as an incar device.",
                "If contact cannot be made, emergency services are dispatched to the location provided by GPS.",
                "Like PLBs, this system has several limitations.",
                "First, it is heavy and expensive.",
                "It requires a satellite transmitter and a connected network.",
                "If connectivity with either the GPS network or a communication satellite cannot be maintained, the system fails.",
                "Unfortunately, these are common obstacles encountered in deep canyons, narrow streets in large cities, parking garages, and a number of other places. 181 The Lifetch system uses GPS receiver board combined with a GSM/GPRS transmitter and an RF transmitter in one wireless sensor node called Intelligent Communication Unit (ICU).",
                "An ICU first attempts to transmit its location to a control center through GSM/GPRS network.",
                "If that fails, it connects with other ICUs (adhoc network) to forward its location information until the information reaches an ICU that has GSM/GPRS reception.",
                "This ICU then transmits the location information of the original ICU via the GSM/GPRS network.",
                "ZebraNet is a system designed to study the moving patterns of zebras [13].",
                "It utilizes two protocols: History-based protocol and flooding protocol.",
                "History-based protocol is used when the zebras are grazing and not moving around too much.",
                "While this might be useful for tracking zebras, its not suitable for tracking hikers because two hikers are most likely to meet each other only once on a trail.",
                "In the flooding protocol, a node dumps its data to a neighbor whenever it finds one and doesnt delete its own copy until it finds a base station.",
                "Without considering routing loops, packet filtering and grouping, the size of data on a node will grow exponentially and drain the power and memory of a sensor node with in a short time.",
                "Instead, Cenwits uses a four-phase hand-shake protocol to ensure that a node transmits only as much information as the other node is willing to receive.",
                "While ZebraNet is designed for a big group of sensors moving together in the same direction with same speed, Cenwits is designed to be used in the scenario where sensors move in different directions at different speeds.",
                "Delay tolerant network architecture addresses some important problems in challenged (resource-constrained) networks [9].",
                "While this work is mainly concerned with interoperability of challenged networks, some problems related to occasionally-connected networks are similar to the ones we have addressed in CenWits.",
                "Among all these systems, luxury PLB and Lifetch are designed for location tracking in wilderness areas.",
                "However, both of these systems require a connected network.",
                "Luxury PLB requires the user to transmit a signal to a satellite, while Lifetch requires connection to GSM/GPRS network.",
                "Luxury PLB transmits location information, only when an accident happens.",
                "However, if the user is buried in the snow or falls into a deep canyon, there is almost no chance for the signal to go through and be relayed to the rescue team.",
                "This is because satellite transmission needs line of sight.",
                "Furthermore, since there is no known history of users location, it is not possible for the rescue team to infer the current location of the user.",
                "Another disadvantage of luxury PLB is that a satellite transmitter is very expensive, costing in the range of $750.",
                "Lifetch attempts to transmit the location information by GSM/GPRS and adhoc <br>sensor network</br> that uses AODV as the routing protocol.",
                "However, having a cellular reception in remote areas in wilderness areas, e.g.",
                "American national parks is unlikely.",
                "Furthermore, it is extremely unlikely that ICUs worn by hikers will be able to form an adhoc network in a large wilderness area.",
                "This is because the hikers are mobile and it is very unlikely to have several ICUs placed dense enough to forward packets even on a very popular hike route.",
                "CenWits is designed to address the limitations of systems such as luxury PLB and Lifetch.",
                "It is designed to provide hikers, skiers, and climbers who have their activities mainly in wilderness areas a much higher chance to convey their location information to a control center.",
                "It is not reliant upon constant connectivity with any communication medium.",
                "Rather, it communicates information along from user to user, finally arriving at a control center.",
                "Unlike several of the systems discussed so far, it does not require that a users unit is constantly turned on.",
                "In fact, it can discover a victims location, even if the victims sensor was off at the time of accident and has remained off since then.",
                "CenWits solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.",
                "This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.",
                "Figure 1: Hiker A and Hiker B are are not in the range of each other 3.",
                "CENWITS We describe CenWits in the context of locating lost/injured hikers in wilderness areas.",
                "Each hiker wears a sensor (MICA2 motes in our prototype) equipped with a GPS receiver and an RF transmitter.",
                "Each sensor is assigned a unique ID and maintains its current location based on the signal received by its GPS receiver.",
                "It also emits beacons periodically.",
                "When any two sensors are in the range of one another, they record the presence of each other (witness information), and also exchange the witness information they recorded earlier.",
                "The key idea here is that if two sensors come with in range of each other at any time, they become each others witnesses.",
                "Later on, if the hiker wearing one of these sensors is lost, the other sensor can convey the last known (witnessed) location of the lost hiker.",
                "Furthermore, by exchanging the witness information that each sensor recorded earlier, the witness information is propagated beyond a direct contact between two sensors.",
                "To convey witness information to a processing center or to a rescue team, access points are established at well-known locations that the hikers are expected to pass through, e.g. at the trail heads, trail ends, intersection of different trails, scenic view points, resting areas, and so on.",
                "Whenever a sensor node is in the vicinity of an access point, all witness information stored in that sensor is automatically dumped to the access point.",
                "Access points are connected to a processing center via satellite or some other network1 .",
                "The witness information is downloaded to the processing center from various access points at regular intervals.",
                "In case, connection to an access point is lost, the information from that 1 A connection is needed only between access points and a processing center.",
                "There is no need for any connection between different access points. 182 access point can be downloaded manually, e.g. by UAVs.",
                "To estimate the speed, location and direction of a hiker at any point in time, all witness information of that hiker that has been collected from various access points is processed.",
                "Figure 2: Hiker A and Hiker B are in the range of each other.",
                "A records the presence of B and B records the presence of A.",
                "A and B become each others witnesses.",
                "Figure 3: Hiker A is in the range of an access point.",
                "It uploads its recorded witness information and clears its memory.",
                "An example of how CenWits operates is illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3.",
                "First, hikers A and B are on two close trails, but out of range of each other (Figure 1).",
                "This is a very common scenario during a hike.",
                "For example, on a popular four-hour hike, a hiker might run into as many as 20 other hikers.",
                "This accounts for one encounter every 12 minutes on average.",
                "A slow hiker can go 1 mile (5,280 feet) per hour.",
                "Thus in 12 minutes a slow hiker can go as far as 1056 feet.",
                "This implies that if we were to put 20 hikers on a 4-hour, one-way hike evenly, the range of each sensor node should be at least 1056 feet for them to communicate with one another continuously.",
                "The signal strength starts dropping rapidly for two Mica2 nodes to communicate with each other when they are 180 feet away, and is completely lost when they are 230 feet away from each other[7].",
                "So, for the sensors to form a <br>sensor network</br> on a 4-hour hiking trail, there should be at least 120 hikers scattered evenly.",
                "Clearly, this is extremely unlikely.",
                "In fact, in a 4-hour, less-popular hiking trail, one might only run into say five other hikers.",
                "CenWits takes advantage of the fact that sensors can communicate with one another and record their presence.",
                "Given a walking speed of one mile per hour (88 feet per minute) and Mica2 range of about 150 feet for non-line-of-sight radio transmission, two hikers have about 150/88 = 1.7 minutes to discover the presence of each other and exchange their witness information.",
                "We therefore design our system to have each sensor emit a beacon every one-and-a-half minute.",
                "In Figure 2, hiker Bs sensor emits a beacon when A is in range, this triggers A to exchange data with B.",
                "A communicates the following information to B: My ID is A; I saw C at 1:23 PM at (39◦ 49.3277655, 105◦ 39.1126776), I saw E at 3:09 PM at (40◦ 49.2234879, 105◦ 20.3290168).",

                "In our current prototype, we have allocated one byte for Node Id, although this can be increased to two or more bytes if a large number of hikers are expected to be present at the same time.",
                "We can represent time in 17 bits to a second precision.",
                "So, we have allocated 3 bytes each for Record Time and Location Time.",
                "The circumference of the Earth is approximately 40,075 KM.",
                "If we use a 32-bit number to represent both longitude and latitude, the precision we get is 40,075,000/232 = 0.0093 meter = 0.37 inches, which is quite precise for our needs.",
                "So, we have allocated 4 bytes each for X and Y coordinates of the location of a node.",
                "In fact, a foot precision can be achieved by using only 27 bits. 3.2 Location Point and Location Inference Although a GPS receiver provides an accurate location information, it has its limitation.",
                "In canyons and rainy forests, a GPS receiver does not work.",
                "When there is a heavy cloud cover, GPS users have experienced inaccuracy in the reported location as well.",
                "Unfortunately, a lot of hiking trails are in dense forests and canyons, and its not that uncommon to rain after hikers start hiking.",
                "To address this, CenWits incorporates the idea of location points (LP).",
                "A location point can update a sensor node with its current location whenever the node is near that LP.",
                "LPs are placed at different locations in a wilderness area where GPS receivers dont work.",
                "An LP is a very simple device that emits prerecorded location information at some regular time interval.",
                "It can be placed in difficult-to-reach places such as deep canyons and dense rain forests by simply dropping them from an airplane.",
                "LPs allow a sensor node to determine its current location more accurately.",
                "However, they are not 183 an essential requirement of CenWits.",
                "If an LP runs out of power, the CenWits will continue to work correctly.",
                "Figure 5: GPS receiver not working correctly.",
                "Sensors then have to rely on LP to provide coordination In Figure 5, B cannot get GPS reception due to bad weather.",
                "It then runs into A on the trail who doesnt have GPS reception either.",
                "Their sensors record the presence of each other.",
                "After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A.",
                "When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter location of A and B.",
                "By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be inferred.",
                "Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).",
                "Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.",
                "CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.",
                "Such a synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available.",
                "In addition, sensor nodes in CenWits synchronize their clocks whenever they are in the range of an AP or an LP.",
                "The Figure 8: Based on overlapping landscape, B might have hiked to wrong branch and fallen off a cliff.",
                "Hot rescue areas can thus be determined synchronization accuracy Cenwits needs is of the order of a second or so.",
                "As long as the clocks are synchronized with in one second range, whether A met B at 12:3745 or 12:3746 doesnt matter in the ordering of witness events and inferring the path. 4.",
                "MEMORY AND POWER MANAGEMENT CenWits employs several important mechanisms to conserve power and memory.",
                "It is important to note while current sensor nodes have limited amount of memory, future sensor nodes are expected to have much more memory.",
                "With this in mind, the main focus in our design is to provide a tradeoff between the amount of memory available and amount of power consumption. 4.1 Memory Management The size of witness information stored at a node can get very large.",
                "This is because the node may come across several other nodes during a hike, and may end up accumulating a large amount of witness information over time.",
                "To address this problem, CenWits allows a node to pro-actively free up some parts of its memory periodically.",
                "This raises an interesting question of when and which witness record should be deleted from the memory of a node?",
                "CenWits uses three criteria to determine this: record count, hop count, and record gap.",
                "Record count refers to the number of witness records with same node id that a node has stored in its memory.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter MAX RECORD COUNT.",
                "It stores at most MAX RECORD COUNT witness records of any node.",
                "Every witness record has a hop count field that stores the number times (hops) this record has been transferred since being created.",
                "Initially this field is set to 0.",
                "Whenever a node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.",
                "A node maintains an integer parameter called MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.",
                "The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.",
                "We chose to use hop count instead of time-to-live to decide when to drop a packet.",
                "The main reason for this is that the probability of a packet reaching an AP goes up as the hop count adds up.",
                "For example, when the hop count if 5 for a specific record, 184 the record is in at least 5 sensor nodes.",
                "On the other hand, if we discard old records, without considering hop count, there is no guarantee that the record is present in any other sensor node.",
                "Record gap refers to the time difference between the record times of two witness records with the same node id.",
                "To save memory, a node n ensures the the record gap between any two witness records with the same node id is at least MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "For each node id i, n stores the witness record with the most recent record time rti, the witness with most recent record time that is at least MIN RECORD GAP time units before rti, and so on until the record count limit (MAX RECORD COUNT) is reached.",
                "When a node is tight in memory, it adjusts the three parameters, MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to free up some memory.",
                "It decrements MAX RECORD COUNT and MAX HOP COUNT, and increments MIN RECORD GAP.",
                "It then first erases all witness records whose hop count exceeds the reduced MAX HOP COUNT value, and then erases witness records to satisfy the record gap criteria.",
                "Also, when a node has extra memory space available, e.g. after dumping its witness information at an access point, it resets MAX RECORD COUNT, MAX HOP COUNT and MIN RECORD GAP to some predefined values. 4.2 Power Management An important advantage of using sensors for tracking purposes is that we can regulate the behavior of a sensor node based on current conditions.",
                "For example, we mentioned earlier that a sensor should emit a beacon every 1.7 minute, given a hiking speed of 1 mile/hour.",
                "However, if a user is moving 10 feet/sec, a beacon should be emitted every 10 seconds.",
                "If a user is not moving at all, a beacon can be emitted every 10 minutes.",
                "In the night, a sensor can be put into sleep mode to save energy, when a user is not likely to move at all for a relatively longer period of time.",
                "If a user is active for only eight hours in a day, we can put the sensor into sleep mode for the other 16 hours and thus save 2/3rd of the energy.",
                "In addition, a sensor node can choose to not send any beacons during some time intervals.",
                "For example, suppose hiker A has communicated its witness information to three other hikers in the last five minutes.",
                "If it is running low on power, it can go to receive mode or sleep mode for the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to receive mode if it is still willing to receive additional witness information from hikers that it encounters in the next ten minutes.",
                "It goes to sleep mode if it is extremely low on power.",
                "The bandwidth and energy limitations of sensor nodes require that the amount of data transferred among the nodes be reduced to minimum.",
                "It has been observed that in some scenarios 3000 instructions could be executed for the same energy cost of sending a bit 100m by radio [15].",
                "To reduce the amount of data transfer, CenWits employs a handshake protocol that two nodes execute when they encounter one another.",
                "The goal of this protocol is to ensure that a node transmits only as much witness information as the other node is willing to receive.",
                "This protocol is initiated when a node i receives a beacon containing the node ID of the sender node j and i has not exchanged witness information with j in the last δ time units.",
                "Assume that i < j.",
                "The protocol consists of four phases (See Figure 9): 1.",
                "Phase I: Node i sends its receive constraints and the number of witness records it has in its memory. 2.",
                "Phase II: On receiving this message from i, j sends its receive constraints and the number of witness records it has in its memory. 3.",
                "Phase III: On receiving the above message from j, i sends its witness information (filtered based on receive constraints received in phase II). 4.",
                "Phase IV: After receiving the witness records from i, j sends its witness information (filtered based on receive constraints received in phase I). j <Constaints, Witness info size> <Constaints, Witness info size> <Filtered Witness info> <Filtered Witness info> i j j j i i i Figure 9: Four-Phase Hand Shake Protocol (i < j) Receive constraints are a function of memory and power.",
                "In the most general case, they are comprised of the three parameters (record count, hop count and record gap) used for memory management.",
                "If i is low on memory, it specifies the maximum number of records it is willing to accept from j.",
                "Similarly, i can ask j to send only those records that have hop count value less than MAX HOP COUNT − 1.",
                "Finally, i can include its MIN RECORD GAP value in its receive constraints.",
                "Note that the handshake protocol is beneficial to both i and j.",
                "They save memory by receiving only as much information as they are willing to accept and conserve energy by sending only as many witness records as needed.",
                "It turns out that filtering witness records based on MIN RECORD GAP is complex.",
                "It requires that the witness records of any given node be arranged in an order sorted by their record time values.",
                "Maintaining this sorted order is complex in memory, because new witness records with the same node id can arrive later that may have to be inserted in between to preserve the sorted order.",
                "For this reason, the receive constraints in the current CenWits prototype do not include record gap.",
                "Suppose i specifies a hop count value of 3.",
                "In this case, j checks the hop count field of every witness record before sending them.",
                "If the hop count value is greater than 3, the record is not transmitted. 4.3 Groups and Partitions To further reduce communication and increase the lifetime of our system, we introduce the notion of groups.",
                "The idea is based on the concept of abstract regions presented in [20].",
                "A group is a set of n nodes that can be defined in terms of radio connectivity, geographic location, or other properties of nodes.",
                "All nodes within a group can communicate directly with one another and they share information to maintain their view of the external world.",
                "At any point in time, a group has exactly one leader that communicates 185 with external nodes on behalf of the entire group.",
                "A group can be static, meaning that the group membership does not change over the period of time, or it could be dynamic in which case nodes can leave or join the group.",
                "To make our analysis simple and to explain the advantages of group, we first discuss static groups.",
                "A static group is formed at the start of a hiking trail or ski slope.",
                "Suppose there are five family members who want to go for a hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park.",
                "Before these members start their hike, each one of them is given a sensor node and the information is entered in the system that the five nodes form a group.",
                "Each group member is given a unique id and every group member knows about other members of the group.",
                "The group, as a whole, is also assigned an id to distinguish it from other groups in the system.",
                "Figure 10: A group of five people.",
                "Node 2 is the group leader and it is communicating on behalf of the group with an external node 17.",
                "All other (shown in a lighter shade) are in sleep mode.",
                "As the group moves through the trail, it exchanges information with other nodes or groups that it comes across.",
                "At any point in time, only one group member, called the leader, sends and receives information on behalf of the group and all other n − 1 group members are put in the sleep mode (See Figure 10).",
                "It is this property of groups that saves us energy.",
                "The group leadership is time-multiplexed among the group members.",
                "This is done to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery due to continuous exchange of information.",
                "Thus after every t seconds, the leadership is passed on to another node, called the successor, and the leader (now an ordinary member) is put to sleep.",
                "Since energy is dear, we do not implement an extensive election algorithm for choosing the successor.",
                "Instead, we choose the successor on the basis of node id.",
                "The node with the next highest id in the group is chosen as the successor.",
                "The last node, of course, chooses the node with the lowest id as its successor.",
                "We now discuss the data storage schemes for groups.",
                "Memory is a scarce resource in sensor nodes and it is therefore important that witness information be stored efficiently among group members.",
                "Efficient data storage is not a trivial task when it comes to groups.",
                "The tradeoff is between simplicity of the scheme and memory savings.",
                "A simpler scheme incurs lesser energy cost as compared to a more sophisticated scheme, but offers lesser memory savings as well.",
                "This is because in a more complicated scheme, the group members have to coordinate to update and store information.",
                "After considering a number of different schemes, we have come to a conclusion that there is no optimal storage scheme for groups.",
                "The system should be able to adapt according to its requirements.",
                "If group members are low on battery, then the group can adapt a scheme that is more energy efficient.",
                "Similarly, if the group members are running out of memory, they can adapt a scheme that is more memory efficient.",
                "We first present a simple scheme that is very energy efficient but does not offer significant memory savings.",
                "We then present an alternate scheme that is much more memory efficient.",
                "As already mentioned a group can receive information only through the group leader.",
                "Whenever the leader comes across an external node e, it receives information from that node and saves it.",
                "In our first scheme, when the timeslot for the leader expires, the leader passes this new information it received from e to its successor.",
                "This is important because during the next time slot, if the new leader comes across another external node, it should be able to pass information about all the external nodes this group has witnessed so far.",
                "Thus the information is fully replicated on all nodes to maintain the correct view of the world.",
                "Our first scheme does not offer any memory savings but is highly energy efficient and may be a good choice when the group members are running low on battery.",
                "Except for the time when the leadership is switched, all n − 1 members are asleep at any given time.",
                "This means that a single member is up for t seconds once every n∗t seconds and therefore has to spend approximately only 1/nth of its energy.",
                "Thus, if there are 5 members in a group, we save 80% energy, which is huge.",
                "More energy can be saved by increasing the group size.",
                "We now present an alternate data storage scheme that aims at saving memory at the cost of energy.",
                "In this scheme we divide the group into what we call partitions.",
                "Partitions can be thought of as subgroups within a group.",
                "Each partition must have at least two nodes in it.",
                "The nodes within a partition are called peers.",
                "Each partition has one peer designated as partition leader.",
                "The partition leader stays in receive mode at all times, while all others peers a partition stay in the sleep mode.",
                "Partition leadership is time-multiplexed among the peers to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery.",
                "Like before, a group has exactly one leader and the leadership is time-multiplexed among partitions.",
                "The group leader also serves as the partition leader for the partition it belongs to (See Figure 11).",
                "In this scheme, all partition leaders participate in information exchange.",
                "Whenever a group comes across an external node e, every partition leader receives all witness information, but it only stores a subset of that information after filtering.",
                "Information is filtered in such a way that each partition leader has to store only B/K bytes of data, where K is the number of partitions and B is the total number of bytes received from e. Similarly when a group wants to send witness information to e, each partition leader sends only B/K bytes that are stored in the partition it belongs to.",
                "However, before a partition leader can send information, it must switch from receive mode to send mode.",
                "Also, partition leaders must coordinate with one another to ensure that they do not send their witness information at the same time, i.e. their message do not collide.",
                "All this is achieved by having the group leader send a signal to every partition leader in turn. 186 Figure 11: The figure shows a group of eight nodes divided into four partitions of 2 nodes each.",
                "Node 1 is the group leader whereas nodes 2, 9, and 7 are partition leaders.",
                "All other nodes are in the sleep mode.",
                "Since the partition leadership is time-multiplexed, it is important that any information received by the partition leader, p1, be passed on to the next leader, p2.",
                "This has to be done to make sure that p2 has all the information that it might need to send when it comes across another external node during its timeslot.",
                "One way of achieving this is to wake p2 up just before p1s timeslot expires and then have p1 transfer information only to p2.",
                "An alternate is to wake all the peers up at the time of leadership change, and then have p1 broadcast the information to all peers.",
                "Each peer saves the information sent by p1 and then goes back to sleep.",
                "In both cases, the peers send acknowledgement to the partition leader after receiving the information.",
                "In the former method, only one node needs to wake up at the time of leadership change, but the amount of information that has to be transmitted between the nodes increases as time passes.",
                "In the latter case, all nodes have to be woken up at the time of leadership change, but small piece of information has to be transmitted each time among the peers.",
                "Since communication is much more expensive than bringing the nodes up, we prefer the second method over the first one.",
                "A group can be divided into partitions in more than one way.",
                "For example, suppose we have a group of six members.",
                "We can divide this group into three partitions of two peers each, or two partitions with three peers each.",
                "The choice once again depends on the requirements of the system.",
                "A few big partitions will make the system more energy efficient.",
                "This is because in this configuration, a greater number of nodes will stay in sleep mode at any given point in time.",
                "On the other hand, several small partitions will make the system memory efficient, since each node will have to store lesser information (See Figure 12).",
                "A group that is divided into partitions must be able to readjust itself when a node leaves or runs out of battery.",
                "This is crucial because a partition must have at least two nodes at any point in time to tolerate failure of one node.",
                "For example, in figure 3 (a), if node 2 or node 5 dies, the partition is left with only one node.",
                "Later on, if that single node in the partition dies, all witness information stored in that partition will be lost.",
                "We have devised a very simple protocol to solve this problem.",
                "We first explain how partiFigure 12: The figure shows two different ways of partitioning a group of six nodes.",
                "In (a), a group is divided into three partitions of two nodes.",
                "Node 1 is the group leader, nodes 9 and 5 are partition leaders, and nodes 2, 3, and 6 are in sleep mode.",
                "In (b) the group is divided into two partitions of three nodes.",
                "Node 1 is the group leader, node 9 is the partition leader and nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6 are in sleep mode. tions are adjusted when a peer dies, and then explain what happens if a partition leader dies.",
                "Suppose node 2 in figure 3 (a) dies.",
                "When node 5, the partition leader, sends information to node 2, it does not receive an acknowledgement from it and concludes that node 2 has died2 .",

                "Upon hearing this, each partition leader informs node 5 (i) the number of nodes in its partition, (ii) a candidate node that node 5 can take if the number of nodes in its partition is greater than 2, and (iii) the amount of witness information stored in its partition.",
                "Upon hearing from every leader, node 5 chooses the candidate node from the partition with maximum number (must be greater than 2) of peers, and sends a message back to all leaders.",
                "Node 5 then sends data to its new peer to make sure that the information is replicated within the partition.",
                "However, if all partitions have exactly two nodes, then node 5 must join another partition.",

                "SYSTEM EVALUATION A sensor is constrained in the amount of memory and power.",
                "In general, the amount of memory needed and power consumption depends on a variety of factors such as node density, number of hiker encounters, and the number of access points.",
                "In this Section, we provide an estimate of how long the power of a MICA2 mote will last under certain assumtions.",
                "First, we assume that each sensor node carries about 100 witness records.",

                "Since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take 0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34 seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link.",
                "The power consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and 8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mAh.",
                "Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per hour.",
                "So, average power consumtion due to transmission and reception is (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 mA per hour.",
                "Given that the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500 mAh, a battery should last for 2500/15.75 = 159 hours of transmission and reception.",
                "An encounter between two hikers results in exchange of about 50 witness records that takes about 0.68 seconds as calculated above.",
                "Thus, a single alkaline battery can last for (159 ∗ 60 ∗ 60)/0.68 = 841764 hiker encounters.",
                "Assuming that a node emits a beacon every 90 seconds and a hiker encounter occurs everytime a beacon is emitted (worst-case scenario), a single alkaline battery will last for (841764 ∗ 90)/(30 ∗ 24 ∗ 60 ∗ 60) = 29 days.",
                "Since, a Mica2 is equipped with two batteries, a Mica2 sensor can remain operation for about two months.",
                "Notice that this calculation is preliminary, because it assumes that hikers are active 24 hours of the day and a hiker encounter occurs every 90 seconds.",
                "In a more realistic scenario, power is expected to last for a much longer time period.",
                "Also, this time period will significantly increase when groups of hikers are moving together.",

                "It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies.",
                "A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.",
                "In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.",
                "An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.",
                "This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.",
                "We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.",
                "While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative, systemlevel ideas for information processing in a <br>sensor network</br> system.",
                "We have developed and experimented with a basic prototype of CenWits at present.",
                "Future work includes developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.",
                "There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.",

                "An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.",
                "In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.",
                "So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.",
                "However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.",
                "Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.",
                "In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.",
                "Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.",
                "So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.",
