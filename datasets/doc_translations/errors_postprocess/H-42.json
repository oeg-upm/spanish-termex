We define two normalized versions of average precision, that we use to construct a weighted bipartite graph of TREC systems and topics. We analyze the meaning of well known - and somewhat generalized - indicators from social network analysis on the Systems-Topics graph. We apply this method to an analysis of TREC 8 data; among the results, we find that authority measures systems performance, that hubness of topics reveals that some topics are better than others at distinguishing more or less effective systems, that with current measures a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics, and that by using different effectiveness measures this is no longer the case. Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval General Terms Measurement, Experimentation 1. INTRODUCTION Evaluation is a primary concern in the Information Retrieval (IR) field. TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) [12, 15] is an annual benchmarking exercise that has become a de facto standard in IR evaluation: before the actual conference, TREC provides to participants a collection of documents and a set of topics (representations of information needs). Participants use their systems to retrieve, and submit to TREC, a list of documents for each topic. After the lists have been submitted and pooled, the TREC organizers employ human assessors to provide relevance judgements on the pooled set. This defines a set of relevant documents for each topic. System effectiveness is then measured by well established metrics (Mean Average Precision being the most used). Other conferences such as NTCIR, INEX, CLEF provide comparable data. Network analysis is a discipline that studies features and properties of (usually large) networks, or graphs. Of particular importance is Social Network Analysis [16], that studies networks made up by links among humans (friendship, acquaintance, co-authorship, bibliographic citation, etc.). Network analysis and IR fruitfully meet in Web Search Engine implementation, as is already described in textbooks [3,6]. Current search engines use link analysis techniques to help rank the retrieved documents. Some indicators (and the corresponding algorithms that compute them) have been found useful in this respect, and are nowadays well known: Inlinks (the number of links to a Web page), PageRank [7], and HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) [5]. Several extensions to these algorithms have been and are being proposed. These indicators and algorithms might be quite general in nature, and can be used for applications which are very different from search result ranking. One example is using HITS for stemming, as described by Agosti et al. [1]. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a method for constructing a network, specifically a weighted complete bidirectional directed bipartite graph, on a set of TREC topics and participating systems. Links represent effectiveness measurements on system-topic pairs. We then apply analysis methods originally developed for search applications to the resulting network. This reveals phenomena previously hidden in TREC data. In passing, we also provide a small generalization to Kleinbergs HITS algorithm, as well as to Inlinks and PageRank. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 gives some motivations for the work. Sect. 3 presents the basic ideas of normalizing average precision and of constructing a systemstopics graph, whose properties are analyzed in Sect. 4; Sect. 5 presents some experiments on TREC 8 data; Sect. 6 discusses some issues and Sect. 7 closes the paper. 2. MOTIVATIONS We are interested in the following hypotheses: 1. Some systems are more effective than others; t1 · · · tn MAP s1 AP(s1, t1) · · · AP(s1, tn) MAP(s1) ... ... ... sm AP(sm, t1) · · · AP(sm, tn) MAP(sm) AAP AAP(t1) · · · AAP(tn) (a) t1 t2 · · · MAP s1 0.5 0.4 · · · 0.6 s2 0.4 · · · · · · 0.3 ... ... ... ... AAP 0.6 0.3 · · · (b) Table 1: AP, MAP and AAP 2. Some topics are easier than others; 3. Some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; 4. Some topics are better than others at distinguishing more or less effective systems. The first of these hypotheses needs no further justification - every reported significant difference between any two systems supports it. There is now also quite a lot of evidence for the second, centered on the TREC Robust Track [14]. Our primary interest is in the third and fourth. The third might be regarded as being of purely academic interest; however, the fourth has the potential for being of major practical importance in evaluation studies. If we could identify a relatively small number of topics which were really good at distinguishing effective and ineffective systems, we could save considerable effort in evaluating systems. One possible direction from this point would be to attempt direct identification of such small sets of topics. However, in the present paper, we seek instead to explore the relationships suggested by the hypotheses, between what different topics tell us about systems and what different systems tell us about topics. We seek methods of building and analysing a matrix of system-topic normalised performances, with a view to giving insight into the issue and confirming or refuting the third and fourth hypotheses. It turns out that the obvious symmetry implied by the above formulation of the hypotheses is a property worth investigating, and the investigation does indeed give us valuable insights. 3. THE IDEA 3.1 1st step: average precision table From TREC results, one can produce an Average Precision (AP) table (see Tab. 1a): each AP(si, tj) value measures the AP of system si on topic tj. Besides AP values, the table shows Mean Average Precision (MAP) values i.e., the mean of the AP values for a single system over all topics, and what we call Average Average Precision (AAP) values i.e., the average of the AP values for a single topic over all systems: MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 AP(si, tj), (1) AAP(tj) = 1 m mX i=1 AP(si, tj). (2) MAPs are indicators of systems performance: higher MAP means good system. AAP are indicators of the performance on a topic: higher AAP means easy topic - a topic on which all or most systems have good performance. 3.2 Critique of pure AP MAP is a standard, well known, and widely used IR effectiveness measure. Single AP values are used too (e.g., in AP histograms). Topic difficulty is often discussed (e.g., in TREC Robust track [14]), although AAP values are not used and, to the best of our knowledge, have never been proposed (the median, not the average, of AP on a topic is used to produce TREC AP histograms [11]). However, the AP values in Tab. 1 present two limitations, which are symmetric in some respect: • Problem 1. They are not reliable to compare the effectiveness of a system on different topics, relative to the other systems. If, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s1, t2), can we infer that s1 is a good system (i.e., has a good performance) on t1 and a bad system on t2? The answer is no: t1 might be an easy topic (with high AAP) and t2 a difficult one (low AAP). See an example in Tab. 1b: s1 is outperformed (on average) by the other systems on t1, and it outperforms the other systems on t2. • Problem 2. Conversely, if, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s2, t1), can we infer that t1 is considered easier by s1 than by s2? No, we cannot: s1 might be a good system (with high MAP) and s2 a bad one (low MAP); see an example in Tab. 1b. These two problems are a sort of breakdown of the well known high influence of topics on IR evaluation; again, our formulation makes explicit the topics / systems symmetry. 3.3 2nd step: normalizations To avoid these two problems, we can normalize the AP table in two ways. The first normalization removes the influence of the single topic ease on system performance. Each AP(si, tj) value in the table depends on both system goodness and topic ease (the value will increase if a system is good and/or the topic is easy). By subtracting from each AP(si, tj) the AAP(tj) value, we obtain normalized AP values (APA(si, tj), Normalized AP according to AAP): APA(si, tj) = AP(si, tj) − AAP(tj), (3) that depend on system performance only (the value will increase only if system performance is good). See Tab. 2a. The second normalization removes the influence of the single system effectiveness on topic ease: by subtracting from each AP(si, tj) the MAP(si) value, we obtain normalized AP values (APM(si, tj), Normalized AP according to MAP): APM(si, tj) = AP(si, tj) − MAP(si), (4) that depend on topic ease only (the value will increase only if the topic is easy, i.e., all systems perform well on that topic). See Tab. 2b. In other words, APA avoids Problem 1: APA(s, t) values measure the performance of system s on topic t normalized t1 · · · tn MAP s1 APA(s1, t1) · · · APA(s1, tn) MAP(s1) ... ... ... sm APA(sm, t1) · · · APA(sm, tn) MAP(sm) 0 · · · 0 0 (a) t1 · · · tn s1 APM(s1, t1) · · · APM(s1, tn) 0 ... ... ... sm APM(sm, t1) · · · APM(sm, tn) 0 AAP AAP(t1) · · · AAP(tn) 0 (b) t1 t2 · · · MAP s1 −0.1 0.1 · · · . . . s2 0.2 · · · · · · . . . ... ... ... 0 0 · · · t1 t2 · · · s1 −0.1 −0.2 · · · 0 s2 0.1 · · · · · · 0 ... ... ... AAP . . . . . . · · · (c) (d) Table 2: Normalizations: APA and MAP: normalized AP (APA) and MAP (MAP) (a); normalized AP (APM) and AAP (AAP) (b); a numeric example (c) and (d) according to the ease of the topic (easy topics will not have higher APA values). Now, if, for example, APA(s1, t2) > APA(s1, t1), we can infer that s1 is a good system on t2 and a bad system on t1 (see Tab. 2c). Vice versa, APM avoids Problem 2: APM(s, t) values measure the ease of topic t according to system s, normalized according to goodness of the system (good systems will not lead to higher APM values). If, for example, APM(s2, t1) > APM(s1, t1), we can infer that t1 is considered easier by s2 than by s1 (see Tab. 2d). On the basis of Tables 2a and 2b, we can also define two new measures of system effectiveness and topic ease, i.e., a Normalized MAP (MAP), obtained by averaging the APA values on one row in Tab. 2a, and a Normalized AAP (AAP), obtained by averaging the APM values on one column in Tab. 2b: MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 APA(si, tj) (5) AAP(tj) = 1 m mX i=1 APM(si, tj). (6) Thus, overall system performance can be measured, besides by means of MAP, also by means of MAP. Moreover, MAP is equivalent to MAP, as can be immediately proved by using Eqs. (5), (3), and (1): MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 (AP(si, tj) − AAP(tj)) = = MAP(si) − 1 n nX j=1 AAP(tj) (and 1 n Pn j=1 AAP(tj) is the same for all systems). And, conversely, overall topic ease can be measured, besides by t1 · · · tn s1 ... APM sm t1 · · · tn s1 ... APA sm s1 · · · sm t1 · · · tn s1 ... 0 APM 0 sm t1 ...

APA T is the transpose of APA. means of AAP, also by means of AAP, and this is equivalent (the proof is analogous, and relies on Eqs. (6), (4), and (2)). The two Tables 2a and 2b are interesting per se, and can be analyzed in several different ways. In the following we propose an analysis based on network analysis techniques, mainly Kleinbergs HITS algorithm. There is a little further discussion of these normalizations in Sect. 6. 3.4 3rd step: Systems-Topics Graph The two tables 2a and 2b can be merged into a single one with the procedure shown in Fig. 1. The obtained matrix can be interpreted as the adjacency matrix of a complete weighted bipartite graph, that we call Systems-Topics graph. Arcs and weights in the graph can be interpreted as follows: • (weight on) arc s → t: how much the system s thinks that the topic t is easy - assuming that a system has no knowledge of the other systems (or in other words, how easy we might think the topic is, knowing only the results for this one system). This corresponds to APM values, i.e., to normalized topic ease (Fig. 2a). • (weight on) arc s ← t: how much the topic t thinks that the system s is good - assuming that a topic has no knowledge of the other topics (or in other words, how good we might think the system is, knowing only the results for this one topic). This corresponds to APA (normalized system effectiveness, Fig. 2b). Figs. 2c and 2d show the Systems-Topics complete weighted bipartite graph, on a toy example with 4 systems and 2 topics; the graph is split in two parts to have an understandable graphical representation: arcs in Fig. 2c are labeled with APM values; arcs in Fig. 2d are labeled with APA values. 4. ANALYSIS OF THE GRAPH 4.1 Weighted Inlinks, Outlinks, PageRank The sum of weighted outlinks, i.e., the sum of the weights on the outgoing arcs from each node, is always zero: • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a system s (Fig. 2c) is the sum of all the corresponding APM values on one row of the matrix in Tab. 2b. • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a topic t (Fig. 2d) is the sum of all the corresponding APA (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 2: The relationships between systems and topics (a) and (b); and the Systems-Topics graph for a toy example (c) and (d). Dashed arcs correspond to negative values. h (a) s1 ... sm t1 ... tn = s1 · · · sm t1 · · · tn s1 ... 0 APM (APA) sm t1 ... APA T 0 tn (APM T ) · a (h) s1 ... sm t1 ... tn Figure 3: Hub and Authority computation values on one row of the transpose of the matrix in Tab. 2a. The average1 of weighted inlinks is: • MAP for each node corresponding to a system s; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APA values on one column of the APA T part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1). • AAP for each node corresponding to a topic t; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APM values on one column of the APM part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1). Therefore, weighted inlinks measure either system effectiveness or topic ease; weighted outlinks are not meaningful. We could also apply the PageRank algorithm to the network; the meaning of the PageRank of a node is not quite so obvious as Inlinks and Outlinks, but it also seems a sensible measure of either system effectiveness or topic ease: if a system is effective, it will have several incoming links with high 1 Usually, the sum of the weights on the incoming arcs to each node is used in place of the average; since the graph is complete, it makes no difference. weights (APA); if a topic is easy it will have high weights (APM) on the incoming links too. We will see experimental confirmation in the following. 4.2 Hubs and Authorities Let us now turn to more sophisticated indicators. Kleinbergs HITS algorithm defines, for a directed graph, two indicators: hubness and authority; we reiterate here some of the basic details of the HITS algorithm in order to emphasize both the nature of our generalization and the interpretation of the HITS concepts in this context. Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs. As it is well known, an equivalent formulation in linear algebra terms is (see also Fig. 3): h = Aa and a = AT h (7) (where h is the hubness vector, with the hub values for all the nodes; a is the authority vector; A is the adjacency matrix of the graph; and AT its transpose). Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs. Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph. An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs. Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights. And, also, a good unhub links positively good unauthorities and negatively good authorities; a good unauthority is linked positively from good unhubs and negatively from good hubs. Let us now apply generalized HITS to our Systems-Topics graph. We compute a(s), h(s), a(t), and h(t). Intuitively, we expect that a(s) is somehow similar to Inlinks, so it should be a measure of either systems effectiveness or topic ease. Similarly, hubness should be more similar to Outlinks, thus less meaningful, although the interplay between hub and authority might lead to the discovery of something different. Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3. Thus the two graphs in Figs. 2c and 2d can be analyzed independently. In fact the entire HITS analysis could be done in one direction only, with just APM(s, t) values or alternatively with just APA(s, t). As discussed below, probably most interest resides in the hubness of topics and the authority of systems, so the latter makes sense. However, in this paper, we pursue both analyses together, because the symmetry itself is interesting. Considering Fig. 2c we can state that: • Authority a(t) of a topic node t increases when: - if h(si) > 0, APM(si, t) increases (or if APM(si, t) > 0, h(si) increases); - if h(si) < 0, APM(si, t) decreases (or if APM(si, t) < 0, h(si) decreases). • Hubness h(s) of a system node s increases when: - if a(tj) > 0, APM(s, tj) increases (or, if APM(s, tj) > 0, a(tj) increases); - if a(tj) < 0, APM(s, tj) decreases (or, if APM(s, tj) < 0, a(tj) decreases). We can summarize this as: a(t) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those systems with high h(s); h(s) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those topics with high a(t). Intuitively, authority a(t) of a topic measures topic ease; hubness h(s) of a system measures systems capability to recognize easy topics. A system with high unhubness (negative hubness) would tend to regard easy topics as hard and hard ones as easy. The situation for Fig. 2d, i.e., for a(s) and h(t), is analogous. Authority a(s) of a system node s measures system effectiveness: it increases with the weight on the arc (i.e., APA(s, tj)) and the hubness of the incoming topic nodes tj. Hubness h(t) of a topic node t measures topic capability to recognize effective systems: if h(t) > 0, it increases further if APA(s, tj) increases; if h(t) < 0, it increases if APA(s, tj) decreases. Intuitively, we can state that A system has a higher authority if it is more effective on topics with high hubness; and A topic has a higher hubness if it is easier for those systems which are more effective in general. Conversely for system hubness and topic authority: A topic has a higher authority if it is easier on systems with high hubness; and A system has a higher hubness if it is more effective for those topics which are easier in general. Therefore, for each system we have two indicators: authority (a(s)), measuring system effectiveness, and hubness (h(s)), measuring system capability to estimate topic ease. And for each topic, we have two indicators: authority (a(t)), measuring topic ease, and hubness (h(t)), measuring topic capability to estimate systems effectiveness. We can define them formally as a(s) = X t h(t) · APA(s, t), h(t) = X s a(s) · APA(s, t), a(t) = X s h(s) · APM(s, t), h(s) = X t a(t) · APM(s, t). We observe that the hubness of topics may be of particular interest for evaluation studies. It may be that we can evaluate the effectiveness of systems efficiently by using relatively few high-hubness topics. 5. EXPERIMENTS We now turn to discuss if these indicators are meaningful and useful in practice, and how they correlate with standard measures used in TREC. We have built the Systems-Topics graph for TREC 8 data (featuring 1282 systems - actually, 2 Actually, TREC 8 data features 129 systems; due to some bug in our scripts, we did not include one system (8manexT3D1N0), but the results should not be affected. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 NAPM NAPA AP Figure 4: Distributions of AP, APA, and APM values in TREC 8 data MAP In PR H A MAP 1 1.0 1.0 .80 .99 Inlinks 1 1.0 .80 .99 PageRank 1 .80 .99 Hub 1 .87 (a) AAP In PR H A AAP 1 1.0 1.0 .92 1.0 Inlinks 1 1.0 .92 1.0 PageRank 1 .92 1.0 Hub 1 .93 (b) Table 3: Correlations between network analysis measures and MAP (a) and AAP (b) runs - on 50 topics). This section illustrates the results obtained mining these data according to the method presented in previous sections. Fig. 4 shows the distributions of AP, APA, and APM: whereas AP is very skewed, both APA and APM are much more symmetric (as it should be, since they are constructed by subtracting the mean). Tables 3a and 3b show the Pearsons correlation values between Inlinks, PageRank, Hub, Authority and, respectively, MAP or AAP (Outlinks values are not shown since they are always zero, as seen in Sect. 4). As expected, Inlinks and PageRank have a perfect correlation with MAP and AAP. Authority has a very high correlation too with MAP and AAP; Hub assumes slightly lower values. Let us analyze the correlations more in detail. The correlations chart in Figs. 5a and 5b demonstrate the high correlation between Authority and MAP or AAP. Hubness presents interesting phenomena: both Fig. 5c (correlation with MAP) and Fig. 5d (correlation with AAP) show that correlation is not exact, but neither is it random. This, given the meaning of hubness (capability in estimating topic ease and system effectiveness), means two things: (i) more effective systems are better at estimating topic ease; and (ii) easier topics are better at estimating system effectiveness. Whereas the first statement is fine (there is nothing against it), the second is a bit worrying. It means that system effectiveness in TREC is affected more by easy topics than by difficult topics, which is rather undesirable for quite obvious reasons: a system capable of performing well on a difficult topic, i.e., on a topic on which the other systems perform badly, would be an important result for IR effectiveness; con-8E-5 -6E-5 -4E-5 -2E-5 0E+0 2E-5 4E-5 6E-5 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 -3E-1 -2E-1 -1E-1 0E+0 1E-1 2E-1 3E-1 4E-1 5E-1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 (a) (b) 0E+0 2E-2 4E-2 6E-2 8E-2 1E-1 1E-1 1E-1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0E+0 1E-5 2E-5 3E-5 4E-5 5E-5 6E-5 7E-5 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 (c) (d) Figure 5: Correlations: MAP (x axis) and authority (y axis) of systems (a); AAP and authority of topics (b); MAP and hub of systems (c) and AAP and hub of topics (d) versely, a system capable of performing well on easy topics is just a confirmation of the state of the art. Indeed, the correlation between hubness and AAP (statement (i) above) is higher than the correlation between hubness and MAP (corresponding to statement (ii)): 0.92 vs. 0.80. However, this phenomenon is quite strong. This is also confirmed by the work being done on the TREC Robust Track [14]. In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP). The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8]. GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82. To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001). We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us). This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure. Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics. In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit. This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics). We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values. An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC. Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6. DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]). We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?. The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents. We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary? At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3. Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above. Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting. This is not the case. From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values. There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same. This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects. It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient? It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)). This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable. A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems. One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line. Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit. One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8]. We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given. This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range. The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations. What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph? It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics). Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease. Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting. For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness. Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results. It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph. Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation. Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis. However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics. However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics. This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems. As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property. GMAP is more balanced. Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets. However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set. This selection may not be straightforward, however. It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective. This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation. For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation. This is left for future work. 7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties. More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP. The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised. We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far. The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics. Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics. Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available. Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators. Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses. This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed. For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP. Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank. It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT . The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease. Hopefully, further analyses of the graph defined in this paper, according to the approach described, can be insightful for a better understanding of TREC or similar data.

Proponemos un nuevo método de método de método de nuevo método deAnálisis de datos recopilados de TREC o experimentos similares de evaluación de recuperación de información. Definimos dos versiones normalizadas de precisión promedio, que usamos para construir un gráfico bipartito ponderado de sistemas y temas TREC. Analizamos el significado de indicadores bien conocidos, y algo generalizados, del análisis de redes sociales en el gráfico de sistemas -topos. Aplicamos este método a un análisis de los datos de TREC 8;Entre los resultados, encontramos que la autoridad mide el rendimiento de los sistemas, que el obstáculo de los temas revela que algunos temas son mejores que otros para distinguir sistemas más o menos efectivos, que con las medidas actuales un sistema que quiere ser efectivo en TREC debe ser efectivo en los que debe ser efectivo.Temas fáciles, y que al usar diferentes medidas de efectividad, este ya no es el caso. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos H.3.3 [Almacenamiento y recuperación de información]: Búsqueda y recuperación de información Términos generales Medición, Experimentación 1. La evaluación de la introducción es una preocupación principal en el campo de recuperación de información (IR). TREC (Conferencia de recuperación de texto) [12, 15] es un ejercicio de evaluación comparativa anual que se ha convertido en un estándar de facto en la evaluación IR: antes de la conferencia real, TREC proporciona a los participantes una colección de documentos y un conjunto de temas (representaciones de necesidades de información). Los participantes usan sus sistemas para recuperar y enviar a TREC, una lista de documentos para cada tema. Después de que las listas se hayan presentado y agrupado, los organizadores de TREC emplean asesores humanos para proporcionar juicios de relevancia en el conjunto agrupado. Esto define un conjunto de documentos relevantes para cada tema. La efectividad del sistema se mide mediante métricas bien establecidas (la precisión promedio media es la más utilizada). Otras conferencias como NTCIR, INEX, CLEF proporcionan datos comparables. El análisis de red es una disciplina que estudia características y propiedades de las redes o gráficos (generalmente grandes). De particular importancia es el análisis de redes sociales [16], que estudia redes formadas por enlaces entre humanos (amistad, conocido, coautoría, cita bibliográfica, etc.). El análisis de la red y el IR se reúnen fructíferamente en la implementación del motor de búsqueda web, como ya se describe en los libros de texto [3,6]. Los motores de búsqueda actuales utilizan técnicas de análisis de enlaces para ayudar a clasificar los documentos recuperados. Algunos indicadores (y los algoritmos correspondientes que los calculan) se han encontrado útiles a este respecto, y hoy en día son bien conocidos: Inlinks (el número de enlaces a una página web), Pagerank [7] y Hits (búsqueda de temas inducida por hipervínculos) [5]. Varias extensiones a estos algoritmos han sido y se están propuestos. Estos indicadores y algoritmos pueden ser de naturaleza bastante general, y pueden usarse para aplicaciones que son muy diferentes de la clasificación de resultados de búsqueda. Un ejemplo es usar éxitos para Stemming, según lo descrito por Agosti et al.[1]. En este artículo, proponemos y demostramos un método para construir una red, específicamente un gráfico bipartito dirigido bidireccional completo ponderado, en un conjunto de temas de TREC y sistemas participantes. Los enlaces representan mediciones de efectividad en los pares de tope del sistema. Luego aplicamos métodos de análisis desarrollados originalmente para aplicaciones de búsqueda a la red resultante. Esto revela fenómenos previamente ocultos en los datos de TREC. Al pasar, también proporcionamos una pequeña generalización al algoritmo de Kleinbergs Hits, así como a Inlinks y PageRank. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: Secta.2 da algunas motivaciones para el trabajo. Secta.3 presenta las ideas básicas de normalizar la precisión promedio y de construir un gráfico de sistemas de sistemas, cuyas propiedades se analizan en la sección.4;Secta.5 presenta algunos experimentos sobre datos de TREC 8;Secta.6 discute algunos temas y secta.7 cierra el papel.2. Motivaciones que estamos interesados en las siguientes hipótesis: 1. Algunos sistemas son más efectivos que otros;T1 · · · TN MAP S1 AP (S1, T1) · · · AP (S1, TN) MAP (S1) ... ... ... SM AP (SM, T1) · · · AP (SM, TN) MAP (SM) AAP AAP (T1) · · · AAP (TN) (A) T1 T2 · · · MAP S1 0.5 0.4 · · · 0.6 S2 0.4 · · · · · · · 0.3 ... ... .... ... AAP 0.6 0.3 · · · (b) Tabla 1: AP, MAP y AAP 2. Algunos temas son más fáciles que otros;3. Algunos sistemas son mejores que otros para distinguir temas fáciles y difíciles;4. Algunos temas son mejores que otros para distinguir sistemas más o menos efectivos. La primera de estas hipótesis no necesita más justificación: cada una de las dos diferencias entre los dos sistemas lo respalda. Ahora también hay mucha evidencia del segundo, centrado en la pista robusta de TREC [14]. Nuestro interés principal está en el tercero y cuarto. El tercero podría considerarse como de interés puramente académico;Sin embargo, el cuarto tiene el potencial de ser de gran importancia práctica en los estudios de evaluación. Si pudiéramos identificar un número relativamente pequeño de temas que fueran realmente buenos para distinguir sistemas efectivos e ineficaces, podríamos ahorrar un esfuerzo considerable para evaluar los sistemas. Una posible dirección desde este punto sería intentar la identificación directa de tan pequeños conjuntos de temas. Sin embargo, en el presente documento, buscamos explorar las relaciones sugeridas por las hipótesis, entre lo que los diferentes temas nos dicen sobre los sistemas y lo que los diferentes sistemas nos dicen sobre los temas. Buscamos métodos para construir y analizar una matriz de rendimientos normalizados de topicle de sistema, con el fin de dar información sobre el problema y confirmar o refutar la tercera y cuarta hipótesis. Resulta que la simetría obvia implícita en la formulación anterior de las hipótesis es una propiedad que vale la pena investigar, y la investigación realmente nos da información valiosa.3. La idea 3.1 1er paso: tabla de precisión promedio de los resultados de TREC, uno puede producir una tabla de precisión promedio (AP) (ver Tab. 1A): cada valor AP (SI, TJ) mide la AP de System SI en el tema TJ. Además de los valores de AP, la tabla muestra valores medios de precisión promedio (MAP), es decir, la media de los valores AP para un solo sistema sobre todos los temas, y lo que llamamos valores promedio de precisión promedio (AAP), es decir, el promedio de los valores AP paraUn solo tema sobre todos los sistemas: MAP (SI) = 1 N NX J = 1 AP (SI, TJ), (1) AAP (TJ) = 1 M MX I = 1 AP (Si, TJ).(2) Los mapas son indicadores del rendimiento de los sistemas: el mapa más alto significa un buen sistema. AAP son indicadores del rendimiento sobre un tema: AAP más alto significa un tema fácil, un tema sobre el cual todos o la mayoría de los sistemas tienen un buen rendimiento.3.2 La crítica del mapa AP puro es una medida de efectividad IR estándar, bien conocida y ampliamente utilizada. Los valores de AP individuales también se usan (por ejemplo, en histogramas AP). La dificultad del tema a menudo se discute (por ejemplo, en la pista robusta de TREC [14]), aunque los valores de AAP no se usan y, hasta donde sabemos, nunca se han propuesto (la mediana, no el promedio, de AP en un tema esutilizado para producir histogramas TREC AP [11]). Sin embargo, los valores AP en la pestaña.1 Presente dos limitaciones, que son simétricas en cierto aspecto: • Problema 1. No son confiables para comparar la efectividad de un sistema en diferentes temas, en relación con los otros sistemas. Si, por ejemplo, AP (S1, T1)> AP (S1, T2), ¿podemos inferir que S1 es un buen sistema (es decir, tiene un buen rendimiento) en T1 y un sistema malo en T2? La respuesta es no: T1 podría ser un tema fácil (con AAP alto) y T2 difícil (AAP bajo). Ver un ejemplo en la pestaña.1B: S1 es superado (en promedio) por los otros sistemas en T1, y supera a los otros sistemas en T2.• Problema 2. Por el contrario, si, por ejemplo, AP (S1, T1)> AP (S2, T1), ¿podemos inferir que T1 es considerado más fácil por S1 que por S2? No, no podemos: S1 podría ser un buen sistema (con mapa alto) y S2 uno malo (mapa bajo);Ver un ejemplo en la pestaña.1b. Estos dos problemas son una especie de desglose de la conocida alta influencia de los temas en la evaluación IR;Nuevamente, nuestra formulación hace explícita la simetría de temas / sistemas.3.3 2do paso: Normalizaciones Para evitar estos dos problemas, podemos normalizar la tabla AP de dos maneras. La primera normalización elimina la influencia del tema único en el rendimiento del sistema. Cada valor AP (SI, TJ) en la tabla depende de la bondad del sistema y la facilidad del tema (el valor aumentará si un sistema es bueno y/o el tema es fácil). Al restar de cada AP (SI, TJ) el valor AAP (TJ), obtenemos valores AP normalizados (APA (SI, TJ), AP normalizado según AAP): APA (Si, TJ) = AP (Si, TJ)- AAP (TJ), (3) que dependen solo del rendimiento del sistema (el valor aumentará solo si el rendimiento del sistema es bueno). Ver pestaña.2a. La segunda normalización elimina la influencia de la efectividad del sistema único en la facilidad del tema: al restar de cada AP (SI, TJ) el valor del mapa (Si), obtenemos valores AP normalizados (APM (SI, TJ), AP normalizado según MAP): Apm (si, tj) = ap (si, tj) - mapa (Si), (4) que dependen solo de la facilidad del tema (el valor aumentará solo si el tema es fácil, es decir, todos los sistemas funcionan bien en el quetema). Ver pestaña.2b. En otras palabras, la APA evita el problema 1: los valores APA (S, T) miden el rendimiento del sistema S en el tema T Normalizado T1 · · · TN MAP S1 APA (S1, T1) · · · APA (S1, TN) MAP () MAP (S1) ... ... ... SM APA (SM, T1) · · · APA (SM, TN) MAP (SM) 0 · · · 0 0 (A) T1 · · · TN S1 APM (S1,T1) · · · APM (S1, TN) 0 ... ... ... SM APM (SM, T1) · · · APM (SM, TN) 0 AAP AAP (T1) · · · AAP (TN)0 (b) T1 T2 · · · MAP S1 −0.1 0.1 · · ·...S2 0.2 · · · · · ·...... ... ... 0 0 · · · T1 T2 · · · S1 −0.1 −0.2 · · · 0 S2 0.1 · · · · · · 0 ... ... ... ... aap......· · · (C) (d) Tabla 2: Normalizaciones: APA y MAP: AP (APA) y mapa normalizados (MAP) (A);AP (APM) normalizado y AAP (AAP) (B);Un ejemplo numérico (c) y (d) según la facilidad del tema (los temas fáciles no tendrán valores APA más altos). Ahora, si, por ejemplo, APA (S1, T2)> APA (S1, T1), podemos inferir que S1 es un buen sistema en T2 y un sistema malo en T1 (ver Tab. 2C). Viceversa, APM evita el problema 2: los valores APM (S, T) miden la facilidad del tema T de acuerdo con el sistema S, normalizado según la bondad del sistema (los buenos sistemas no conducirán a valores de APM más altos). Si, por ejemplo, APM (S2, T1)> APM (S1, T1), podemos inferir que T1 es considerado más fácil por S2 que por S1 (ver Tab. 2d). Sobre la base de las Tablas 2A y 2B, también podemos definir dos nuevas medidas de efectividad del sistema y facilidad del tema, es decir, un mapa normalizado (MAP), obtenido promediando los valores APA en una fila en la pestaña.2A, y un AAP normalizado (AAP), obtenido promediando los valores APM en una columna en la pestaña.2b: map (si) = 1 n nx j = 1 apa (si, tj) (5) aap (tj) = 1 m mx i = 1 apm (si, tj).(6) Por lo tanto, el rendimiento general del sistema se puede medir, además de MAP, también por medio del mapa. Además, el mapa es equivalente al mapa, como se puede probar de inmediato mediante el uso de las ecuaciones.(5), (3) y (1): MAP (Si) = 1 n nx j = 1 (ap (si, tj) - aap (tj)) = = map (si) - 1 n nx j = 1AAP (TJ) (y 1 N PN J = 1 AAP (TJ) es lo mismo para todos los sistemas). Y, por el contrario, se puede medir la facilidad general del tema, además de T1 · · · TN S1 ... APM SM T1 · · · TN S1 ... APA SM S1 · · · SM T1 · · · TN S1 ... 0APM 0 SM T1 ... APA T 0 0 TN MAP AAP 0 Figura 1: Construcción de la matriz de adyacencia. Apa t es la transposición de APA.medias de AAP, también por medio de AAP, y esto es equivalente (la prueba es análoga y se basa en la ecuación (6), (4) y (2)). Las dos tablas 2a y 2b son interesantes per se, y se pueden analizar de varias maneras diferentes. A continuación, proponemos un análisis basado en técnicas de análisis de red, principalmente Kleinbergs alcanza el algoritmo. Hay una pequeña discusión sobre estas normalizaciones en la secta.6. 3.4 3er paso: los sistemas-topos gráficos Las dos tablas 2a y 2b se pueden fusionar en una sola con el procedimiento que se muestra en la figura 1. La matriz obtenida se puede interpretar como la matriz de adyacencia de un gráfico bipartito pesado completo, que llamamos gráfico de topicaciones de sistemas. Los arcos y los pesos en el gráfico se pueden interpretar de la siguiente manera: • (peso en) arc s → t: cuánto cree el sistema s que el tema t es fácil, suponiendo que un sistema no tiene conocimiento de los otros sistemas (o en otrosPalabras, cuán fácil podríamos pensar que es el tema, conociendo solo los resultados para este sistema). Esto corresponde a los valores de APM, es decir, a la facilidad de tema normalizada (Fig. 2A).• (peso) arco s ← t: cuánto cree el tema t que el sistema es bueno, suponiendo que un tema no tiene conocimiento de los otros temas (o en otras palabras, cuán bueno podríamos pensar que es el sistema, saberSolo los resultados para este tema). Esto corresponde a APA (efectividad normalizada del sistema, Fig. 2B). Figs.2C y 2D muestran que los sistemas-topics completan un gráfico bipartito ponderado, en un ejemplo de juguete con 4 sistemas y 2 temas;El gráfico se divide en dos partes para tener una representación gráfica comprensible: los arcos en la Fig. 2c están etiquetados con valores APM;Los arcos en la Fig. 2D están etiquetados con valores APA.4. Análisis del gráfico 4.1 Inlinks ponderados, Outlinks, PageRank La suma de los ataques ponderados, es decir, la suma de los pesos en los arcos salientes de cada nodo, siempre es cero: • Los vínculos en cada nodo correspondiente a un sistema s (Fig.2c) es la suma de todos los valores APM correspondientes en una fila de la matriz en la pestaña.2b.• Los ataques en cada nodo correspondiente a un tema t (Fig. 2D) es la suma de todos los APA (a) (b) (c) (d) 2: las relaciones entre sistemas y temas (a) y ((a) (d) (d) (d) (d).b);y el gráfico Systems-Topics para un ejemplo de juguete (c) y (d). Los arcos discontinuos corresponden a valores negativos.H (a) S1 ... SM T1 ... TN = S1 · · · SM T1 · · · TN S1 ... 0 APM (APA) SM T1 ... APA T 0 TN (APM T) · A (H) S1 ... SM T1 ... TN Figura 3: Hub y valores de cálculo de autoridad en una fila de la transposición de la matriz en la pestaña.2a. El promedio1 de los insultos ponderados es: • Mapa para cada nodo correspondiente a un sistema S;Esto corresponde al promedio de todos los valores APA correspondientes en una columna de la parte APA T de la matriz de adyacencia (ver Fig. 1).• AAP para cada nodo correspondiente a un tema t;Esto corresponde al promedio de todos los valores APM correspondientes en una columna de la parte APM de la matriz de adyacencia (ver Fig. 1). Por lo tanto, los inslinques ponderados miden la efectividad del sistema o la facilidad del tema;Los ataques con peso no son significativos. También podríamos aplicar el algoritmo de PageRank a la red;El significado del PageRank de un nodo no es tan obvio como los enlinks y los ataques, pero también parece una medida sensata de efectividad del sistema o facilidad del tema: si un sistema es efectivo, tendrá varios enlaces entrantes con High 1, por lo general, generalmente, por lo general,La suma de los pesos en los arcos entrantes a cada nodo se usa en lugar del promedio;Como el gráfico está completo, no hay diferencia.Pesos (APA);Si un tema es fácil, también tendrá altos pesos (APM) en los enlaces entrantes. Veremos la confirmación experimental a continuación.4.2 centros y autoridades ahora recurrimos a indicadores más sofisticados. Kleinbergs llega al algoritmo define, para un gráfico dirigido, dos indicadores: Hubness y Autoridad;Reiteramos aquí algunos de los detalles básicos del algoritmo de éxitos para enfatizar tanto la naturaleza de nuestra generalización como la interpretación de los conceptos de éxitos en este contexto. Por lo general, el centro y la autoridad se definen como h (x) = p x → y a (y) y a (x) = p y → x h (y), y se describen intuitivamente como un buen centro vincula muchas buenas autoridades;Una buena autoridad está vinculada desde muchos buenos centros. Como es bien conocido, una formulación equivalente en términos de álgebra lineal es (ver también la Fig. 3): H = aa y a = en H (7) (donde H es el vector de Hubness, con los valores de HUB para todos los nodos;A es el vector de autoridad; a es la matriz de adyacencia del gráfico; y en su transposición). Por lo general, A contiene 0s y 1 solo, correspondiente a la presencia y ausencia de arcos dirigidos no ponderados, pero la ecuación.(7) se puede generalizar de inmediato a (de hecho, ya es válido para) un valor real, es decir, a gráficos ponderados. Por lo tanto, podemos tener una versión generalizada (o más bien una interpretación generalizada, ya que la formulación sigue siendo la original) de Hubness y Autoridad para todos los nodos en un gráfico. Una formulación intuitiva de estos éxitos generalizados todavía está disponible, aunque un poco más compleja: un buen centro de enlaces, por medio de arcos que tienen altos pesos, muchas buenas autoridades;Una buena autoridad está vinculada, por medio de arcos que tienen pesos altos, de muchos buenos centros. Dado que los pesos de ARC pueden ser, en general, negativos, los valores de Hub y de autoridad pueden ser negativos, y uno podría hablar de la infracción y la falta de falta de la falta de autoridad;La formulación intuitiva podría completarse agregando que un buen centro vincula buenas no autoridades mediante vínculos con pesos altamente negativos;Una buena autoridad está vinculada por buenos Untubs por medio de enlaces con pesos altamente negativos. Y, también, un buen unhub enlaces positivamente buenas no autoridades y buenas autoridades negativamente;Una buena insegura está vinculada positivamente de buenos Untubs y negativamente de buenos centros. Aplicemos ahora éxitos generalizados a nuestro gráfico de topicales de sistemas. Calculamos A (S), H (S), A (T) y H (T). Intuitivamente, esperamos que A (S) sea de alguna manera similar a las influentes, por lo que debería ser una medida de la efectividad del sistema o la facilidad del tema. Del mismo modo, el Hubness debería ser más similar a los ataques, por lo tanto, menos significativos, aunque la interacción entre Hub y la autoridad podría conducir al descubrimiento de algo diferente. Comencemos por remarcar que la autoridad de los temas y el Hubness de los sistemas depende solo de los demás;Del mismo modo, el centro de temas y la autoridad de los sistemas dependen solo entre sí: ver Figs.2c, 2d y 3. Así, los dos gráficos en las Figs.2C y 2D se pueden analizar de forma independiente. De hecho, todo el análisis de éxitos podría hacerse en una sola dirección, con solo valores APM (S, T) o alternativamente con solo APA (S, T). Como se discute a continuación, probablemente la mayoría de los intereses reside en el Hubness de los temas y la autoridad de los sistemas, por lo que este último tiene sentido. Sin embargo, en este artículo, seguimos ambos análisis juntos, porque la simetría en sí misma es interesante. Teniendo en cuenta la Fig. 2C podemos afirmar que: • La autoridad A (t) de un nodo de tema T aumenta cuando: - Si h (Si)> 0, APM (Si, T) aumenta (o si APM (Si, T)> 0, H (Si) aumenta);- Si H (Si) <0, APM (Si, T) disminuye (o si APM (Si, T) <0, H (Si) disminuye).• Hubness H (s) de un nodo del sistema S aumenta cuando: - si a (TJ)> 0, APM (S, TJ) aumenta (o, si APM (S, TJ)> 0, A (TJ) aumenta);- Si A (TJ) <0, APM (S, TJ) disminuye (o, si APM (S, TJ) <0, A (TJ) disminuye). Podemos resumir esto como: A (T) es alto si APM (S, T) es alto para aquellos sistemas con H altas H (S);H (s) es alto si APM (S, T) es alto para aquellos temas con ALTH A (T). Intuitivamente, la autoridad a (t) de un tema mide la facilidad del tema;Hubness H (s) de un sistema mide la capacidad de sistemas para reconocer temas fáciles. Un sistema con alta infracción (Hubness negativo) tendería a considerar temas fáciles como los que sean difíciles y duros como fáciles. La situación para la Fig. 2D, es decir, para A (S) y H (T), es análoga. Autoridad A (S) de un nodo del sistema m mide la efectividad del sistema: aumenta con el peso en el arco (es decir, APA (S, TJ)) y la hub de los nodos de temas entrantes TJ. Hubness H (t) de un nodo temático T mide la capacidad del tema para reconocer sistemas efectivos: si h (t)> 0, aumenta aún más si APA (S, TJ) aumenta;Si h (t) <0, aumenta si APA (S, TJ) disminuye. Intuitivamente, podemos afirmar que un sistema tiene una autoridad más alta si es más efectivo en temas con altas medidas;Y un tema tiene un Hubness más alto si es más fácil para aquellos sistemas que son más efectivos en general. Por el contrario, para el Hubness del sistema y la autoridad temática: un tema tiene una autoridad superior si es más fácil en los sistemas con alta obstáculo;Y un sistema tiene un Hubness más alto si es más efectivo para aquellos temas que son más fáciles en general. Por lo tanto, para cada sistema tenemos dos indicadores: autoridad (A (S)), medición de la efectividad del sistema y Hubness (H (S)), la capacidad de medición del sistema para estimar la facilidad del tema. Y para cada tema, tenemos dos indicadores: autoridad (A (t)), medición de la facilidad del tema y el Hubness (H (t)), midiendo la capacidad del tema para estimar la efectividad de los sistemas. Podemos definirlos formalmente como (s) = x t h (t) · apa (s, t), h (t) = x s a (s) · apa (s, t), a (t) = x s h (s) · apm (s, t), h (s) = x t a (t) · apm (s, t). Observamos que la Hubness de los temas puede ser de particular interés para los estudios de evaluación. Puede ser que podamos evaluar la efectividad de los sistemas de manera eficiente mediante el uso de relativamente pocos temas de alta albergue.5. Experimentos ahora recurrimos para discutir si estos indicadores son significativos y útiles en la práctica, y cómo se correlacionan con las medidas estándar utilizadas en TREC. Hemos creado el gráfico de sistemas -topos para los datos de TREC 8 (con 1282 sistemas, en realidad, 2 en realidad, TREC 8 Data Características 129 sistemas; debido a algún error en nuestros scripts, no incluimos un sistema (8MANEXT3D1N0), pero los resultados de los resultadosno debe verse afectado. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 NAPM NAPA AP Figura 4: Distribuciones de valores AP, APA y APM en TREC 8 Mapa de datos en PR H A MAP 1 1.0 1.0 .80 .99 Inlinks 1 1.0.80 .99 PageRank 1 .80 .99 Hub 1 .87 (a) AAP en Pr H A AAP 1 1.0 1.0 .92 1.0 Inlinks 1 1.0 .92 1.0 PageRank 1 .92 1.0 Hub 1 .93 (b) Tabla 3: Correlacionesentre las medidas de análisis de red y el mapa (a) y la AAP (b) se ejecutan en 50 temas). Esta sección ilustra los resultados obtenidos minando estos datos de acuerdo con el método presentado en secciones anteriores. La figura 4 muestra las distribuciones de AP, APA y APM: mientras que AP está muy sesgada, tanto APA como APM son mucho más simétricas (como debería ser, ya que se construyen restando la media). Las tablas 3a y 3b muestran los valores de correlación de Pearsons entre INLINKS, PageRank, Hub, Autoridad y, respectivamente, MAP o AAP (los valores de los enlaces no se muestran ya que siempre son cero, como se ve en la Secta 4). Como se esperaba, Inlinks y PageRank tienen una correlación perfecta con MAP y AAP. La autoridad también tiene una correlación muy alta con MAP y AAP;Hub asume valores ligeramente más bajos. Analicemos las correlaciones más en detalle. La tabla de correlaciones en las Figs.5a y 5b demuestran la alta correlación entre autoridad y mapa o AAP. Hubness presenta fenómenos interesantes: tanto la Fig. 5C (correlación con MAP) como la Fig. 5D (correlación con AAP) muestran que la correlación no es exacta, pero tampoco es aleatorio. Esto, dado el significado de Hubness (capacidad en la estimación de la facilidad del tema y la efectividad del sistema), significa dos cosas: (i) los sistemas más efectivos son mejores para estimar la facilidad del tema;y (ii) los temas más fáciles son mejores para estimar la efectividad del sistema. Mientras que la primera declaración está bien (no hay nada en su contra), la segunda es un poco preocupante. Significa que la efectividad del sistema en TREC se ve más afectada por temas fáciles que por temas difíciles, que es bastante indeseable por razones bastante obvias: un sistema capaz de funcionar bien en un tema difícil, es decir, en un tema sobre el cual los otros sistemas funcionan mal., sería un resultado importante para la efectividad IR;Con-8E-5 -6E-5 -4E-5 -2E-5 0E+0 2E-5 4E-5 6E-5 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 -3e-1 -2e-1 -1e-1 0e+01e-1 2e-1 3e-1 4e-1 5e-1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 (a) (b) 0e+0 2e-2 4e-2 6e-2 8e-2 1e-1 1e-1 1e-1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0e+0 1e-5 2e-5 3e-5 4e-5 5e-5 6e-5 7e-5 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 (c) (d) Figura5: Correlaciones: mapa (eje x) y autoridad (eje y) de sistemas (a);AAP y autoridad de temas (b);Mapa y centro de sistemas (c) y AAP y un concentrador de temas (d) versamente, un sistema capaz de funcionar bien en temas fáciles es solo una confirmación del estado de la técnica. De hecho, la correlación entre Hubness y AAP (Declaración (i) arriba) es mayor que la correlación entre el Hubness y el MAP (correspondiente a la declaración (ii)): 0.92 vs. 0.80. Sin embargo, este fenómeno es bastante fuerte. Esto también está confirmado por el trabajo que se realiza en la pista robusta de TREC [14]. A este respecto, es interesante ver qué sucede si usamos una medida diferente de MAP (y AAP). La métrica GMAP (MAP geométrica) se define como la media geométrica de los valores AP, o de manera equivalente como la media aritmética de los logaritmos de los valores AP [8]. GMAP tiene la propiedad de dar más peso al extremo bajo de la escala AP (es decir, valores AP bajos), y esto parece razonable, ya que, intuitivamente, un aumento de rendimiento en los valores de MAP de 0.01 a 0.02 debería ser más importante que unAumento de 0.81 a 0.82. Para usar GMAP en lugar de MAP y AAP, solo necesitamos tomar los logaritmos de los valores AP iniciales, es decir, los que están en la pestaña.1a (los valores cero se modifican en ε = 0.00001). Luego repitimos el mismo proceso de normalización (con GMAP y GAAP - AAP geométrico - Reemplazo de MAP y AAP): mientras que los valores de autoridad aún se correlacionan perfectamente con GMAP (0.99) y GAAP (1.00), la correlación con el Hubness desaparece en gran medida (los valores son −0.16y −0.09 - ligeramente negativo pero no lo suficiente como para preocuparnos). Esta es otra confirmación de que la efectividad de TREC medida por MAP depende principalmente de temas fáciles;GMAP parece ser una medida más equilibrada. Tenga en cuenta que, quizás sorprendentemente, GMAP está bastante bien equilibrado, no sesgado en la dirección opuesta, es decir, no enfatiza demasiado los temas difíciles. Insecto.6.3 A continuación, discutimos otra transformación, reemplazando la función log utilizada en GMAP con logit. Esto tiene un efecto similar: la correlación de la logitap media y la logitap promedio con el Hubness ahora son pequeños números positivos (0.23 y 0.15 respectivamente), aún así cómodamente de las altas correlaciones con MAP regular y AAP, es decir, no presentar el fenómeno problemático (II) arriba (sobredependencia sobre temas fáciles). También observamos que los valores de HUB son positivos, mientras que la autoridad asume, como se predijo, tanto valores positivos como negativos. Una justificación intuitiva es que el Hubness negativo indicaría un nodo que no está de acuerdo con los otros nodos, por ejemplo, un sistema que funciona mejor en temas difíciles o un tema sobre el cual los sistemas malos funcionan mejor;Tales sistemas y temas serían bastante extraños, y probablemente no aparecen en TREC. Finalmente, aunque uno podría pensar que los temas con varios documentos relevantes son más importantes y difíciles, este no es el caso: no hay correlación entre HUB (o cualquier otro indicador) y el número de documentos relevantes para un tema.6. Discusión 6.1 Trabajo relacionado Ha habido un interés considerable en los últimos años en cuestiones de importancia estadística de comparaciones de efectividad entre los sistemas (por ejemplo, [2, 9]), y cuestiones relacionadas sobre cuántos temas podrían ser necesarios para establecer diferencias (por ejemplo, [13]). Consideramos algunos resultados del presente estudio como de alguna manera complementario a este trabajo, ya que damos un paso para responder la pregunta ¿Qué temas son mejores para establecer diferencias? Los resultados sobre la evaluación sin juicios de relevancia como [10] muestran que, en cierta medida, los buenos sistemas están de acuerdo sobre cuáles son los buenos documentos. No hemos abordado la cuestión de los documentos individuales en el presente análisis, pero este efecto es ciertamente análogo a nuestros resultados.6.2 ¿Son necesarias las normalizaciones? En este punto, también vale la pena analizar lo que sucedería sin las normalizaciones MAP y AAP definidas en la Secta.3.3. De hecho, el proceso de construcción de gráficos (Sect. 3.4) sigue siendo válido: las matrices APM y APA son reemplazadas por la AP, y luego todo continúa como se indicó anteriormente. Por lo tanto, uno podría pensar que las normalizaciones son inutilizadas en este entorno. Este no es el caso. Desde el punto de vista teórico, el gráfico AP solo no presenta las propiedades interesantes discutidas anteriormente: dado que el gráfico AP solo es simétrico (el peso en cada enlace entrante es igual al peso en el enlace saliente correspondiente), Inlinks yOutlinks asume los mismos valores. También hay simetría en la computación del centro y la autoridad, que suponen el mismo valor para cada nodo, ya que los pesos en los arcos entrantes y salientes son los mismos. Esto podría establecerse en términos más precisos y formales, pero uno podría preguntarse si en el gráfico general hay algún tipo de efectos de contrapeso. Por lo tanto, es más fácil observar los datos experimentales, que confirman que las normalizaciones son necesarias: las correlaciones entre AP, INLINKS, Outlinks, Hub y/o Autoridad están muy cerca de una (ninguno de ellos está por debajo de 0.98).6.3 ¿Son suficientes estas normalizaciones? Se podría argumentar que (en el caso de APA, por ejemplo) la cantidad que hemos restado de cada valor de AP depende del tema, por lo tanto, el rango del valor APA resultante también depende del tema (por ejemplo, el máximo es 1-AAP (TJ (TJ) y el mínimo es - AAP (TJ)). Esto sugiere que las comparaciones entre temas de estos valores sugeridos en la secta.3.3 puede no ser confiable. Un problema similar surge para APM y comparaciones entre los sistemas. Una posible forma de superar esto sería usar una medida sin restricciones cuyo rango es la línea real completa. Tenga en cuenta que al aplicar el método a GMAP utilizando log AP, evitamos el problema con el límite inferior pero lo conservamos para el límite superior. Una forma de lograr un rango sin restricciones sería usar la función logit en lugar del log [4,8]. También hemos ejecutado esta variante (como ya se informó en la Sección 5 anterior), y parece proporcionar resultados muy similares a los resultados de GMAP ya dados. Esto no es sorprendente, ya que en la práctica las dos funciones son muy similares en la mayor parte del rango operativo. Las normalizaciones parecen confiables.6.4 En AAT y en A es bien sabido que H y A Vectores son los principales vectores propios de AAT y en A, respectivamente (esto se puede derivar fácilmente de las ecuaciones (7)), y eso, en el caso de los gráficos de citas, AAT y en un representante, respectivamente, acoplamiento bibliográfico y co-citaciones. ¿Cuál es el significado, si alguno, de AAT y en un gráfico de T-Topics de Systems? Es fácil derivar que: aat [i, j] = 8> <>: 0  si i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T o i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S p k a [i, k] · a [j, k] de lo contrario en a [i, j] = 8> <>: 0  si i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T o i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S p k a [k, i] · a [k, j] de lo contrario (donde (dondeS es el conjunto de índices correspondientes a los sistemas y t el conjunto de índices correspondientes a temas). Por lo tanto, AAT y en A son matrices diagonales de bloque, con dos bloques cada uno, uno en relación con los sistemas y otro relativo a los temas: (a) si i, j ∈ S, entonces AAT [i, j] = p k∈T apm (i, k) · APM (J, K) mide cuánto están de acuerdo los dos sistemas I y J en la estimación de los temas (APM): los valores altos significan que los dos sistemas están de acuerdo en la facilidad de los temas.(b) Si i, j ∈ T, entonces AAT [i, j] = p k∈S apa (k, i) · apa (k, j) mide cuánto están de acuerdo los dos temas I y J en la estimación de la efectividad de los sistemas (APA): los valores altos significan que los dos temas están de acuerdo en la efectividad del sistema (y que los resultados de TREC no cambiarían al dejar de lado uno de los dos temas).(c) Si i, j ∈ S, entonces a [i, j] = p k∈T apa (i, k) · apa (j, k) mide cuánta acuerdo sobre la efectividad de dos sistemas I y J allíSe trata de todos los temas: los valores altos significan que muchos temas están bastante de acuerdo en la efectividad de los dos sistemas;Valores bajos Los sistemas individuales que de alguna manera son controvertidos, y que necesitan varios temas para tener una evaluación de efectividad correcta.(d) Si i, j ∈ T, entonces a [i, j] = p k∈S apm (k, i) · apm (k, j) mide cuánto acuerdo sobre la facilidad de los dos temas I y JExiste sobre todos los sistemas: los valores altos significan que muchos sistemas están bastante de acuerdo con los dos temas. Por lo tanto, estas matrices son significativas y de alguna manera interesantes. Por ejemplo, el submatriz (b) corresponde a un gráfico completo ponderado no dirigido, cuyos nodos son los temas y cuyos pesos de arco son una medida de cuánto están de acuerdo con la efectividad de los sistemas. Dos temas que están muy cerca en este gráfico dan la misma información y, por lo tanto, uno de ellos podría descartarse sin cambios en los resultados de TREC. Sería interesante agrupar los temas de este gráfico. Además, la matriz/gráfico (a) podría ser útil en la formación de trec piscina: los sistemas que no están de acuerdo en la facilidad del tema probablemente encontrarían diferentes documentos relevantes y, por lo tanto, deberían ser complementarios en la formación del grupo. Tenga en cuenta que no se trata de noción de documentos individuales en el análisis anterior.6.5 Insights Como se indica, la contribución principal de este documento ha sido un método de análisis. Sin embargo, en el curso de la aplicación de este método a un conjunto de resultados de TREC, hemos logrado algunas ideas relacionadas con las hipótesis formuladas en la secta.2: • Confirmamos la hipótesis 2 anterior, que algunos temas son más fáciles que otros.• Las diferencias en la Hubness de los sistemas revelan que algunos sistemas son mejores que otros para distinguir temas fáciles y difíciles;Por lo tanto, tenemos cierta confirmación de la hipótesis 3. • Hay algunos sistemas relativamente idiosincrásicos que lo hacen mal en algunos temas generalmente considerados fáciles pero bien en algunos temas difíciles. Sin embargo, en general, los sistemas más efectivos son mejores para distinguir temas fáciles y difíciles. Esto es de esperar: un sistema realmente malo funcionará mal en todo, mientras que incluso un buen sistema puede tener dificultades con algunos temas.• Las diferencias en la Hubness de los temas revelan que algunos temas son mejores que otros para distinguir sistemas más o menos efectivos;Por lo tanto, tenemos cierta confirmación de la hipótesis 4. • Si usamos MAP como medida de efectividad, también es cierto que los temas más fáciles son mejores para distinguir sistemas más o menos efectivos. Como se argumenta en la secta.5, esta es una propiedad indeseable. GMAP está más equilibrado. Claramente, estas ideas deben probarse en otros conjuntos de datos. Sin embargo, revelan que el método de análisis propuesto en este documento puede proporcionar información valiosa.6.6 Selección de temas La confirmación de los cables de la Hipótesis 4, como se indica, a la idea de que podríamos realizar una evaluación confiable del sistema en un conjunto mucho más pequeño de temas, siempre que podamos seleccionar un conjunto tan apropiado. Sin embargo, esta selección puede no ser directa. Es posible que simplemente seleccionar los temas de altura de Hubness alcance este fin;Sin embargo, también es posible que haya interacciones significativas entre los temas que hacen que una regla tan simple sea ineficaz. Por lo tanto, esta investigación requeriría una experimentación grave. Por esta razón, no hemos intentado en este documento señalar que los temas específicos de altura de su altura son buenos para la evaluación. Esto se deja para el trabajo futuro.7. Conclusiones y desarrollos futuros La contribución de este documento es triple: • Proponemos una forma novedosa de normalizar los valores de AP;• Proponemos un método novedoso para analizar los datos de TREC;• El método aplicado en los datos de TREC de hecho revela algunas propiedades ocultas. Más particularmente, proponemos la precisión promedio promedio (AAP), una medida de la facilidad del tema y una forma novedosa de normalizar la medida de precisión promedio en TREC, sobre la base de ambos MAP (precisión promedio media) y AAP. Las medidas normalizadas (APM y APA) se utilizan para construir un gráfico de tipos de sistemas ponderados bipartitos, que luego se analiza mediante indicadores de análisis de red ampliamente conocidos en el campo de análisis de red (social), pero algo generalizado. Observamos que hasta ahora no se ha propuesto dicho enfoque para el análisis de datos TREC. El análisis muestra que, con las medidas actuales, un sistema que quiere ser efectivo en TREC debe ser efectivo en temas fáciles. Además, se sugiere que un análisis de clúster sobre la similitud del tema puede conducir a depender de un menor número de temas. Nuestro método de análisis, como se describe en este documento, se puede aplicar solo un posteriori, es decir, una vez que tengamos todos los temas y todos los sistemas disponibles. Agregar (eliminar) un nuevo sistema / tema significaría volver a competir con los indicadores de Hubness e Autoridad. Además, no estamos proponiendo explícitamente un cambio en la metodología de TREC actual, aunque esto podría ser un subproducto de estos análisis y más. Este es un trabajo inicial, y podrían realizarse análisis adicionales. Por ejemplo, se podrían usar otras métricas de efectividad, en lugar de AP. Se podrían calcular otros indicadores de centralidad, ampliamente utilizados en el análisis de redes sociales, aunque probablemente con resultados similares a PageRank. Sería interesante calcular los vectores propios de orden superior de A y AAT. El mismo tipo de análisis podría realizarse a nivel de documento, midiendo la facilidad del documento. Con suerte, los análisis adicionales del gráfico definidos en este documento, según el enfoque descrito, pueden ser perspicaces para una mejor comprensión de TREC o datos similares.

        "The second normalization removes the influence of the single system effectiveness on topic ease: by subtracting from each AP(si, tj) the MAP(si) value, we obtain normalized AP values (APM(si, tj), Normalized AP according to MAP): APM(si, tj) = AP(si, tj) − MAP(si), (4) that depend on topic ease only (the value will increase only if the topic is easy, i.e., all systems perform well on that topic).",

        "Now, if, for example, APA(s1, t2) > APA(s1, t1), we can infer that s1 is a good system on t2 and a bad system on t1 (see Tab. 2c).",
        "Vice versa, APM avoids Problem 2: APM(s, t) values measure the ease of topic t according to system s, normalized according to goodness of the system (good systems will not lead to higher APM values).",
        "If, for example, APM(s2, t1) > APM(s1, t1), we can infer that t1 is considered easier by s2 than by s1 (see Tab. 2d).",
        "On the basis of Tables 2a and 2b, we can also define two new measures of system effectiveness and topic ease, i.e., a Normalized MAP (MAP), obtained by averaging the APA values on one row in Tab. 2a, and a Normalized AAP (AAP), obtained by averaging the APM values on one column in Tab. 2b: MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 APA(si, tj) (5) AAP(tj) = 1 m mX i=1 APM(si, tj). (6) Thus, overall system performance can be measured, besides by means of MAP, also by means of MAP.",

        "The two Tables 2a and 2b are interesting per se, and can be analyzed in several different ways.",
        "In the following we propose an analysis based on network analysis techniques, mainly Kleinbergs HITS algorithm.",
        "There is a little further discussion of these normalizations in Sect. 6. 3.4 3rd step: Systems-Topics Graph The two tables 2a and 2b can be merged into a single one with the procedure shown in Fig. 1.",
        "The obtained matrix can be interpreted as the adjacency matrix of a complete weighted bipartite graph, that we call Systems-Topics graph.",
        "Arcs and weights in the graph can be interpreted as follows: • (weight on) arc s → t: how much the system s thinks that the topic t is easy - assuming that a system has no knowledge of the other systems (or in other words, how easy we might think the topic is, knowing only the results for this one system).",
        "This corresponds to APM values, i.e., to normalized topic ease (Fig. 2a). • (weight on) arc s ← t: how much the topic t thinks that the system s is good - assuming that a topic has no knowledge of the other topics (or in other words, how good we might think the system is, knowing only the results for this one topic).",
        "This corresponds to APA (normalized system effectiveness, Fig. 2b).",
        "Figs. 2c and 2d show the Systems-Topics complete weighted bipartite graph, on a toy example with 4 systems and 2 topics; the graph is split in two parts to have an understandable graphical representation: arcs in Fig. 2c are labeled with APM values; arcs in Fig. 2d are labeled with APA values. 4.",
        "ANALYSIS OF THE GRAPH 4.1 Weighted Inlinks, Outlinks, PageRank The sum of weighted outlinks, i.e., the sum of the weights on the outgoing arcs from each node, is always zero: • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a system s (Fig. 2c) is the sum of all the corresponding APM values on one row of the matrix in Tab. 2b. • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a topic t (Fig. 2d) is the sum of all the corresponding APA (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 2: The relationships between systems and topics (a) and (b); and the Systems-Topics graph for a toy example (c) and (d).",
        "Dashed arcs correspond to negative values. h (a) s1 ... sm t1 ... tn = s1 · · · sm t1 · · · tn s1 ... 0 APM (APA) sm t1 ... APA T 0 tn (APM T ) · a (h) s1 ... sm t1 ... tn Figure 3: Hub and Authority computation values on one row of the transpose of the matrix in Tab. 2a.",
        "The average1 of weighted inlinks is: • MAP for each node corresponding to a system s; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APA values on one column of the APA T part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1). • AAP for each node corresponding to a topic t; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APM values on one column of the APM part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1).",
        "Therefore, weighted inlinks measure either system effectiveness or topic ease; weighted outlinks are not meaningful.",
        "We could also apply the PageRank algorithm to the network; the meaning of the PageRank of a node is not quite so obvious as Inlinks and Outlinks, but it also seems a sensible measure of either system effectiveness or topic ease: if a system is effective, it will have several incoming links with high 1 Usually, the sum of the weights on the incoming arcs to each node is used in place of the average; since the graph is complete, it makes no difference. weights (APA); if a topic is easy it will have high weights (APM) on the incoming links too.",
        "We will see experimental confirmation in the following. 4.2 Hubs and Authorities Let us now turn to more sophisticated indicators.",
        "Kleinbergs HITS algorithm defines, for a directed graph, two indicators: hubness and authority; we reiterate here some of the basic details of the HITS algorithm in order to emphasize both the nature of our generalization and the interpretation of the HITS concepts in this context.",
        "Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs.",
        "As it is well known, an equivalent formulation in linear algebra terms is (see also Fig. 3): h = Aa and a = AT h (7) (where h is the hubness vector, with the hub values for all the nodes; a is the authority vector; A is the adjacency matrix of the graph; and AT its transpose).",
        "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
        "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
        "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",
        "Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.",
        "And, also, a good unhub links positively good unauthorities and negatively good authorities; a good unauthority is linked positively from good unhubs and negatively from good hubs.",
        "Let us now apply generalized HITS to our Systems-Topics graph.",
        "We compute a(s), h(s), a(t), and h(t).",
        "Intuitively, we expect that a(s) is somehow similar to Inlinks, so it should be a measure of either systems effectiveness or topic ease.",
        "Similarly, hubness should be more similar to Outlinks, thus less meaningful, although the interplay between hub and authority might lead to the discovery of something different.",
        "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",
        "Thus the two graphs in Figs. 2c and 2d can be analyzed independently.",
        "In fact the entire HITS analysis could be done in one direction only, with just APM(s, t) values or alternatively with just APA(s, t).",
        "As discussed below, probably most interest resides in the hubness of topics and the authority of systems, so the latter makes sense.",
        "However, in this paper, we pursue both analyses together, because the symmetry itself is interesting.",
        "Considering Fig. 2c we can state that: • Authority a(t) of a topic node t increases when: - if h(si) > 0, APM(si, t) increases (or if APM(si, t) > 0, h(si) increases); - if h(si) < 0, APM(si, t) decreases (or if APM(si, t) < 0, h(si) decreases). • Hubness h(s) of a system node s increases when: - if a(tj) > 0, APM(s, tj) increases (or, if APM(s, tj) > 0, a(tj) increases); - if a(tj) < 0, APM(s, tj) decreases (or, if APM(s, tj) < 0, a(tj) decreases).",
        "We can summarize this as: a(t) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those systems with high h(s); h(s) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those topics with high a(t).",
        "Intuitively, authority a(t) of a topic measures topic ease; hubness h(s) of a system measures systems capability to recognize easy topics.",
        "A system with high unhubness (negative hubness) would tend to regard easy topics as hard and hard ones as easy.",
        "The situation for Fig. 2d, i.e., for a(s) and h(t), is analogous.",
        "Authority a(s) of a system node s measures system effectiveness: it increases with the weight on the arc (i.e., APA(s, tj)) and the hubness of the incoming topic nodes tj.",
        "Hubness h(t) of a topic node t measures topic capability to recognize effective systems: if h(t) > 0, it increases further if APA(s, tj) increases; if h(t) < 0, it increases if APA(s, tj) decreases.",
        "Intuitively, we can state that A system has a higher authority if it is more effective on topics with high hubness; and A topic has a higher hubness if it is easier for those systems which are more effective in general.",
        "Conversely for system hubness and topic authority: A topic has a higher authority if it is easier on systems with high hubness; and A system has a higher hubness if it is more effective for those topics which are easier in general.",
        "Therefore, for each system we have two indicators: authority (a(s)), measuring system effectiveness, and hubness (h(s)), measuring system capability to estimate topic ease.",
        "And for each topic, we have two indicators: authority (a(t)), measuring topic ease, and hubness (h(t)), measuring topic capability to estimate systems effectiveness.",
        "We can define them formally as a(s) = X t h(t) · APA(s, t), h(t) = X s a(s) · APA(s, t), a(t) = X s h(s) · APM(s, t), h(s) = X t a(t) · APM(s, t).",
        "We observe that the hubness of topics may be of particular interest for evaluation studies.",
        "It may be that we can evaluate the effectiveness of systems efficiently by using relatively few high-hubness topics. 5.",
        "EXPERIMENTS We now turn to discuss if these indicators are meaningful and useful in practice, and how they correlate with standard measures used in TREC.",
        "We have built the Systems-Topics graph for TREC 8 data (featuring 1282 systems - actually, 2 Actually, TREC 8 data features 129 systems; due to some bug in our scripts, we did not include one system (8manexT3D1N0), but the results should not be affected. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 NAPM NAPA AP Figure 4: Distributions of AP, APA, and APM values in TREC 8 data MAP In PR H A MAP 1 1.0 1.0 .80 .99 Inlinks 1 1.0 .80 .99 PageRank 1 .80 .99 Hub 1 .87 (a) AAP In PR H A AAP 1 1.0 1.0 .92 1.0 Inlinks 1 1.0 .92 1.0 PageRank 1 .92 1.0 Hub 1 .93 (b) Table 3: Correlations between network analysis measures and MAP (a) and AAP (b) runs - on 50 topics).",
        "This section illustrates the results obtained mining these data according to the method presented in previous sections.",
        "Fig. 4 shows the distributions of AP, APA, and APM: whereas AP is very skewed, both APA and APM are much more symmetric (as it should be, since they are constructed by subtracting the mean).",
        "Tables 3a and 3b show the Pearsons correlation values between Inlinks, PageRank, Hub, Authority and, respectively, MAP or AAP (Outlinks values are not shown since they are always zero, as seen in Sect. 4).",
        "As expected, Inlinks and PageRank have a perfect correlation with MAP and AAP.",
        "Authority has a very high correlation too with MAP and AAP; Hub assumes slightly lower values.",
        "Let us analyze the correlations more in detail.",
        "The correlations chart in Figs. 5a and 5b demonstrate the high correlation between Authority and MAP or AAP.",
        "Hubness presents interesting phenomena: both Fig. 5c (correlation with MAP) and Fig. 5d (correlation with AAP) show that correlation is not exact, but neither is it random.",
        "This, given the meaning of hubness (capability in estimating topic ease and system effectiveness), means two things: (i) more effective systems are better at estimating topic ease; and (ii) easier topics are better at estimating system effectiveness.",
        "Whereas the first statement is fine (there is nothing against it), the second is a bit worrying.",
        "It means that system effectiveness in TREC is affected more by easy topics than by difficult topics, which is rather undesirable for quite obvious reasons: a system capable of performing well on a difficult topic, i.e., on a topic on which the other systems perform badly, would be an important result for IR effectiveness; con-8E-5 -6E-5 -4E-5 -2E-5 0E+0 2E-5 4E-5 6E-5 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 -3E-1 -2E-1 -1E-1 0E+0 1E-1 2E-1 3E-1 4E-1 5E-1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 (a) (b) 0E+0 2E-2 4E-2 6E-2 8E-2 1E-1 1E-1 1E-1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0E+0 1E-5 2E-5 3E-5 4E-5 5E-5 6E-5 7E-5 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 (c) (d) Figure 5: Correlations: MAP (x axis) and authority (y axis) of systems (a); AAP and authority of topics (b); MAP and hub of systems (c) and AAP and hub of topics (d) versely, a system capable of performing well on easy topics is just a confirmation of the state of the art.",
        "Indeed, the correlation between hubness and AAP (statement (i) above) is higher than the correlation between hubness and MAP (corresponding to statement (ii)): 0.92 vs. 0.80.",
        "However, this phenomenon is quite strong.",
        "This is also confirmed by the work being done on the TREC Robust Track [14].",
        "In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).",
        "The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8].",
        "GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82.",
        "To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001).",
        "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
        "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
        "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
        "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
        "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
        "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
        "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
        "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
        "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
        "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
        "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
        "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
        "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
        "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
        "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
        "This is not the case.",
        "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
        "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
        "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
        "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
        "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
        "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
        "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
        "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
        "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
        "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
        "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
        "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
        "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
        "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
        "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
        "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
        "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
        "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
        "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
        "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
        "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
        "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
        "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
        "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
        "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
        "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
        "GMAP is more balanced.",
        "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
        "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
        "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
        "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
        "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
        "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
        "This is left for future work. 7.",
        "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
        "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
        "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
        "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
        "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
        "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
        "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
        "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
        "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
        "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
        "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
        "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
        "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
        "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",
        "Hopefully, further analyses of the graph defined in this paper, according to the approach described, can be insightful for a better understanding of TREC or similar data.",

                "One possible direction from this point would be to attempt direct identification of such small sets of topics.",
                "However, in the present paper, we seek instead to explore the relationships suggested by the hypotheses, between what different topics tell us about systems and what different systems tell us about topics.",
                "We seek methods of building and analysing a matrix of system-topic normalised performances, with a view to giving insight into the issue and confirming or refuting the third and fourth hypotheses.",

                "THE IDEA 3.1 1st step: average precision table From TREC results, one can produce an Average Precision (AP) table (see Tab. 1a): each AP(si, tj) value measures the AP of system si on topic tj.",
                "Besides AP values, the table shows Mean Average Precision (MAP) values i.e., the mean of the AP values for a single system over all topics, and what we call Average Average Precision (AAP) values i.e., the average of the AP values for a single topic over all systems: MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 AP(si, tj), (1) AAP(tj) = 1 m mX i=1 AP(si, tj). (2) MAPs are indicators of systems performance: higher MAP means good system.",
                "AAP are indicators of the performance on a topic: higher AAP means easy topic - a topic on which all or most systems have good performance. 3.2 Critique of pure AP MAP is a standard, well known, and widely used IR effectiveness measure.",
                "Single AP values are used too (e.g., in AP histograms).",
                "Topic difficulty is often discussed (e.g., in TREC Robust track [14]), although AAP values are not used and, to the best of our knowledge, have never been proposed (the median, not the average, of AP on a topic is used to produce TREC AP histograms [11]).",
                "However, the AP values in Tab. 1 present two limitations, which are symmetric in some respect: • Problem 1.",
                "They are not reliable to compare the effectiveness of a system on different topics, relative to the other systems.",
                "If, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s1, t2), can we infer that s1 is a good system (i.e., has a good performance) on t1 and a bad system on t2?",
                "The answer is no: t1 might be an easy topic (with high AAP) and t2 a difficult one (low AAP).",
                "See an example in Tab. 1b: s1 is outperformed (on average) by the other systems on t1, and it outperforms the other systems on t2. • Problem 2.",
                "Conversely, if, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s2, t1), can we infer that t1 is considered easier by s1 than by s2?",
                "No, we cannot: s1 might be a good system (with high MAP) and s2 a bad one (low MAP); see an example in Tab. 1b.",
                "These two problems are a sort of breakdown of the well known high influence of topics on <br>ir evaluation</br>; again, our formulation makes explicit the topics / systems symmetry. 3.3 2nd step: normalizations To avoid these two problems, we can normalize the AP table in two ways.",
                "The first normalization removes the influence of the single topic ease on system performance.",
                "Each AP(si, tj) value in the table depends on both system goodness and topic ease (the value will increase if a system is good and/or the topic is easy).",
                "By subtracting from each AP(si, tj) the AAP(tj) value, we obtain normalized AP values (APA(si, tj), Normalized AP according to AAP): APA(si, tj) = AP(si, tj) − AAP(tj), (3) that depend on system performance only (the value will increase only if system performance is good).",
                "See Tab. 2a.",
                "The second normalization removes the influence of the single system effectiveness on topic ease: by subtracting from each AP(si, tj) the MAP(si) value, we obtain normalized AP values (APM(si, tj), Normalized AP according to MAP): APM(si, tj) = AP(si, tj) − MAP(si), (4) that depend on topic ease only (the value will increase only if the topic is easy, i.e., all systems perform well on that topic).",
                "See Tab. 2b.",

                "Now, if, for example, APA(s1, t2) > APA(s1, t1), we can infer that s1 is a good system on t2 and a bad system on t1 (see Tab. 2c).",
                "Vice versa, APM avoids Problem 2: APM(s, t) values measure the ease of topic t according to system s, normalized according to goodness of the system (good systems will not lead to higher APM values).",
                "If, for example, APM(s2, t1) > APM(s1, t1), we can infer that t1 is considered easier by s2 than by s1 (see Tab. 2d).",
                "On the basis of Tables 2a and 2b, we can also define two new measures of system effectiveness and topic ease, i.e., a Normalized MAP (MAP), obtained by averaging the APA values on one row in Tab. 2a, and a Normalized AAP (AAP), obtained by averaging the APM values on one column in Tab. 2b: MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 APA(si, tj) (5) AAP(tj) = 1 m mX i=1 APM(si, tj). (6) Thus, overall system performance can be measured, besides by means of MAP, also by means of MAP.",
                "Moreover, MAP is equivalent to MAP, as can be immediately proved by using Eqs. (5), (3), and (1): MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 (AP(si, tj) − AAP(tj)) = = MAP(si) − 1 n nX j=1 AAP(tj) (and 1 n Pn j=1 AAP(tj) is the same for all systems).",

                "The two Tables 2a and 2b are interesting per se, and can be analyzed in several different ways.",
                "In the following we propose an analysis based on network analysis techniques, mainly Kleinbergs HITS algorithm.",
                "There is a little further discussion of these normalizations in Sect. 6. 3.4 3rd step: Systems-Topics Graph The two tables 2a and 2b can be merged into a single one with the procedure shown in Fig. 1.",
                "The obtained matrix can be interpreted as the adjacency matrix of a complete weighted bipartite graph, that we call Systems-Topics graph.",
                "Arcs and weights in the graph can be interpreted as follows: • (weight on) arc s → t: how much the system s thinks that the topic t is easy - assuming that a system has no knowledge of the other systems (or in other words, how easy we might think the topic is, knowing only the results for this one system).",
                "This corresponds to APM values, i.e., to normalized topic ease (Fig. 2a). • (weight on) arc s ← t: how much the topic t thinks that the system s is good - assuming that a topic has no knowledge of the other topics (or in other words, how good we might think the system is, knowing only the results for this one topic).",
                "This corresponds to APA (normalized system effectiveness, Fig. 2b).",
                "Figs. 2c and 2d show the Systems-Topics complete weighted bipartite graph, on a toy example with 4 systems and 2 topics; the graph is split in two parts to have an understandable graphical representation: arcs in Fig. 2c are labeled with APM values; arcs in Fig. 2d are labeled with APA values. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS OF THE GRAPH 4.1 Weighted Inlinks, Outlinks, PageRank The sum of weighted outlinks, i.e., the sum of the weights on the outgoing arcs from each node, is always zero: • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a system s (Fig. 2c) is the sum of all the corresponding APM values on one row of the matrix in Tab. 2b. • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a topic t (Fig. 2d) is the sum of all the corresponding APA (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 2: The relationships between systems and topics (a) and (b); and the Systems-Topics graph for a toy example (c) and (d).",
                "Dashed arcs correspond to negative values. h (a) s1 ... sm t1 ... tn = s1 · · · sm t1 · · · tn s1 ... 0 APM (APA) sm t1 ... APA T 0 tn (APM T ) · a (h) s1 ... sm t1 ... tn Figure 3: Hub and Authority computation values on one row of the transpose of the matrix in Tab. 2a.",
                "The average1 of weighted inlinks is: • MAP for each node corresponding to a system s; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APA values on one column of the APA T part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1). • AAP for each node corresponding to a topic t; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APM values on one column of the APM part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1).",
                "Therefore, weighted inlinks measure either system effectiveness or topic ease; weighted outlinks are not meaningful.",
                "We could also apply the PageRank algorithm to the network; the meaning of the PageRank of a node is not quite so obvious as Inlinks and Outlinks, but it also seems a sensible measure of either system effectiveness or topic ease: if a system is effective, it will have several incoming links with high 1 Usually, the sum of the weights on the incoming arcs to each node is used in place of the average; since the graph is complete, it makes no difference. weights (APA); if a topic is easy it will have high weights (APM) on the incoming links too.",
                "We will see experimental confirmation in the following. 4.2 Hubs and Authorities Let us now turn to more sophisticated indicators.",
                "Kleinbergs HITS algorithm defines, for a directed graph, two indicators: hubness and authority; we reiterate here some of the basic details of the HITS algorithm in order to emphasize both the nature of our generalization and the interpretation of the HITS concepts in this context.",
                "Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs.",
                "As it is well known, an equivalent formulation in linear algebra terms is (see also Fig. 3): h = Aa and a = AT h (7) (where h is the hubness vector, with the hub values for all the nodes; a is the authority vector; A is the adjacency matrix of the graph; and AT its transpose).",
                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",
                "Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.",
                "And, also, a good unhub links positively good unauthorities and negatively good authorities; a good unauthority is linked positively from good unhubs and negatively from good hubs.",
                "Let us now apply generalized HITS to our Systems-Topics graph.",
                "We compute a(s), h(s), a(t), and h(t).",
                "Intuitively, we expect that a(s) is somehow similar to Inlinks, so it should be a measure of either systems effectiveness or topic ease.",
                "Similarly, hubness should be more similar to Outlinks, thus less meaningful, although the interplay between hub and authority might lead to the discovery of something different.",
                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",
                "Thus the two graphs in Figs. 2c and 2d can be analyzed independently.",
                "In fact the entire HITS analysis could be done in one direction only, with just APM(s, t) values or alternatively with just APA(s, t).",
                "As discussed below, probably most interest resides in the hubness of topics and the authority of systems, so the latter makes sense.",
                "However, in this paper, we pursue both analyses together, because the symmetry itself is interesting.",
                "Considering Fig. 2c we can state that: • Authority a(t) of a topic node t increases when: - if h(si) > 0, APM(si, t) increases (or if APM(si, t) > 0, h(si) increases); - if h(si) < 0, APM(si, t) decreases (or if APM(si, t) < 0, h(si) decreases). • Hubness h(s) of a system node s increases when: - if a(tj) > 0, APM(s, tj) increases (or, if APM(s, tj) > 0, a(tj) increases); - if a(tj) < 0, APM(s, tj) decreases (or, if APM(s, tj) < 0, a(tj) decreases).",
                "We can summarize this as: a(t) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those systems with high h(s); h(s) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those topics with high a(t).",

                "Authority a(s) of a system node s measures system effectiveness: it increases with the weight on the arc (i.e., APA(s, tj)) and the hubness of the incoming topic nodes tj.",
                "Hubness h(t) of a topic node t measures topic capability to recognize effective systems: if h(t) > 0, it increases further if APA(s, tj) increases; if h(t) < 0, it increases if APA(s, tj) decreases.",
                "Intuitively, we can state that A system has a higher authority if it is more effective on topics with high hubness; and A topic has a higher hubness if it is easier for those systems which are more effective in general.",
                "Conversely for system hubness and topic authority: A topic has a higher authority if it is easier on systems with high hubness; and A system has a higher hubness if it is more effective for those topics which are easier in general.",
                "Therefore, for each system we have two indicators: authority (a(s)), measuring system effectiveness, and hubness (h(s)), measuring system capability to estimate topic ease.",

                "Fig. 4 shows the distributions of AP, APA, and APM: whereas AP is very skewed, both APA and APM are much more symmetric (as it should be, since they are constructed by subtracting the mean).",
                "Tables 3a and 3b show the Pearsons correlation values between Inlinks, PageRank, Hub, Authority and, respectively, MAP or AAP (Outlinks values are not shown since they are always zero, as seen in Sect. 4).",
                "As expected, Inlinks and PageRank have a perfect correlation with MAP and AAP.",

                "Indeed, the correlation between hubness and AAP (statement (i) above) is higher than the correlation between hubness and MAP (corresponding to statement (ii)): 0.92 vs. 0.80.",
                "However, this phenomenon is quite strong.",
                "This is also confirmed by the work being done on the TREC Robust Track [14].",
                "In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).",
                "The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8].",
                "GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82.",
                "To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001).",
                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",
                "Hopefully, further analyses of the graph defined in this paper, according to the approach described, can be insightful for a better understanding of TREC or similar data.",

                "One possible direction from this point would be to attempt direct identification of such small sets of topics.",
                "However, in the present paper, we seek instead to explore the relationships suggested by the hypotheses, between what different topics tell us about systems and what different systems tell us about topics.",
                "We seek methods of building and analysing a matrix of system-topic normalised performances, with a view to giving insight into the issue and confirming or refuting the third and fourth hypotheses.",
                "It turns out that the obvious symmetry implied by the above formulation of the hypotheses is a property worth investigating, and the investigation does indeed give us valuable insights. 3.",
                "THE IDEA 3.1 1st step: average precision table From TREC results, one can produce an Average Precision (AP) table (see Tab. 1a): each AP(si, tj) value measures the AP of system si on topic tj.",
                "Besides AP values, the table shows Mean Average Precision (MAP) values i.e., the mean of the AP values for a single system over all topics, and what we call Average Average Precision (AAP) values i.e., the average of the AP values for a single topic over all systems: MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 AP(si, tj), (1) AAP(tj) = 1 m mX i=1 AP(si, tj). (2) MAPs are indicators of systems performance: higher MAP means good system.",
                "AAP are indicators of the performance on a topic: higher AAP means easy topic - a topic on which all or most systems have good performance. 3.2 Critique of pure AP MAP is a standard, well known, and widely used IR effectiveness measure.",
                "Single AP values are used too (e.g., in AP histograms).",
                "Topic difficulty is often discussed (e.g., in TREC Robust track [14]), although AAP values are not used and, to the best of our knowledge, have never been proposed (the median, not the average, of AP on a topic is used to produce TREC AP histograms [11]).",
                "However, the AP values in Tab. 1 present two limitations, which are symmetric in some respect: • Problem 1.",
                "They are not reliable to compare the effectiveness of a system on different topics, relative to the other systems.",
                "If, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s1, t2), can we infer that s1 is a good system (i.e., has a good performance) on t1 and a bad system on t2?",
                "The answer is no: t1 might be an easy topic (with high AAP) and t2 a difficult one (low AAP).",
                "See an example in Tab. 1b: s1 is outperformed (on average) by the other systems on t1, and it outperforms the other systems on t2. • Problem 2.",
                "Conversely, if, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s2, t1), can we infer that t1 is considered easier by s1 than by s2?",
                "No, we cannot: s1 might be a good system (with high MAP) and s2 a bad one (low MAP); see an example in Tab. 1b.",
                "These two problems are a sort of breakdown of the well known high influence of topics on IR evaluation; again, our formulation makes explicit the topics / systems symmetry. 3.3 2nd step: normalizations To avoid these two problems, we can normalize the AP table in two ways.",
                "The first normalization removes the influence of the single topic ease on system performance.",
                "Each AP(si, tj) value in the table depends on both system goodness and topic ease (the value will increase if a system is good and/or the topic is easy).",
                "By subtracting from each AP(si, tj) the AAP(tj) value, we obtain normalized AP values (APA(si, tj), Normalized AP according to AAP): APA(si, tj) = AP(si, tj) − AAP(tj), (3) that depend on system performance only (the value will increase only if system performance is good).",
                "See Tab. 2a.",
                "The second normalization removes the influence of the single system effectiveness on topic ease: by subtracting from each AP(si, tj) the MAP(si) value, we obtain normalized AP values (APM(si, tj), Normalized AP according to MAP): APM(si, tj) = AP(si, tj) − MAP(si), (4) that depend on topic ease only (the value will increase only if the topic is easy, i.e., all systems perform well on that topic).",
                "See Tab. 2b.",
                "In other words, APA avoids Problem 1: APA(s, t) values measure the performance of system s on topic t normalized t1 · · · tn MAP s1 APA(s1, t1) · · · APA(s1, tn) MAP(s1) ... ... ... sm APA(sm, t1) · · · APA(sm, tn) MAP(sm) 0 · · · 0 0 (a) t1 · · · tn s1 APM(s1, t1) · · · APM(s1, tn) 0 ... ... ... sm APM(sm, t1) · · · APM(sm, tn) 0 AAP AAP(t1) · · · AAP(tn) 0 (b) t1 t2 · · · MAP s1 −0.1 0.1 · · · . . . s2 0.2 · · · · · · . . . ... ... ... 0 0 · · · t1 t2 · · · s1 −0.1 −0.2 · · · 0 s2 0.1 · · · · · · 0 ... ... ...

                "Now, if, for example, APA(s1, t2) > APA(s1, t1), we can infer that s1 is a good system on t2 and a bad system on t1 (see Tab. 2c).",
                "Vice versa, APM avoids Problem 2: APM(s, t) values measure the ease of topic t according to system s, normalized according to goodness of the system (good systems will not lead to higher APM values).",
                "If, for example, APM(s2, t1) > APM(s1, t1), we can infer that t1 is considered easier by s2 than by s1 (see Tab. 2d).",
                "On the basis of Tables 2a and 2b, we can also define two new measures of system effectiveness and topic ease, i.e., a Normalized MAP (MAP), obtained by averaging the APA values on one row in Tab. 2a, and a Normalized AAP (AAP), obtained by averaging the APM values on one column in Tab. 2b: MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 APA(si, tj) (5) AAP(tj) = 1 m mX i=1 APM(si, tj). (6) Thus, overall system performance can be measured, besides by means of MAP, also by means of MAP.",
                "Moreover, MAP is equivalent to MAP, as can be immediately proved by using Eqs. (5), (3), and (1): MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 (AP(si, tj) − AAP(tj)) = = MAP(si) − 1 n nX j=1 AAP(tj) (and 1 n Pn j=1 AAP(tj) is the same for all systems).",

                "APA T is the transpose of APA. means of AAP, also by means of AAP, and this is equivalent (the proof is analogous, and relies on Eqs. (6), (4), and (2)).",
                "The two Tables 2a and 2b are interesting per se, and can be analyzed in several different ways.",
                "In the following we propose an analysis based on <br>network analysis</br> techniques, mainly Kleinbergs HITS algorithm.",
                "There is a little further discussion of these normalizations in Sect. 6. 3.4 3rd step: Systems-Topics Graph The two tables 2a and 2b can be merged into a single one with the procedure shown in Fig. 1.",
                "The obtained matrix can be interpreted as the adjacency matrix of a complete weighted bipartite graph, that we call Systems-Topics graph.",
                "Arcs and weights in the graph can be interpreted as follows: • (weight on) arc s → t: how much the system s thinks that the topic t is easy - assuming that a system has no knowledge of the other systems (or in other words, how easy we might think the topic is, knowing only the results for this one system).",
                "This corresponds to APM values, i.e., to normalized topic ease (Fig. 2a). • (weight on) arc s ← t: how much the topic t thinks that the system s is good - assuming that a topic has no knowledge of the other topics (or in other words, how good we might think the system is, knowing only the results for this one topic).",
                "This corresponds to APA (normalized system effectiveness, Fig. 2b).",
                "Figs. 2c and 2d show the Systems-Topics complete weighted bipartite graph, on a toy example with 4 systems and 2 topics; the graph is split in two parts to have an understandable graphical representation: arcs in Fig. 2c are labeled with APM values; arcs in Fig. 2d are labeled with APA values. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS OF THE GRAPH 4.1 Weighted Inlinks, Outlinks, PageRank The sum of weighted outlinks, i.e., the sum of the weights on the outgoing arcs from each node, is always zero: • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a system s (Fig. 2c) is the sum of all the corresponding APM values on one row of the matrix in Tab. 2b. • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a topic t (Fig. 2d) is the sum of all the corresponding APA (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 2: The relationships between systems and topics (a) and (b); and the Systems-Topics graph for a toy example (c) and (d).",
                "Dashed arcs correspond to negative values. h (a) s1 ... sm t1 ... tn = s1 · · · sm t1 · · · tn s1 ... 0 APM (APA) sm t1 ... APA T 0 tn (APM T ) · a (h) s1 ... sm t1 ... tn Figure 3: Hub and Authority computation values on one row of the transpose of the matrix in Tab. 2a.",
                "The average1 of weighted inlinks is: • MAP for each node corresponding to a system s; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APA values on one column of the APA T part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1). • AAP for each node corresponding to a topic t; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APM values on one column of the APM part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1).",
                "Therefore, weighted inlinks measure either system effectiveness or topic ease; weighted outlinks are not meaningful.",
                "We could also apply the PageRank algorithm to the network; the meaning of the PageRank of a node is not quite so obvious as Inlinks and Outlinks, but it also seems a sensible measure of either system effectiveness or topic ease: if a system is effective, it will have several incoming links with high 1 Usually, the sum of the weights on the incoming arcs to each node is used in place of the average; since the graph is complete, it makes no difference. weights (APA); if a topic is easy it will have high weights (APM) on the incoming links too.",
                "We will see experimental confirmation in the following. 4.2 Hubs and Authorities Let us now turn to more sophisticated indicators.",
                "Kleinbergs HITS algorithm defines, for a directed graph, two indicators: hubness and authority; we reiterate here some of the basic details of the HITS algorithm in order to emphasize both the nature of our generalization and the interpretation of the HITS concepts in this context.",
                "Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs.",
                "As it is well known, an equivalent formulation in linear algebra terms is (see also Fig. 3): h = Aa and a = AT h (7) (where h is the hubness vector, with the hub values for all the nodes; a is the authority vector; A is the adjacency matrix of the graph; and AT its transpose).",
                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",
                "Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.",
                "And, also, a good unhub links positively good unauthorities and negatively good authorities; a good unauthority is linked positively from good unhubs and negatively from good hubs.",
                "Let us now apply generalized HITS to our Systems-Topics graph.",
                "We compute a(s), h(s), a(t), and h(t).",
                "Intuitively, we expect that a(s) is somehow similar to Inlinks, so it should be a measure of either systems effectiveness or topic ease.",
                "Similarly, hubness should be more similar to Outlinks, thus less meaningful, although the interplay between hub and authority might lead to the discovery of something different.",
                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",
                "Thus the two graphs in Figs. 2c and 2d can be analyzed independently.",
                "In fact the entire HITS analysis could be done in one direction only, with just APM(s, t) values or alternatively with just APA(s, t).",
                "As discussed below, probably most interest resides in the hubness of topics and the authority of systems, so the latter makes sense.",
                "However, in this paper, we pursue both analyses together, because the symmetry itself is interesting.",
                "Considering Fig. 2c we can state that: • Authority a(t) of a topic node t increases when: - if h(si) > 0, APM(si, t) increases (or if APM(si, t) > 0, h(si) increases); - if h(si) < 0, APM(si, t) decreases (or if APM(si, t) < 0, h(si) decreases). • Hubness h(s) of a system node s increases when: - if a(tj) > 0, APM(s, tj) increases (or, if APM(s, tj) > 0, a(tj) increases); - if a(tj) < 0, APM(s, tj) decreases (or, if APM(s, tj) < 0, a(tj) decreases).",
                "We can summarize this as: a(t) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those systems with high h(s); h(s) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those topics with high a(t).",
                "Intuitively, authority a(t) of a topic measures topic ease; hubness h(s) of a system measures systems capability to recognize easy topics.",
                "A system with high unhubness (negative hubness) would tend to regard easy topics as hard and hard ones as easy.",
                "The situation for Fig. 2d, i.e., for a(s) and h(t), is analogous.",
                "Authority a(s) of a system node s measures system effectiveness: it increases with the weight on the arc (i.e., APA(s, tj)) and the hubness of the incoming topic nodes tj.",
                "Hubness h(t) of a topic node t measures topic capability to recognize effective systems: if h(t) > 0, it increases further if APA(s, tj) increases; if h(t) < 0, it increases if APA(s, tj) decreases.",
                "Intuitively, we can state that A system has a higher authority if it is more effective on topics with high hubness; and A topic has a higher hubness if it is easier for those systems which are more effective in general.",
                "Conversely for system hubness and topic authority: A topic has a higher authority if it is easier on systems with high hubness; and A system has a higher hubness if it is more effective for those topics which are easier in general.",
                "Therefore, for each system we have two indicators: authority (a(s)), measuring system effectiveness, and hubness (h(s)), measuring system capability to estimate topic ease.",
                "And for each topic, we have two indicators: authority (a(t)), measuring topic ease, and hubness (h(t)), measuring topic capability to estimate systems effectiveness.",
                "We can define them formally as a(s) = X t h(t) · APA(s, t), h(t) = X s a(s) · APA(s, t), a(t) = X s h(s) · APM(s, t), h(s) = X t a(t) · APM(s, t).",
                "We observe that the hubness of topics may be of particular interest for evaluation studies.",
                "It may be that we can evaluate the effectiveness of systems efficiently by using relatively few high-hubness topics. 5.",

                "This, given the meaning of hubness (capability in estimating topic ease and system effectiveness), means two things: (i) more effective systems are better at estimating topic ease; and (ii) easier topics are better at estimating system effectiveness.",
                "Whereas the first statement is fine (there is nothing against it), the second is a bit worrying.",
                "It means that system effectiveness in TREC is affected more by easy topics than by difficult topics, which is rather undesirable for quite obvious reasons: a system capable of performing well on a difficult topic, i.e., on a topic on which the other systems perform badly, would be an important result for IR effectiveness; con-8E-5 -6E-5 -4E-5 -2E-5 0E+0 2E-5 4E-5 6E-5 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 -3E-1 -2E-1 -1E-1 0E+0 1E-1 2E-1 3E-1 4E-1 5E-1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 (a) (b) 0E+0 2E-2 4E-2 6E-2 8E-2 1E-1 1E-1 1E-1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0E+0 1E-5 2E-5 3E-5 4E-5 5E-5 6E-5 7E-5 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 (c) (d) Figure 5: Correlations: MAP (x axis) and authority (y axis) of systems (a); AAP and authority of topics (b); MAP and hub of systems (c) and AAP and hub of topics (d) versely, a system capable of performing well on easy topics is just a confirmation of the state of the art.",
                "Indeed, the correlation between hubness and AAP (statement (i) above) is higher than the correlation between hubness and MAP (corresponding to statement (ii)): 0.92 vs. 0.80.",
                "However, this phenomenon is quite strong.",
                "This is also confirmed by the work being done on the TREC Robust Track [14].",
                "In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).",
                "The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8].",
                "GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82.",
                "To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001).",
                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of <br>network analysis</br> indicators widely known in the (social) <br>network analysis</br> field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social <br>network analysis</br>, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",
                "Hopefully, further analyses of the graph defined in this paper, according to the approach described, can be insightful for a better understanding of TREC or similar data.",

                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",
                "Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.",

                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",
                "Thus the two graphs in Figs. 2c and 2d can be analyzed independently.",

                "Considering Fig. 2c we can state that: • Authority a(t) of a topic node t increases when: - if h(si) > 0, APM(si, t) increases (or if APM(si, t) > 0, h(si) increases); - if h(si) < 0, APM(si, t) decreases (or if APM(si, t) < 0, h(si) decreases). • Hubness h(s) of a system node s increases when: - if a(tj) > 0, APM(s, tj) increases (or, if APM(s, tj) > 0, a(tj) increases); - if a(tj) < 0, APM(s, tj) decreases (or, if APM(s, tj) < 0, a(tj) decreases).",

                "Authority a(s) of a system node s measures system effectiveness: it increases with the weight on the arc (i.e., APA(s, tj)) and the hubness of the incoming topic nodes tj.",

                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that <br>trec</br> effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in <br>trec</br>.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that <br>trec</br> results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in <br>trec</br> results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in <br>trec</br> pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of <br>trec</br> results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse <br>trec</br> data; • the method applied on <br>trec</br> data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in <br>trec</br>, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to <br>trec</br> data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in <br>trec</br> needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current <br>trec</br> methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",
                "Hopefully, further analyses of the graph defined in this paper, according to the approach described, can be insightful for a better understanding of <br>trec</br> or similar data.",

                "However, in the present paper, we seek instead to explore the relationships suggested by the hypotheses, between what different topics tell us about systems and what different systems tell us about topics.",

                "THE IDEA 3.1 1st step: average precision table From TREC results, one can produce an Average Precision (AP) table (see Tab. 1a): each AP(si, tj) value measures the AP of system si on topic tj.",
                "Besides AP values, the table shows Mean Average Precision (MAP) values i.e., the mean of the AP values for a single system over all topics, and what we call Average Average Precision (AAP) values i.e., the average of the AP values for a single topic over all systems: MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 AP(si, tj), (1) AAP(tj) = 1 m mX i=1 AP(si, tj). (2) MAPs are indicators of systems performance: higher MAP means good system.",
                "AAP are indicators of the performance on a topic: higher AAP means easy topic - a topic on which all or most systems have good performance. 3.2 Critique of pure AP MAP is a standard, well known, and widely used IR effectiveness measure.",
                "Single AP values are used too (e.g., in AP histograms).",
                "Topic difficulty is often discussed (e.g., in TREC Robust track [14]), although AAP values are not used and, to the best of our knowledge, have never been proposed (the median, not the average, of AP on a topic is used to produce TREC AP histograms [11]).",
                "However, the AP values in Tab. 1 present two limitations, which are symmetric in some respect: • Problem 1.",
                "They are not reliable to compare the effectiveness of a system on different topics, relative to the other systems.",
                "If, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s1, t2), can we infer that s1 is a good system (i.e., has a good performance) on t1 and a bad system on t2?",
                "The answer is no: t1 might be an easy topic (with high AAP) and t2 a difficult one (low AAP).",
                "See an example in Tab. 1b: s1 is outperformed (on average) by the other systems on t1, and it outperforms the other systems on t2. • Problem 2.",
                "Conversely, if, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s2, t1), can we infer that t1 is considered easier by s1 than by s2?",
                "No, we cannot: s1 might be a good system (with high MAP) and s2 a bad one (low MAP); see an example in Tab. 1b.",
                "These two problems are a sort of breakdown of the well known high influence of topics on IR evaluation; again, our formulation makes explicit the topics / systems symmetry. 3.3 2nd step: normalizations To avoid these two problems, we can normalize the AP table in two ways.",
                "The first normalization removes the influence of the single topic ease on system performance.",
                "Each AP(si, tj) value in the table depends on both system goodness and topic ease (the value will increase if a system is good and/or the topic is easy).",
                "By subtracting from each AP(si, tj) the AAP(tj) value, we obtain normalized AP values (APA(si, tj), Normalized AP according to AAP): APA(si, tj) = AP(si, tj) − AAP(tj), (3) that depend on system performance only (the value will increase only if system performance is good).",
                "See Tab. 2a.",
                "The second normalization removes the influence of the single system effectiveness on topic ease: by subtracting from each AP(si, tj) the MAP(si) value, we obtain normalized AP values (APM(si, tj), Normalized AP according to MAP): APM(si, tj) = AP(si, tj) − MAP(si), (4) that depend on topic ease only (the value will increase only if the topic is easy, i.e., all systems perform well on that topic).",
                "See Tab. 2b.",

                "Now, if, for example, APA(s1, t2) > APA(s1, t1), we can infer that s1 is a good system on t2 and a bad system on t1 (see Tab. 2c).",
                "Vice versa, APM avoids Problem 2: APM(s, t) values measure the ease of topic t according to system s, normalized according to goodness of the system (good systems will not lead to higher APM values).",
                "If, for example, APM(s2, t1) > APM(s1, t1), we can infer that t1 is considered easier by s2 than by s1 (see Tab. 2d).",
                "On the basis of Tables 2a and 2b, we can also define two new measures of system effectiveness and topic ease, i.e., a Normalized MAP (MAP), obtained by averaging the APA values on one row in Tab. 2a, and a Normalized AAP (AAP), obtained by averaging the APM values on one column in Tab. 2b: MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 APA(si, tj) (5) AAP(tj) = 1 m mX i=1 APM(si, tj). (6) Thus, overall system performance can be measured, besides by means of MAP, also by means of MAP.",
                "Moreover, MAP is equivalent to MAP, as can be immediately proved by using Eqs. (5), (3), and (1): MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 (AP(si, tj) − AAP(tj)) = = MAP(si) − 1 n nX j=1 AAP(tj) (and 1 n Pn j=1 AAP(tj) is the same for all systems).",

                "APA T is the transpose of APA. means of AAP, also by means of AAP, and this is equivalent (the proof is analogous, and relies on Eqs. (6), (4), and (2)).",
                "The two Tables 2a and 2b are interesting per se, and can be analyzed in several different ways.",
                "In the following we propose an analysis based on network analysis techniques, mainly Kleinbergs HITS algorithm.",
                "There is a little further discussion of these normalizations in Sect. 6. 3.4 3rd step: Systems-Topics Graph The two tables 2a and 2b can be merged into a single one with the procedure shown in Fig. 1.",
                "The obtained matrix can be interpreted as the adjacency matrix of a complete weighted bipartite graph, that we call Systems-Topics graph.",
                "Arcs and weights in the graph can be interpreted as follows: • (weight on) arc s → t: how much the system s thinks that the topic t is easy - assuming that a system has no knowledge of the other systems (or in other words, how easy we might think the topic is, knowing only the results for this one system).",
                "This corresponds to APM values, i.e., to normalized topic ease (Fig. 2a). • (weight on) arc s ← t: how much the topic t thinks that the system s is good - assuming that a topic has no knowledge of the other topics (or in other words, how good we might think the system is, knowing only the results for this one topic).",
                "This corresponds to APA (normalized system effectiveness, Fig. 2b).",
                "Figs. 2c and 2d show the Systems-Topics complete weighted bipartite graph, on a toy example with 4 systems and 2 topics; the graph is split in two parts to have an understandable graphical representation: arcs in Fig. 2c are labeled with APM values; arcs in Fig. 2d are labeled with APA values. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS OF THE GRAPH 4.1 Weighted Inlinks, Outlinks, PageRank The sum of weighted outlinks, i.e., the sum of the weights on the outgoing arcs from each node, is always zero: • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a system s (Fig. 2c) is the sum of all the corresponding APM values on one row of the matrix in Tab. 2b. • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a topic t (Fig. 2d) is the sum of all the corresponding APA (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 2: The relationships between systems and topics (a) and (b); and the Systems-Topics graph for a toy example (c) and (d).",
                "Dashed arcs correspond to negative values. h (a) s1 ... sm t1 ... tn = s1 · · · sm t1 · · · tn s1 ... 0 APM (APA) sm t1 ... APA T 0 tn (APM T ) · a (h) s1 ... sm t1 ... tn Figure 3: Hub and Authority computation values on one row of the transpose of the matrix in Tab. 2a.",
                "The average1 of weighted inlinks is: • MAP for each node corresponding to a system s; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APA values on one column of the APA T part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1). • AAP for each node corresponding to a topic t; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APM values on one column of the APM part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1).",
                "Therefore, weighted inlinks measure either system effectiveness or topic ease; weighted outlinks are not meaningful.",
                "We could also apply the PageRank algorithm to the network; the meaning of the PageRank of a node is not quite so obvious as Inlinks and Outlinks, but it also seems a sensible measure of either system effectiveness or topic ease: if a system is effective, it will have several incoming links with high 1 Usually, the sum of the weights on the incoming arcs to each node is used in place of the average; since the graph is complete, it makes no difference. weights (APA); if a topic is easy it will have high weights (APM) on the incoming links too.",
                "We will see experimental confirmation in the following. 4.2 Hubs and Authorities Let us now turn to more sophisticated indicators.",
                "Kleinbergs HITS algorithm defines, for a directed graph, two indicators: hubness and authority; we reiterate here some of the basic details of the HITS algorithm in order to emphasize both the nature of our generalization and the interpretation of the HITS concepts in this context.",
                "Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs.",
                "As it is well known, an equivalent formulation in linear algebra terms is (see also Fig. 3): h = Aa and a = AT h (7) (where h is the hubness vector, with the hub values for all the nodes; a is the authority vector; A is the adjacency matrix of the graph; and AT its transpose).",
                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",
                "Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.",
                "And, also, a good unhub links positively good unauthorities and negatively good authorities; a good unauthority is linked positively from good unhubs and negatively from good hubs.",
                "Let us now apply generalized HITS to our Systems-Topics graph.",
                "We compute a(s), h(s), a(t), and h(t).",
                "Intuitively, we expect that a(s) is somehow similar to Inlinks, so it should be a measure of either systems effectiveness or topic ease.",
                "Similarly, hubness should be more similar to Outlinks, thus less meaningful, although the interplay between hub and authority might lead to the discovery of something different.",
                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",
                "Thus the two graphs in Figs. 2c and 2d can be analyzed independently.",
                "In fact the entire HITS analysis could be done in one direction only, with just APM(s, t) values or alternatively with just APA(s, t).",
                "As discussed below, probably most interest resides in the hubness of topics and the authority of systems, so the latter makes sense.",
                "However, in this paper, we pursue both analyses together, because the symmetry itself is interesting.",
                "Considering Fig. 2c we can state that: • Authority a(t) of a topic node t increases when: - if h(si) > 0, APM(si, t) increases (or if APM(si, t) > 0, h(si) increases); - if h(si) < 0, APM(si, t) decreases (or if APM(si, t) < 0, h(si) decreases). • Hubness h(s) of a system node s increases when: - if a(tj) > 0, APM(s, tj) increases (or, if APM(s, tj) > 0, a(tj) increases); - if a(tj) < 0, APM(s, tj) decreases (or, if APM(s, tj) < 0, a(tj) decreases).",
                "We can summarize this as: a(t) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those systems with high h(s); h(s) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those topics with high a(t).",
                "Intuitively, authority a(t) of a topic measures topic ease; hubness h(s) of a system measures systems capability to recognize easy topics.",
                "A system with high unhubness (negative hubness) would tend to regard easy topics as hard and hard ones as easy.",
                "The situation for Fig. 2d, i.e., for a(s) and h(t), is analogous.",
                "Authority a(s) of a system node s measures system effectiveness: it increases with the weight on the arc (i.e., APA(s, tj)) and the hubness of the incoming topic nodes tj.",
                "Hubness h(t) of a topic node t measures topic capability to recognize effective systems: if h(t) > 0, it increases further if APA(s, tj) increases; if h(t) < 0, it increases if APA(s, tj) decreases.",
                "Intuitively, we can state that A system has a higher authority if it is more effective on topics with high hubness; and A topic has a higher hubness if it is easier for those systems which are more effective in general.",
                "Conversely for system hubness and topic authority: A topic has a higher authority if it is easier on systems with high hubness; and A system has a higher hubness if it is more effective for those topics which are easier in general.",
                "Therefore, for each system we have two indicators: authority (a(s)), measuring system effectiveness, and hubness (h(s)), measuring system capability to estimate topic ease.",
                "And for each topic, we have two indicators: authority (a(t)), measuring topic ease, and hubness (h(t)), measuring topic capability to estimate systems effectiveness.",
                "We can define them formally as a(s) = X t h(t) · APA(s, t), h(t) = X s a(s) · APA(s, t), a(t) = X s h(s) · APM(s, t), h(s) = X t a(t) · APM(s, t).",
                "We observe that the hubness of topics may be of particular interest for evaluation studies.",

                "As expected, Inlinks and PageRank have a perfect correlation with MAP and AAP.",

                "Whereas the first statement is fine (there is nothing against it), the second is a bit worrying.",

                "Indeed, the correlation between hubness and AAP (statement (i) above) is higher than the correlation between hubness and MAP (corresponding to statement (ii)): 0.92 vs. 0.80.",
                "However, this phenomenon is quite strong.",
                "This is also confirmed by the work being done on the TREC Robust Track [14].",
                "In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).",
                "The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8].",
                "GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82.",
                "To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001).",
                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",
                "Hopefully, further analyses of the graph defined in this paper, according to the approach described, can be insightful for a better understanding of TREC or similar data.",

                "Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs.",

                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",
                "Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.",

                "Similarly, hubness should be more similar to Outlinks, thus less meaningful, although the interplay between hub and authority might lead to the discovery of something different.",
                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",

                "Authority a(s) of a system node s measures system effectiveness: it increases with the weight on the arc (i.e., APA(s, tj)) and the hubness of the incoming topic nodes tj.",

                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",
                "Hopefully, further analyses of the graph defined in this paper, according to the approach described, can be insightful for a better understanding of TREC or similar data.",

                "Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs.",

                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",

                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",

                "However, this phenomenon is quite strong.",
                "This is also confirmed by the work being done on the TREC Robust Track [14].",
                "In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).",
                "The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8].",
                "GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82.",
                "To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001).",
                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",

(2) MAPs are indicators of systems performance: higher MAP means good system.",

                "This corresponds to APM values, i.e., to normalized topic ease (Fig. 2a). • (weight on) arc s ← t: how much the topic t thinks that the system s is good - assuming that a topic has no knowledge of the other topics (or in other words, how good we might think the system is, knowing only the results for this one topic).",

                "Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs.",
                "As it is well known, an equivalent formulation in linear algebra terms is (see also Fig. 3): h = Aa and a = AT h (7) (where h is the hubness vector, with the hub values for all the nodes; a is the authority vector; A is the adjacency matrix of the graph; and AT its transpose).",
                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",
                "Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.",
                "And, also, a good unhub links positively good unauthorities and negatively good authorities; a good unauthority is linked positively from good unhubs and negatively from good hubs.",

                "Similarly, hubness should be more similar to Outlinks, thus less meaningful, although the interplay between hub and authority might lead to the discovery of something different.",
                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",
                "Thus the two graphs in Figs. 2c and 2d can be analyzed independently.",
                "In fact the entire HITS analysis could be done in one direction only, with just APM(s, t) values or alternatively with just APA(s, t).",
                "As discussed below, probably most interest resides in the hubness of topics and the authority of systems, so the latter makes sense.",
                "However, in this paper, we pursue both analyses together, because the symmetry itself is interesting.",
                "Considering Fig. 2c we can state that: • Authority a(t) of a topic node t increases when: - if h(si) > 0, APM(si, t) increases (or if APM(si, t) > 0, h(si) increases); - if h(si) < 0, APM(si, t) decreases (or if APM(si, t) < 0, h(si) decreases). • Hubness h(s) of a system node s increases when: - if a(tj) > 0, APM(s, tj) increases (or, if APM(s, tj) > 0, a(tj) increases); - if a(tj) < 0, APM(s, tj) decreases (or, if APM(s, tj) < 0, a(tj) decreases).",
                "We can summarize this as: a(t) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those systems with high h(s); h(s) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those topics with high a(t).",

                "Authority a(s) of a system node s measures system effectiveness: it increases with the weight on the arc (i.e., APA(s, tj)) and the hubness of the incoming topic nodes tj.",

                "Intuitively, we can state that A system has a higher authority if it is more effective on topics with high hubness; and A topic has a higher hubness if it is easier for those systems which are more effective in general.",
                "Conversely for system hubness and topic authority: A topic has a higher authority if it is easier on systems with high hubness; and A system has a higher hubness if it is more effective for those topics which are easier in general.",
                "Therefore, for each system we have two indicators: authority (a(s)), measuring system effectiveness, and hubness (h(s)), measuring system capability to estimate topic ease.",

                "However, this phenomenon is quite strong.",
                "This is also confirmed by the work being done on the TREC Robust Track [14].",
                "In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).",
                "The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8].",
                "GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82.",
                "To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001).",
                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",

(2) MAPs are indicators of systems performance: higher MAP means good system.",
                "AAP are indicators of the performance on a topic: higher AAP means easy topic - a topic on which all or most systems have good performance. 3.2 Critique of pure AP MAP is a standard, well known, and widely used IR effectiveness measure.",
                "Single AP values are used too (e.g., in AP histograms).",
                "Topic difficulty is often discussed (e.g., in TREC Robust track [14]), although AAP values are not used and, to the best of our knowledge, have never been proposed (the median, not the average, of AP on a topic is used to produce TREC AP histograms [11]).",
                "However, the AP values in Tab. 1 present two limitations, which are symmetric in some respect: • Problem 1.",
                "They are not reliable to compare the effectiveness of a system on different topics, relative to the other systems.",
                "If, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s1, t2), can we infer that s1 is a good system (i.e., has a good performance) on t1 and a bad system on t2?",
                "The answer is no: t1 might be an easy topic (with high AAP) and t2 a difficult one (low AAP).",
                "See an example in Tab. 1b: s1 is outperformed (on average) by the other systems on t1, and it outperforms the other systems on t2. • Problem 2.",
                "Conversely, if, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s2, t1), can we infer that t1 is considered easier by s1 than by s2?",
                "No, we cannot: s1 might be a good system (with high MAP) and s2 a bad one (low MAP); see an example in Tab. 1b.",
                "These two problems are a sort of breakdown of the well known high influence of topics on IR evaluation; again, our formulation makes explicit the topics / systems symmetry. 3.3 2nd step: normalizations To avoid these two problems, we can normalize the AP table in two ways.",

                "Each AP(si, tj) value in the table depends on both system goodness and topic ease (the value will increase if a system is good and/or the topic is easy).",
                "By subtracting from each AP(si, tj) the AAP(tj) value, we obtain normalized AP values (APA(si, tj), Normalized AP according to AAP): APA(si, tj) = AP(si, tj) − AAP(tj), (3) that depend on system performance only (the value will increase only if system performance is good).",
                "See Tab. 2a.",

                "If, for example, APM(s2, t1) > APM(s1, t1), we can infer that t1 is considered easier by s2 than by s1 (see Tab. 2d).",
                "On the basis of Tables 2a and 2b, we can also define two new measures of system effectiveness and topic ease, i.e., a Normalized MAP (MAP), obtained by averaging the APA values on one row in Tab. 2a, and a Normalized AAP (AAP), obtained by averaging the APM values on one column in Tab. 2b: MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 APA(si, tj) (5) AAP(tj) = 1 m mX i=1 APM(si, tj). (6) Thus, overall system performance can be measured, besides by means of MAP, also by means of MAP.",

                "Arcs and weights in the graph can be interpreted as follows: • (weight on) arc s → t: how much the system s thinks that the topic t is easy - assuming that a system has no knowledge of the other systems (or in other words, how easy we might think the topic is, knowing only the results for this one system).",
                "This corresponds to APM values, i.e., to normalized topic ease (Fig. 2a). • (weight on) arc s ← t: how much the topic t thinks that the system s is good - assuming that a topic has no knowledge of the other topics (or in other words, how good we might think the system is, knowing only the results for this one topic).",
                "This corresponds to APA (normalized system effectiveness, Fig. 2b).",
                "Figs. 2c and 2d show the Systems-Topics complete weighted bipartite graph, on a toy example with 4 systems and 2 topics; the graph is split in two parts to have an understandable graphical representation: arcs in Fig. 2c are labeled with APM values; arcs in Fig. 2d are labeled with APA values. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS OF THE GRAPH 4.1 Weighted Inlinks, Outlinks, PageRank The sum of weighted outlinks, i.e., the sum of the weights on the outgoing arcs from each node, is always zero: • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a system s (Fig. 2c) is the sum of all the corresponding APM values on one row of the matrix in Tab. 2b. • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a topic t (Fig. 2d) is the sum of all the corresponding APA (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 2: The relationships between systems and topics (a) and (b); and the Systems-Topics graph for a toy example (c) and (d).",
                "Dashed arcs correspond to negative values. h (a) s1 ... sm t1 ... tn = s1 · · · sm t1 · · · tn s1 ... 0 APM (APA) sm t1 ... APA T 0 tn (APM T ) · a (h) s1 ... sm t1 ... tn Figure 3: Hub and Authority computation values on one row of the transpose of the matrix in Tab. 2a.",
                "The average1 of weighted inlinks is: • MAP for each node corresponding to a system s; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APA values on one column of the APA T part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1). • AAP for each node corresponding to a topic t; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APM values on one column of the APM part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1).",
                "Therefore, weighted inlinks measure either system effectiveness or topic ease; weighted outlinks are not meaningful.",
                "We could also apply the PageRank algorithm to the network; the meaning of the PageRank of a node is not quite so obvious as Inlinks and Outlinks, but it also seems a sensible measure of either system effectiveness or topic ease: if a system is effective, it will have several incoming links with high 1 Usually, the sum of the weights on the incoming arcs to each node is used in place of the average; since the graph is complete, it makes no difference. weights (APA); if a topic is easy it will have high weights (APM) on the incoming links too.",
                "We will see experimental confirmation in the following. 4.2 Hubs and Authorities Let us now turn to more sophisticated indicators.",
                "Kleinbergs HITS algorithm defines, for a directed graph, two indicators: hubness and authority; we reiterate here some of the basic details of the HITS algorithm in order to emphasize both the nature of our generalization and the interpretation of the HITS concepts in this context.",
                "Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs.",
                "As it is well known, an equivalent formulation in linear algebra terms is (see also Fig. 3): h = Aa and a = AT h (7) (where h is the hubness vector, with the hub values for all the nodes; a is the authority vector; A is the adjacency matrix of the graph; and AT its transpose).",
                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",
                "Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.",
                "And, also, a good unhub links positively good unauthorities and negatively good authorities; a good unauthority is linked positively from good unhubs and negatively from good hubs.",
                "Let us now apply generalized HITS to our Systems-Topics graph.",
                "We compute a(s), h(s), a(t), and h(t).",
                "Intuitively, we expect that a(s) is somehow similar to Inlinks, so it should be a measure of either systems effectiveness or topic ease.",
                "Similarly, hubness should be more similar to Outlinks, thus less meaningful, although the interplay between hub and authority might lead to the discovery of something different.",
                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",
                "Thus the two graphs in Figs. 2c and 2d can be analyzed independently.",
                "In fact the entire HITS analysis could be done in one direction only, with just APM(s, t) values or alternatively with just APA(s, t).",
                "As discussed below, probably most interest resides in the hubness of topics and the authority of systems, so the latter makes sense.",
                "However, in this paper, we pursue both analyses together, because the symmetry itself is interesting.",
                "Considering Fig. 2c we can state that: • Authority a(t) of a topic node t increases when: - if h(si) > 0, APM(si, t) increases (or if APM(si, t) > 0, h(si) increases); - if h(si) < 0, APM(si, t) decreases (or if APM(si, t) < 0, h(si) decreases). • Hubness h(s) of a system node s increases when: - if a(tj) > 0, APM(s, tj) increases (or, if APM(s, tj) > 0, a(tj) increases); - if a(tj) < 0, APM(s, tj) decreases (or, if APM(s, tj) < 0, a(tj) decreases).",
                "We can summarize this as: a(t) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those systems with high h(s); h(s) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those topics with high a(t).",
                "Intuitively, authority a(t) of a topic measures topic ease; hubness h(s) of a system measures systems capability to recognize easy topics.",
                "A system with high unhubness (negative hubness) would tend to regard easy topics as hard and hard ones as easy.",

                "Authority a(s) of a system node s measures system effectiveness: it increases with the weight on the arc (i.e., APA(s, tj)) and the hubness of the incoming topic nodes tj.",
                "Hubness h(t) of a topic node t measures topic capability to recognize effective systems: if h(t) > 0, it increases further if APA(s, tj) increases; if h(t) < 0, it increases if APA(s, tj) decreases.",
                "Intuitively, we can state that A system has a higher authority if it is more effective on topics with high hubness; and A topic has a higher hubness if it is easier for those systems which are more effective in general.",
                "Conversely for system hubness and topic authority: A topic has a higher authority if it is easier on systems with high hubness; and A system has a higher hubness if it is more effective for those topics which are easier in general.",
                "Therefore, for each system we have two indicators: authority (a(s)), measuring system effectiveness, and hubness (h(s)), measuring system capability to estimate topic ease.",

                "Fig. 4 shows the distributions of AP, APA, and APM: whereas AP is very skewed, both APA and APM are much more symmetric (as it should be, since they are constructed by subtracting the mean).",
                "Tables 3a and 3b show the Pearsons correlation values between Inlinks, PageRank, Hub, Authority and, respectively, MAP or AAP (Outlinks values are not shown since they are always zero, as seen in Sect. 4).",
                "As expected, Inlinks and PageRank have a perfect correlation with MAP and AAP.",

                "Hubness presents interesting phenomena: both Fig. 5c (correlation with MAP) and Fig. 5d (correlation with AAP) show that correlation is not exact, but neither is it random.",
                "This, given the meaning of hubness (capability in estimating topic ease and system effectiveness), means two things: (i) more effective systems are better at estimating topic ease; and (ii) easier topics are better at estimating system effectiveness.",
                "Whereas the first statement is fine (there is nothing against it), the second is a bit worrying.",
                "It means that system effectiveness in TREC is affected more by easy topics than by difficult topics, which is rather undesirable for quite obvious reasons: a system capable of performing well on a difficult topic, i.e., on a topic on which the other systems perform badly, would be an important result for IR effectiveness; con-8E-5 -6E-5 -4E-5 -2E-5 0E+0 2E-5 4E-5 6E-5 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 -3E-1 -2E-1 -1E-1 0E+0 1E-1 2E-1 3E-1 4E-1 5E-1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 (a) (b) 0E+0 2E-2 4E-2 6E-2 8E-2 1E-1 1E-1 1E-1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0E+0 1E-5 2E-5 3E-5 4E-5 5E-5 6E-5 7E-5 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 (c) (d) Figure 5: Correlations: MAP (x axis) and authority (y axis) of systems (a); AAP and authority of topics (b); MAP and hub of systems (c) and AAP and hub of topics (d) versely, a system capable of performing well on easy topics is just a confirmation of the state of the art.",
                "Indeed, the correlation between hubness and AAP (statement (i) above) is higher than the correlation between hubness and MAP (corresponding to statement (ii)): 0.92 vs. 0.80.",
                "However, this phenomenon is quite strong.",
                "This is also confirmed by the work being done on the TREC Robust Track [14].",
                "In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).",
                "The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8].",
                "GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82.",
                "To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001).",
                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",
                "Hopefully, further analyses of the graph defined in this paper, according to the approach described, can be insightful for a better understanding of TREC or similar data.",

                "We apply this method to an analysis of TREC 8 data; among the results, we find that authority measures systems performance, that hubness of topics reveals that some topics are better than others at distinguishing more or less effective systems, that with current measures a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics, and that by using different effectiveness measures this is no longer the case.",

                "INTRODUCTION Evaluation is a primary concern in the Information Retrieval (IR) field.",
                "TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) [12, 15] is an annual benchmarking exercise that has become a de facto standard in IR evaluation: before the actual conference, TREC provides to participants a collection of documents and a set of topics (representations of information needs).",
                "Participants use their systems to retrieve, and submit to TREC, a list of documents for each topic.",
                "After the lists have been submitted and pooled, the TREC organizers employ human assessors to provide relevance judgements on the pooled set.",
                "This defines a set of relevant documents for each topic.",
                "System effectiveness is then measured by well established metrics (<br>mean average precision</br> being the most used).",
                "Other conferences such as NTCIR, INEX, CLEF provide comparable data.",
                "Network analysis is a discipline that studies features and properties of (usually large) networks, or graphs.",
                "Of particular importance is Social Network Analysis [16], that studies networks made up by links among humans (friendship, acquaintance, co-authorship, bibliographic citation, etc.).",
                "Network analysis and IR fruitfully meet in Web Search Engine implementation, as is already described in textbooks [3,6].",
                "Current search engines use link analysis techniques to help rank the retrieved documents.",
                "Some indicators (and the corresponding algorithms that compute them) have been found useful in this respect, and are nowadays well known: Inlinks (the number of links to a Web page), PageRank [7], and HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) [5].",
                "Several extensions to these algorithms have been and are being proposed.",
                "These indicators and algorithms might be quite general in nature, and can be used for applications which are very different from search result ranking.",
                "One example is using HITS for stemming, as described by Agosti et al. [1].",
                "In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a method for constructing a network, specifically a weighted complete bidirectional directed bipartite graph, on a set of TREC topics and participating systems.",
                "Links represent effectiveness measurements on system-topic pairs.",
                "We then apply analysis methods originally developed for search applications to the resulting network.",
                "This reveals phenomena previously hidden in TREC data.",
                "In passing, we also provide a small generalization to Kleinbergs HITS algorithm, as well as to Inlinks and PageRank.",
                "The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 gives some motivations for the work.",
                "Sect. 3 presents the basic ideas of normalizing average precision and of constructing a systemstopics graph, whose properties are analyzed in Sect. 4; Sect. 5 presents some experiments on TREC 8 data; Sect. 6 discusses some issues and Sect. 7 closes the paper. 2.",

                "Some topics are easier than others; 3.",
                "Some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; 4.",
                "Some topics are better than others at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "The first of these hypotheses needs no further justification - every reported significant difference between any two systems supports it.",
                "There is now also quite a lot of evidence for the second, centered on the TREC Robust Track [14].",
                "Our primary interest is in the third and fourth.",
                "The third might be regarded as being of purely academic interest; however, the fourth has the potential for being of major practical importance in evaluation studies.",
                "If we could identify a relatively small number of topics which were really good at distinguishing effective and ineffective systems, we could save considerable effort in evaluating systems.",
                "One possible direction from this point would be to attempt direct identification of such small sets of topics.",
                "However, in the present paper, we seek instead to explore the relationships suggested by the hypotheses, between what different topics tell us about systems and what different systems tell us about topics.",
                "We seek methods of building and analysing a matrix of system-topic normalised performances, with a view to giving insight into the issue and confirming or refuting the third and fourth hypotheses.",
                "It turns out that the obvious symmetry implied by the above formulation of the hypotheses is a property worth investigating, and the investigation does indeed give us valuable insights. 3.",
                "THE IDEA 3.1 1st step: average precision table From TREC results, one can produce an Average Precision (AP) table (see Tab. 1a): each AP(si, tj) value measures the AP of system si on topic tj.",
                "Besides AP values, the table shows <br>mean average precision</br> (MAP) values i.e., the mean of the AP values for a single system over all topics, and what we call Average Average Precision (AAP) values i.e., the average of the AP values for a single topic over all systems: MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 AP(si, tj), (1) AAP(tj) = 1 m mX i=1 AP(si, tj). (2) MAPs are indicators of systems performance: higher MAP means good system.",
                "AAP are indicators of the performance on a topic: higher AAP means easy topic - a topic on which all or most systems have good performance. 3.2 Critique of pure AP MAP is a standard, well known, and widely used IR effectiveness measure.",
                "Single AP values are used too (e.g., in AP histograms).",
                "Topic difficulty is often discussed (e.g., in TREC Robust track [14]), although AAP values are not used and, to the best of our knowledge, have never been proposed (the median, not the average, of AP on a topic is used to produce TREC AP histograms [11]).",
                "However, the AP values in Tab. 1 present two limitations, which are symmetric in some respect: • Problem 1.",
                "They are not reliable to compare the effectiveness of a system on different topics, relative to the other systems.",
                "If, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s1, t2), can we infer that s1 is a good system (i.e., has a good performance) on t1 and a bad system on t2?",
                "The answer is no: t1 might be an easy topic (with high AAP) and t2 a difficult one (low AAP).",
                "See an example in Tab. 1b: s1 is outperformed (on average) by the other systems on t1, and it outperforms the other systems on t2. • Problem 2.",
                "Conversely, if, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s2, t1), can we infer that t1 is considered easier by s1 than by s2?",
                "No, we cannot: s1 might be a good system (with high MAP) and s2 a bad one (low MAP); see an example in Tab. 1b.",
                "These two problems are a sort of breakdown of the well known high influence of topics on IR evaluation; again, our formulation makes explicit the topics / systems symmetry. 3.3 2nd step: normalizations To avoid these two problems, we can normalize the AP table in two ways.",
                "The first normalization removes the influence of the single topic ease on system performance.",
                "Each AP(si, tj) value in the table depends on both system goodness and topic ease (the value will increase if a system is good and/or the topic is easy).",
                "By subtracting from each AP(si, tj) the AAP(tj) value, we obtain normalized AP values (APA(si, tj), Normalized AP according to AAP): APA(si, tj) = AP(si, tj) − AAP(tj), (3) that depend on system performance only (the value will increase only if system performance is good).",
                "See Tab. 2a.",
                "The second normalization removes the influence of the single system effectiveness on topic ease: by subtracting from each AP(si, tj) the MAP(si) value, we obtain normalized AP values (APM(si, tj), Normalized AP according to MAP): APM(si, tj) = AP(si, tj) − MAP(si), (4) that depend on topic ease only (the value will increase only if the topic is easy, i.e., all systems perform well on that topic).",
                "See Tab. 2b.",
                "In other words, APA avoids Problem 1: APA(s, t) values measure the performance of system s on topic t normalized t1 · · · tn MAP s1 APA(s1, t1) · · · APA(s1, tn) MAP(s1) ... ... ... sm APA(sm, t1) · · · APA(sm, tn) MAP(sm) 0 · · · 0 0 (a) t1 · · · tn s1 APM(s1, t1) · · · APM(s1, tn) 0 ... ... ... sm APM(sm, t1) · · · APM(sm, tn) 0 AAP AAP(t1) · · · AAP(tn) 0 (b) t1 t2 · · · MAP s1 −0.1 0.1 · · · . . . s2 0.2 · · · · · · . . . ... ... ... 0 0 · · · t1 t2 · · · s1 −0.1 −0.2 · · · 0 s2 0.1 · · · · · · 0 ... ... ...

                "Now, if, for example, APA(s1, t2) > APA(s1, t1), we can infer that s1 is a good system on t2 and a bad system on t1 (see Tab. 2c).",
                "Vice versa, APM avoids Problem 2: APM(s, t) values measure the ease of topic t according to system s, normalized according to goodness of the system (good systems will not lead to higher APM values).",
                "If, for example, APM(s2, t1) > APM(s1, t1), we can infer that t1 is considered easier by s2 than by s1 (see Tab. 2d).",
                "On the basis of Tables 2a and 2b, we can also define two new measures of system effectiveness and topic ease, i.e., a Normalized MAP (MAP), obtained by averaging the APA values on one row in Tab. 2a, and a Normalized AAP (AAP), obtained by averaging the APM values on one column in Tab. 2b: MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 APA(si, tj) (5) AAP(tj) = 1 m mX i=1 APM(si, tj). (6) Thus, overall system performance can be measured, besides by means of MAP, also by means of MAP.",
                "Moreover, MAP is equivalent to MAP, as can be immediately proved by using Eqs. (5), (3), and (1): MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 (AP(si, tj) − AAP(tj)) = = MAP(si) − 1 n nX j=1 AAP(tj) (and 1 n Pn j=1 AAP(tj) is the same for all systems).",
                "And, conversely, overall topic ease can be measured, besides by t1 · · · tn s1 ... APM sm t1 · · · tn s1 ... APA sm s1 · · · sm t1 · · · tn s1 ... 0 APM 0 sm t1 ... APA T 0 0 tn MAP AAP 0 Figure 1: Construction of the adjacency matrix.",
                "APA T is the transpose of APA. means of AAP, also by means of AAP, and this is equivalent (the proof is analogous, and relies on Eqs. (6), (4), and (2)).",
                "The two Tables 2a and 2b are interesting per se, and can be analyzed in several different ways.",
                "In the following we propose an analysis based on network analysis techniques, mainly Kleinbergs HITS algorithm.",
                "There is a little further discussion of these normalizations in Sect. 6. 3.4 3rd step: Systems-Topics Graph The two tables 2a and 2b can be merged into a single one with the procedure shown in Fig. 1.",
                "The obtained matrix can be interpreted as the adjacency matrix of a complete weighted bipartite graph, that we call Systems-Topics graph.",
                "Arcs and weights in the graph can be interpreted as follows: • (weight on) arc s → t: how much the system s thinks that the topic t is easy - assuming that a system has no knowledge of the other systems (or in other words, how easy we might think the topic is, knowing only the results for this one system).",
                "This corresponds to APM values, i.e., to normalized topic ease (Fig. 2a). • (weight on) arc s ← t: how much the topic t thinks that the system s is good - assuming that a topic has no knowledge of the other topics (or in other words, how good we might think the system is, knowing only the results for this one topic).",
                "This corresponds to APA (normalized system effectiveness, Fig. 2b).",
                "Figs. 2c and 2d show the Systems-Topics complete weighted bipartite graph, on a toy example with 4 systems and 2 topics; the graph is split in two parts to have an understandable graphical representation: arcs in Fig. 2c are labeled with APM values; arcs in Fig. 2d are labeled with APA values. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS OF THE GRAPH 4.1 Weighted Inlinks, Outlinks, PageRank The sum of weighted outlinks, i.e., the sum of the weights on the outgoing arcs from each node, is always zero: • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a system s (Fig. 2c) is the sum of all the corresponding APM values on one row of the matrix in Tab. 2b. • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a topic t (Fig. 2d) is the sum of all the corresponding APA (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 2: The relationships between systems and topics (a) and (b); and the Systems-Topics graph for a toy example (c) and (d).",
                "Dashed arcs correspond to negative values. h (a) s1 ... sm t1 ... tn = s1 · · · sm t1 · · · tn s1 ... 0 APM (APA) sm t1 ... APA T 0 tn (APM T ) · a (h) s1 ... sm t1 ... tn Figure 3: Hub and Authority computation values on one row of the transpose of the matrix in Tab. 2a.",
                "The average1 of weighted inlinks is: • MAP for each node corresponding to a system s; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APA values on one column of the APA T part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1). • AAP for each node corresponding to a topic t; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APM values on one column of the APM part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1).",
                "Therefore, weighted inlinks measure either system effectiveness or topic ease; weighted outlinks are not meaningful.",
                "We could also apply the PageRank algorithm to the network; the meaning of the PageRank of a node is not quite so obvious as Inlinks and Outlinks, but it also seems a sensible measure of either system effectiveness or topic ease: if a system is effective, it will have several incoming links with high 1 Usually, the sum of the weights on the incoming arcs to each node is used in place of the average; since the graph is complete, it makes no difference. weights (APA); if a topic is easy it will have high weights (APM) on the incoming links too.",
                "We will see experimental confirmation in the following. 4.2 Hubs and Authorities Let us now turn to more sophisticated indicators.",
                "Kleinbergs HITS algorithm defines, for a directed graph, two indicators: hubness and authority; we reiterate here some of the basic details of the HITS algorithm in order to emphasize both the nature of our generalization and the interpretation of the HITS concepts in this context.",
                "Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs.",
                "As it is well known, an equivalent formulation in linear algebra terms is (see also Fig. 3): h = Aa and a = AT h (7) (where h is the hubness vector, with the hub values for all the nodes; a is the authority vector; A is the adjacency matrix of the graph; and AT its transpose).",
                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",
                "Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.",
                "And, also, a good unhub links positively good unauthorities and negatively good authorities; a good unauthority is linked positively from good unhubs and negatively from good hubs.",
                "Let us now apply generalized HITS to our Systems-Topics graph.",
                "We compute a(s), h(s), a(t), and h(t).",
                "Intuitively, we expect that a(s) is somehow similar to Inlinks, so it should be a measure of either systems effectiveness or topic ease.",
                "Similarly, hubness should be more similar to Outlinks, thus less meaningful, although the interplay between hub and authority might lead to the discovery of something different.",
                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",
                "Thus the two graphs in Figs. 2c and 2d can be analyzed independently.",
                "In fact the entire HITS analysis could be done in one direction only, with just APM(s, t) values or alternatively with just APA(s, t).",
                "As discussed below, probably most interest resides in the hubness of topics and the authority of systems, so the latter makes sense.",
                "However, in this paper, we pursue both analyses together, because the symmetry itself is interesting.",
                "Considering Fig. 2c we can state that: • Authority a(t) of a topic node t increases when: - if h(si) > 0, APM(si, t) increases (or if APM(si, t) > 0, h(si) increases); - if h(si) < 0, APM(si, t) decreases (or if APM(si, t) < 0, h(si) decreases). • Hubness h(s) of a system node s increases when: - if a(tj) > 0, APM(s, tj) increases (or, if APM(s, tj) > 0, a(tj) increases); - if a(tj) < 0, APM(s, tj) decreases (or, if APM(s, tj) < 0, a(tj) decreases).",
                "We can summarize this as: a(t) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those systems with high h(s); h(s) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those topics with high a(t).",
                "Intuitively, authority a(t) of a topic measures topic ease; hubness h(s) of a system measures systems capability to recognize easy topics.",
                "A system with high unhubness (negative hubness) would tend to regard easy topics as hard and hard ones as easy.",
                "The situation for Fig. 2d, i.e., for a(s) and h(t), is analogous.",
                "Authority a(s) of a system node s measures system effectiveness: it increases with the weight on the arc (i.e., APA(s, tj)) and the hubness of the incoming topic nodes tj.",
                "Hubness h(t) of a topic node t measures topic capability to recognize effective systems: if h(t) > 0, it increases further if APA(s, tj) increases; if h(t) < 0, it increases if APA(s, tj) decreases.",
                "Intuitively, we can state that A system has a higher authority if it is more effective on topics with high hubness; and A topic has a higher hubness if it is easier for those systems which are more effective in general.",
                "Conversely for system hubness and topic authority: A topic has a higher authority if it is easier on systems with high hubness; and A system has a higher hubness if it is more effective for those topics which are easier in general.",
                "Therefore, for each system we have two indicators: authority (a(s)), measuring system effectiveness, and hubness (h(s)), measuring system capability to estimate topic ease.",
                "And for each topic, we have two indicators: authority (a(t)), measuring topic ease, and hubness (h(t)), measuring topic capability to estimate systems effectiveness.",
                "We can define them formally as a(s) = X t h(t) · APA(s, t), h(t) = X s a(s) · APA(s, t), a(t) = X s h(s) · APM(s, t), h(s) = X t a(t) · APM(s, t).",
                "We observe that the hubness of topics may be of particular interest for evaluation studies.",
                "It may be that we can evaluate the effectiveness of systems efficiently by using relatively few high-hubness topics. 5.",
                "EXPERIMENTS We now turn to discuss if these indicators are meaningful and useful in practice, and how they correlate with standard measures used in TREC.",

                "Fig. 4 shows the distributions of AP, APA, and APM: whereas AP is very skewed, both APA and APM are much more symmetric (as it should be, since they are constructed by subtracting the mean).",
                "Tables 3a and 3b show the Pearsons correlation values between Inlinks, PageRank, Hub, Authority and, respectively, MAP or AAP (Outlinks values are not shown since they are always zero, as seen in Sect. 4).",

                "The correlations chart in Figs. 5a and 5b demonstrate the high correlation between Authority and MAP or AAP.",
                "Hubness presents interesting phenomena: both Fig. 5c (correlation with MAP) and Fig. 5d (correlation with AAP) show that correlation is not exact, but neither is it random.",
                "This, given the meaning of hubness (capability in estimating topic ease and system effectiveness), means two things: (i) more effective systems are better at estimating topic ease; and (ii) easier topics are better at estimating system effectiveness.",
                "Whereas the first statement is fine (there is nothing against it), the second is a bit worrying.",
                "It means that system effectiveness in TREC is affected more by easy topics than by difficult topics, which is rather undesirable for quite obvious reasons: a system capable of performing well on a difficult topic, i.e., on a topic on which the other systems perform badly, would be an important result for IR effectiveness; con-8E-5 -6E-5 -4E-5 -2E-5 0E+0 2E-5 4E-5 6E-5 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 -3E-1 -2E-1 -1E-1 0E+0 1E-1 2E-1 3E-1 4E-1 5E-1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 (a) (b) 0E+0 2E-2 4E-2 6E-2 8E-2 1E-1 1E-1 1E-1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0E+0 1E-5 2E-5 3E-5 4E-5 5E-5 6E-5 7E-5 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 (c) (d) Figure 5: Correlations: MAP (x axis) and authority (y axis) of systems (a); AAP and authority of topics (b); MAP and hub of systems (c) and AAP and hub of topics (d) versely, a system capable of performing well on easy topics is just a confirmation of the state of the art.",
                "Indeed, the correlation between hubness and AAP (statement (i) above) is higher than the correlation between hubness and MAP (corresponding to statement (ii)): 0.92 vs. 0.80.",
                "However, this phenomenon is quite strong.",
                "This is also confirmed by the work being done on the TREC Robust Track [14].",
                "In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).",
                "The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8].",
                "GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82.",
                "To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001).",
                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (<br>mean average precision</br>) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",
                "Hopefully, further analyses of the graph defined in this paper, according to the approach described, can be insightful for a better understanding of TREC or similar data.",

                "Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs.",

                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",
                "Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.",

                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",

                "Authority a(s) of a system node s measures system effectiveness: it increases with the weight on the arc (i.e., APA(s, tj)) and the hubness of the incoming topic nodes tj.",

                "In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).",
                "The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8].",
                "GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82.",
                "To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001).",
                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",

                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",
                "Hopefully, further analyses of the graph defined in this paper, according to the approach described, can be insightful for a better understanding of TREC or similar data.",

(2) MAPs are indicators of systems performance: higher MAP means good system.",

                "This corresponds to APM values, i.e., to normalized topic ease (Fig. 2a). • (weight on) arc s ← t: how much the topic t thinks that the system s is good - assuming that a topic has no knowledge of the other topics (or in other words, how good we might think the system is, knowing only the results for this one topic).",

                "Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs.",
                "As it is well known, an equivalent formulation in linear algebra terms is (see also Fig. 3): h = Aa and a = AT h (7) (where h is the hubness vector, with the hub values for all the nodes; a is the authority vector; A is the adjacency matrix of the graph; and AT its transpose).",
                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",
                "Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.",
                "And, also, a good unhub links positively good unauthorities and negatively good authorities; a good unauthority is linked positively from good unhubs and negatively from good hubs.",

                "Similarly, hubness should be more similar to Outlinks, thus less meaningful, although the interplay between hub and authority might lead to the discovery of something different.",
                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",
                "Thus the two graphs in Figs. 2c and 2d can be analyzed independently.",
                "In fact the entire HITS analysis could be done in one direction only, with just APM(s, t) values or alternatively with just APA(s, t).",
                "As discussed below, probably most interest resides in the hubness of topics and the authority of systems, so the latter makes sense.",

                "Considering Fig. 2c we can state that: • Authority a(t) of a topic node t increases when: - if h(si) > 0, APM(si, t) increases (or if APM(si, t) > 0, h(si) increases); - if h(si) < 0, APM(si, t) decreases (or if APM(si, t) < 0, h(si) decreases). • Hubness h(s) of a system node s increases when: - if a(tj) > 0, APM(s, tj) increases (or, if APM(s, tj) > 0, a(tj) increases); - if a(tj) < 0, APM(s, tj) decreases (or, if APM(s, tj) < 0, a(tj) decreases).",
                "We can summarize this as: a(t) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those systems with high h(s); h(s) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those topics with high a(t).",

                "The situation for Fig. 2d, i.e., for a(s) and h(t), is analogous.",
                "Authority a(s) of a system node s measures system effectiveness: it increases with the weight on the arc (i.e., APA(s, tj)) and the hubness of the incoming topic nodes tj.",
                "Hubness h(t) of a topic node t measures topic capability to recognize effective systems: if h(t) > 0, it increases further if APA(s, tj) increases; if h(t) < 0, it increases if APA(s, tj) decreases.",
                "Intuitively, we can state that A system has a higher authority if it is more effective on topics with high hubness; and A topic has a higher hubness if it is easier for those systems which are more effective in general.",
                "Conversely for system hubness and topic authority: A topic has a higher authority if it is easier on systems with high hubness; and A system has a higher hubness if it is more effective for those topics which are easier in general.",
                "Therefore, for each system we have two indicators: authority (a(s)), measuring system effectiveness, and hubness (h(s)), measuring system capability to estimate topic ease.",

                "However, this phenomenon is quite strong.",
                "This is also confirmed by the work being done on the TREC Robust Track [14].",
                "In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).",
                "The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8].",
                "GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82.",
                "To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001).",
                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",

(2) MAPs are indicators of systems performance: higher MAP means good system.",

                "Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs.",
                "As it is well known, an equivalent formulation in linear algebra terms is (see also Fig. 3): h = Aa and a = AT h (7) (where h is the hubness vector, with the hub values for all the nodes; a is the authority vector; A is the adjacency matrix of the graph; and AT its transpose).",
                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",
                "Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.",
                "And, also, a good unhub links positively good unauthorities and negatively good authorities; a good unauthority is linked positively from good unhubs and negatively from good hubs.",

                "Similarly, hubness should be more similar to Outlinks, thus less meaningful, although the interplay between hub and authority might lead to the discovery of something different.",
                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",
                "Thus the two graphs in Figs. 2c and 2d can be analyzed independently.",
                "In fact the entire HITS analysis could be done in one direction only, with just APM(s, t) values or alternatively with just APA(s, t).",
                "As discussed below, probably most interest resides in the hubness of topics and the authority of systems, so the latter makes sense.",
                "However, in this paper, we pursue both analyses together, because the symmetry itself is interesting.",

                "Fig. 4 shows the distributions of AP, APA, and APM: whereas AP is very skewed, both APA and APM are much more symmetric (as it should be, since they are constructed by subtracting the mean).",
                "Tables 3a and 3b show the Pearsons correlation values between Inlinks, PageRank, Hub, Authority and, respectively, MAP or AAP (Outlinks values are not shown since they are always zero, as seen in Sect. 4).",
                "As expected, Inlinks and PageRank have a perfect correlation with MAP and AAP.",

                "Hubness presents interesting phenomena: both Fig. 5c (correlation with MAP) and Fig. 5d (correlation with AAP) show that correlation is not exact, but neither is it random.",

                "Indeed, the correlation between hubness and AAP (statement (i) above) is higher than the correlation between hubness and MAP (corresponding to statement (ii)): 0.92 vs. 0.80.",
                "However, this phenomenon is quite strong.",
                "This is also confirmed by the work being done on the TREC Robust Track [14].",
                "In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).",
                "The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8].",
                "GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82.",
                "To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001).",
                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",
                "Hopefully, further analyses of the graph defined in this paper, according to the approach described, can be insightful for a better understanding of TREC or similar data.",

(2) MAPs are indicators of systems performance: higher MAP means good system.",
                "AAP are indicators of the performance on a topic: higher AAP means easy topic - a topic on which all or most systems have good performance. 3.2 Critique of pure AP MAP is a standard, well known, and widely used IR effectiveness measure.",
                "Single AP values are used too (e.g., in AP histograms).",
                "Topic difficulty is often discussed (e.g., in TREC Robust track [14]), although AAP values are not used and, to the best of our knowledge, have never been proposed (the median, not the average, of AP on a topic is used to produce TREC AP histograms [11]).",
                "However, the AP values in Tab. 1 present two limitations, which are symmetric in some respect: • Problem 1.",
                "They are not reliable to compare the effectiveness of a system on different topics, relative to the other systems.",
                "If, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s1, t2), can we infer that s1 is a good system (i.e., has a good performance) on t1 and a bad system on t2?",
                "The answer is no: t1 might be an easy topic (with high AAP) and t2 a difficult one (low AAP).",
                "See an example in Tab. 1b: s1 is outperformed (on average) by the other systems on t1, and it outperforms the other systems on t2. • Problem 2.",
                "Conversely, if, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s2, t1), can we infer that t1 is considered easier by s1 than by s2?",
                "No, we cannot: s1 might be a good system (with high MAP) and s2 a bad one (low MAP); see an example in Tab. 1b.",

                "On the basis of Tables 2a and 2b, we can also define two new measures of system effectiveness and topic ease, i.e., a Normalized MAP (MAP), obtained by averaging the APA values on one row in Tab. 2a, and a Normalized AAP (AAP), obtained by averaging the APM values on one column in Tab. 2b: MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 APA(si, tj) (5) AAP(tj) = 1 m mX i=1 APM(si, tj). (6) Thus, overall system performance can be measured, besides by means of MAP, also by means of MAP.",

                "Arcs and weights in the graph can be interpreted as follows: • (weight on) arc s → t: how much the system s thinks that the topic t is easy - assuming that a system has no knowledge of the other systems (or in other words, how easy we might think the topic is, knowing only the results for this one system).",
                "This corresponds to APM values, i.e., to normalized topic ease (Fig. 2a). • (weight on) arc s ← t: how much the topic t thinks that the system s is good - assuming that a topic has no knowledge of the other topics (or in other words, how good we might think the system is, knowing only the results for this one topic).",
                "This corresponds to APA (normalized system effectiveness, Fig. 2b).",
                "Figs. 2c and 2d show the Systems-Topics complete weighted bipartite graph, on a toy example with 4 systems and 2 topics; the graph is split in two parts to have an understandable graphical representation: arcs in Fig. 2c are labeled with APM values; arcs in Fig. 2d are labeled with APA values. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS OF THE GRAPH 4.1 Weighted Inlinks, Outlinks, <br>pagerank</br> The sum of weighted outlinks, i.e., the sum of the weights on the outgoing arcs from each node, is always zero: • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a system s (Fig. 2c) is the sum of all the corresponding APM values on one row of the matrix in Tab. 2b. • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a topic t (Fig. 2d) is the sum of all the corresponding APA (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 2: The relationships between systems and topics (a) and (b); and the Systems-Topics graph for a toy example (c) and (d).",

                "The average1 of weighted inlinks is: • MAP for each node corresponding to a system s; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APA values on one column of the APA T part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1). • AAP for each node corresponding to a topic t; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APM values on one column of the APM part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1).",
                "Therefore, weighted inlinks measure either system effectiveness or topic ease; weighted outlinks are not meaningful.",
                "We could also apply the <br>pagerank</br> algorithm to the network; the meaning of the <br>pagerank</br> of a node is not quite so obvious as Inlinks and Outlinks, but it also seems a sensible measure of either system effectiveness or topic ease: if a system is effective, it will have several incoming links with high 1 Usually, the sum of the weights on the incoming arcs to each node is used in place of the average; since the graph is complete, it makes no difference. weights (APA); if a topic is easy it will have high weights (APM) on the incoming links too.",
                "We will see experimental confirmation in the following. 4.2 Hubs and Authorities Let us now turn to more sophisticated indicators.",
                "Kleinbergs HITS algorithm defines, for a directed graph, two indicators: hubness and authority; we reiterate here some of the basic details of the HITS algorithm in order to emphasize both the nature of our generalization and the interpretation of the HITS concepts in this context.",
                "Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs.",
                "As it is well known, an equivalent formulation in linear algebra terms is (see also Fig. 3): h = Aa and a = AT h (7) (where h is the hubness vector, with the hub values for all the nodes; a is the authority vector; A is the adjacency matrix of the graph; and AT its transpose).",
                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",
                "Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.",
                "And, also, a good unhub links positively good unauthorities and negatively good authorities; a good unauthority is linked positively from good unhubs and negatively from good hubs.",
                "Let us now apply generalized HITS to our Systems-Topics graph.",
                "We compute a(s), h(s), a(t), and h(t).",
                "Intuitively, we expect that a(s) is somehow similar to Inlinks, so it should be a measure of either systems effectiveness or topic ease.",
                "Similarly, hubness should be more similar to Outlinks, thus less meaningful, although the interplay between hub and authority might lead to the discovery of something different.",
                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",
                "Thus the two graphs in Figs. 2c and 2d can be analyzed independently.",
                "In fact the entire HITS analysis could be done in one direction only, with just APM(s, t) values or alternatively with just APA(s, t).",
                "As discussed below, probably most interest resides in the hubness of topics and the authority of systems, so the latter makes sense.",
                "However, in this paper, we pursue both analyses together, because the symmetry itself is interesting.",
                "Considering Fig. 2c we can state that: • Authority a(t) of a topic node t increases when: - if h(si) > 0, APM(si, t) increases (or if APM(si, t) > 0, h(si) increases); - if h(si) < 0, APM(si, t) decreases (or if APM(si, t) < 0, h(si) decreases). • Hubness h(s) of a system node s increases when: - if a(tj) > 0, APM(s, tj) increases (or, if APM(s, tj) > 0, a(tj) increases); - if a(tj) < 0, APM(s, tj) decreases (or, if APM(s, tj) < 0, a(tj) decreases).",
                "We can summarize this as: a(t) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those systems with high h(s); h(s) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those topics with high a(t).",

                "However, this phenomenon is quite strong.",
                "This is also confirmed by the work being done on the TREC Robust Track [14].",
                "In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).",
                "The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8].",
                "GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82.",
                "To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001).",
                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to <br>pagerank</br>.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",

(2) MAPs are indicators of systems performance: higher MAP means good system.",
                "AAP are indicators of the performance on a topic: higher AAP means easy topic - a topic on which all or most systems have good performance. 3.2 Critique of pure AP MAP is a standard, well known, and widely used IR effectiveness measure.",
                "Single AP values are used too (e.g., in AP histograms).",
                "Topic difficulty is often discussed (e.g., in TREC Robust track [14]), although AAP values are not used and, to the best of our knowledge, have never been proposed (the median, not the average, of AP on a topic is used to produce TREC AP histograms [11]).",
                "However, the AP values in Tab. 1 present two limitations, which are symmetric in some respect: • Problem 1.",
                "They are not reliable to compare the effectiveness of a system on different topics, relative to the other systems.",
                "If, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s1, t2), can we infer that s1 is a good system (i.e., has a good performance) on t1 and a bad system on t2?",
                "The answer is no: t1 might be an easy topic (with high AAP) and t2 a difficult one (low AAP).",
                "See an example in Tab. 1b: s1 is outperformed (on average) by the other systems on t1, and it outperforms the other systems on t2. • Problem 2.",
                "Conversely, if, for example, AP(s1, t1) > AP(s2, t1), can we infer that t1 is considered easier by s1 than by s2?",
                "No, we cannot: s1 might be a good system (with high MAP) and s2 a bad one (low MAP); see an example in Tab. 1b.",
                "These two problems are a sort of breakdown of the well known high influence of topics on IR evaluation; again, our formulation makes explicit the topics / systems symmetry. 3.3 2nd step: normalizations To avoid these two problems, we can normalize the AP table in two ways.",

                "Each AP(si, tj) value in the table depends on both system goodness and topic ease (the value will increase if a system is good and/or the topic is easy).",
                "By subtracting from each AP(si, tj) the AAP(tj) value, we obtain normalized AP values (APA(si, tj), Normalized AP according to AAP): APA(si, tj) = AP(si, tj) − AAP(tj), (3) that depend on system performance only (the value will increase only if system performance is good).",
                "See Tab. 2a.",

                "On the basis of Tables 2a and 2b, we can also define two new measures of system effectiveness and topic ease, i.e., a Normalized MAP (MAP), obtained by averaging the APA values on one row in Tab. 2a, and a Normalized AAP (AAP), obtained by averaging the APM values on one column in Tab. 2b: MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 APA(si, tj) (5) AAP(tj) = 1 m mX i=1 APM(si, tj). (6) Thus, overall system performance can be measured, besides by means of MAP, also by means of MAP.",
                "Moreover, MAP is equivalent to MAP, as can be immediately proved by using Eqs. (5), (3), and (1): MAP(si) = 1 n nX j=1 (AP(si, tj) − AAP(tj)) = = MAP(si) − 1 n nX j=1 AAP(tj) (and 1 n Pn j=1 AAP(tj) is the same for all systems).",

                "There is a little further discussion of these normalizations in Sect. 6. 3.4 3rd step: Systems-Topics Graph The two tables 2a and 2b can be merged into a single one with the procedure shown in Fig. 1.",

                "Arcs and weights in the graph can be interpreted as follows: • (weight on) arc s → t: how much the system s thinks that the topic t is easy - assuming that a system has no knowledge of the other systems (or in other words, how easy we might think the topic is, knowing only the results for this one system).",
                "This corresponds to APM values, i.e., to normalized topic ease (Fig. 2a). • (weight on) arc s ← t: how much the topic t thinks that the system s is good - assuming that a topic has no knowledge of the other topics (or in other words, how good we might think the system is, knowing only the results for this one topic).",
                "This corresponds to APA (normalized system effectiveness, Fig. 2b).",
                "Figs. 2c and 2d show the Systems-Topics complete weighted bipartite graph, on a toy example with 4 systems and 2 topics; the graph is split in two parts to have an understandable graphical representation: arcs in Fig. 2c are labeled with APM values; arcs in Fig. 2d are labeled with APA values. 4.",
                "ANALYSIS OF THE GRAPH 4.1 Weighted Inlinks, Outlinks, PageRank The sum of weighted outlinks, i.e., the sum of the weights on the outgoing arcs from each node, is always zero: • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a system s (Fig. 2c) is the sum of all the corresponding APM values on one row of the matrix in Tab. 2b. • The outlinks on each node corresponding to a topic t (Fig. 2d) is the sum of all the corresponding APA (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 2: The relationships between systems and topics (a) and (b); and the Systems-Topics graph for a toy example (c) and (d).",

                "The average1 of weighted inlinks is: • MAP for each node corresponding to a system s; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APA values on one column of the APA T part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1). • AAP for each node corresponding to a topic t; this corresponds to the average of all the corresponding APM values on one column of the APM part of the adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1).",
                "Therefore, weighted inlinks measure either system effectiveness or topic ease; weighted outlinks are not meaningful.",
                "We could also apply the PageRank algorithm to the network; the meaning of the PageRank of a node is not quite so obvious as Inlinks and Outlinks, but it also seems a sensible measure of either system effectiveness or topic ease: if a system is effective, it will have several incoming links with high 1 Usually, the sum of the weights on the incoming arcs to each node is used in place of the average; since the graph is complete, it makes no difference. weights (APA); if a topic is easy it will have high weights (APM) on the incoming links too.",
                "We will see experimental confirmation in the following. 4.2 Hubs and Authorities Let us now turn to more sophisticated indicators.",
                "Kleinbergs HITS algorithm defines, for a directed graph, two indicators: hubness and authority; we reiterate here some of the basic details of the HITS algorithm in order to emphasize both the nature of our generalization and the interpretation of the HITS concepts in this context.",
                "Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs.",
                "As it is well known, an equivalent formulation in linear algebra terms is (see also Fig. 3): h = Aa and a = AT h (7) (where h is the hubness vector, with the hub values for all the nodes; a is the authority vector; A is the adjacency matrix of the graph; and AT its transpose).",
                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",
                "Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.",
                "And, also, a good unhub links positively good unauthorities and negatively good authorities; a good unauthority is linked positively from good unhubs and negatively from good hubs.",
                "Let us now apply generalized HITS to our Systems-Topics graph.",
                "We compute a(s), h(s), a(t), and h(t).",
                "Intuitively, we expect that a(s) is somehow similar to Inlinks, so it should be a measure of either systems effectiveness or topic ease.",
                "Similarly, hubness should be more similar to Outlinks, thus less meaningful, although the interplay between hub and authority might lead to the discovery of something different.",
                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",
                "Thus the two graphs in Figs. 2c and 2d can be analyzed independently.",
                "In fact the entire HITS analysis could be done in one direction only, with just APM(s, t) values or alternatively with just APA(s, t).",
                "As discussed below, probably most interest resides in the hubness of topics and the authority of systems, so the latter makes sense.",
                "However, in this paper, we pursue both analyses together, because the symmetry itself is interesting.",
                "Considering Fig. 2c we can state that: • Authority a(t) of a topic node t increases when: - if h(si) > 0, APM(si, t) increases (or if APM(si, t) > 0, h(si) increases); - if h(si) < 0, APM(si, t) decreases (or if APM(si, t) < 0, h(si) decreases). • Hubness h(s) of a system node s increases when: - if a(tj) > 0, APM(s, tj) increases (or, if APM(s, tj) > 0, a(tj) increases); - if a(tj) < 0, APM(s, tj) decreases (or, if APM(s, tj) < 0, a(tj) decreases).",
                "We can summarize this as: a(t) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those systems with high h(s); h(s) is high if APM(s, t) is high for those topics with high a(t).",
                "Intuitively, authority a(t) of a topic measures topic ease; hubness h(s) of a system measures systems capability to recognize easy topics.",
                "A system with high unhubness (negative hubness) would tend to regard easy topics as hard and hard ones as easy.",
                "The situation for Fig. 2d, i.e., for a(s) and h(t), is analogous.",
                "Authority a(s) of a system node s measures system effectiveness: it increases with the weight on the arc (i.e., APA(s, tj)) and the hubness of the incoming topic nodes tj.",
                "Hubness h(t) of a topic node t measures topic capability to recognize effective systems: if h(t) > 0, it increases further if APA(s, tj) increases; if h(t) < 0, it increases if APA(s, tj) decreases.",
                "Intuitively, we can state that A system has a higher authority if it is more effective on topics with high hubness; and A topic has a higher hubness if it is easier for those systems which are more effective in general.",

                "Indeed, the correlation between hubness and AAP (statement (i) above) is higher than the correlation between hubness and MAP (corresponding to statement (ii)): 0.92 vs. 0.80.",
                "However, this phenomenon is quite strong.",
                "This is also confirmed by the work being done on the TREC Robust Track [14].",
                "In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).",
                "The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8].",
                "GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82.",
                "To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001).",
                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",

                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",
                "Since arc weights can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority; the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.",

                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",
                "Hopefully, further analyses of the graph defined in this paper, according to the approach described, can be insightful for a better understanding of TREC or similar data.",

                "Usually, hubness and authority are defined as h(x) = P x→y a(y) and a(x) = P y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many good hubs.",

                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",
                "Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in a graph.",
                "An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS is still available, although slightly more complex: a good hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs having high weights, from many good hubs.",

                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",

                "However, this phenomenon is quite strong.",
                "This is also confirmed by the work being done on the TREC Robust Track [14].",
                "In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).",
                "The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8].",
                "GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82.",
                "To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001).",
                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in <br>social network analysis</br>, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",

(2) MAPs are indicators of systems performance: higher MAP means good system.",

                "Usually, A contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.",

                "Let us start by remarking that authority of topics and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.",
                "Thus the two graphs in Figs. 2c and 2d can be analyzed independently.",

                "However, this phenomenon is quite strong.",
                "This is also confirmed by the work being done on the TREC Robust Track [14].",
                "In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).",
                "The GMAP (Geometric MAP) metric is defined as the geometric mean of AP values, or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of AP values [8].",
                "GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale (i.e., to low AP values), and this seems reasonable, since, intuitively, a performance increase in MAP values from 0.01 to 0.02 should be more important than an increase from 0.81 to 0.82.",
                "To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab. 1a (zero values are modified into ε = 0.00001).",
                "We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).",
                "This is yet another confirmation that TREC effectiveness as measured by MAP depends mainly on easy topics; GMAP appears to be a more balanced measure.",
                "Note that, perhaps surprisingly, GMAP is indeed fairly well balanced, not biased in the opposite direction - that is, it does not overemphasize the difficult topics.",
                "In Sect. 6.3 below, we discuss another transformation, replacing the log function used in GMAP with logit.",
                "This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).",
                "We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.",
                "An intuitive justification is that negative hubness would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes, e.g., a system which does better on difficult topics, or a topic on which bad systems do better; such systems and topics would be quite strange, and probably do not appear in TREC.",
                "Finally, although one might think that topics with several relevant documents are more important and difficult, this is not the case: there is no correlation between hub (or any other indicator) and the number of documents relevant to a topic. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION 6.1 Related work There has been considerable interest in recent years in questions of statistical significance of effectiveness comparisons between systems (e.g. [2, 9]), and related questions of how many topics might be needed to establish differences (e.g. [13]).",
                "We regard some results of the present study as in some way complementary to this work, in that we make a step towards answering the question Which topics are best for establishing differences?.",
                "The results on evaluation without relevance judgements such as [10] show that, to some extent, good systems agree on which are the good documents.",
                "We have not addressed the question of individual documents in the present analysis, but this effect is certainly analogous to our results. 6.2 Are normalizations necessary?",
                "At this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would happen without the MAP- and AAP-normalizations defined in Sect. 3.3.",
                "Indeed, the process of graph construction (Sect. 3.4) is still valid: both the APM and APA matrices are replaced by the AP one, and then everything goes on as above.",
                "Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.",
                "This is not the case.",
                "From the theoretical point of view, the AP-only graph does not present the interesting properties above discussed: since the AP-only graph is symmetrical (the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight on the corresponding outgoing link), Inlinks and Outlinks assume the same values.",
                "There is symmetry also in computing hub and authority, that assume the same value for each node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs are the same.",
                "This could be stated in more precise and formal terms, but one might still wonder if on the overall graph there are some sort of counterbalancing effects.",
                "It is therefore easier to look at experimental data, which confirm that the normalizations are needed: the correlations between AP, Inlinks, Outlinks, Hub, and/or Authority are all very close to one (none of them is below 0.98). 6.3 Are these normalizations sufficient?",
                "It might be argued that (in the case of APA, for example) the amount we have subtracted from each AP value is topicdependent, therefore the range of the resulting APA value is also topic-dependent (e.g. the maximum is 1 − AAP(tj) and the minimum is − AAP(tj)).",
                "This suggests that the cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in Sect. 3.3 may not be reliable.",
                "A similar issue arises for APM and comparisons across systems.",
                "One possible way to overcome this would be to use an unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line.",
                "Note that in applying the method to GMAP by using log AP, we avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the upper limit.",
                "One way to achieve an unconstrainted range would be to use the logit function rather than the log [4,8].",
                "We have also run this variant (as already reported in Sect. 5 above), and it appears to provide very similar results to the GMAP results already given.",
                "This is not surprising, since in practice the two functions are very similar over most of the operative range.",
                "The normalizations thus seem reliable. 6.4 On AAT and AT A It is well known that h and a vectors are the principal left eigenvectors of AAT and AT A, respectively (this can be easily derived from Eqs. (7)), and that, in the case of citation graphs, AAT and AT A represent, respectively, bibliographic coupling and co-citations.",
                "What is the meaning, if any, of AAT and AT A in our Systems-Topics graph?",
                "It is easy to derive that: AAT [i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[i, k] · A[j, k] otherwise AT A[i, j] = 8 >< >: 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A[k, i] · A[k, j] otherwise (where S is the set of indices corresponding to systems and T the set of indices corresponding to topics).",
                "Thus AAT and AT A are block diagonal matrices, with two blocks each, one relative to systems and one relative to topics: (a) if i, j ∈ S, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈T APM(i, k)·APM(j, k) measures how much the two systems i and j agree in estimating topics ease (APM): high values mean that the two systems agree on topics ease. (b) if i, j ∈ T, then AAT [i, j] = P k∈S APA(k, i)·APA(k, j) measures how much the two topics i and j agree in estimating systems effectiveness (APA): high values mean that the two topics agree on systems effectiveness (and that TREC results would not change by leaving out one of the two topics). (c) if i, j ∈ S, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈T APA(i, k) · APA(j, k) measures how much agreement on the effectiveness of two systems i and j there is over all topics: high values mean that many topics quite agree on the two systems effectiveness; low values single out systems that are somehow controversial, and that need several topics to have a correct effectiveness assessment. (d) if i, j ∈ T, then AT A[i, j] = P k∈S APM(k, i)·APM(k, j) measures how much agreement on the ease of the two topics i and j there is over all systems: high values mean that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease.",
                "Therefore, these matrices are meaningful and somehow interesting.",
                "For instance, the submatrix (b) corresponds to a weighted undirected complete graph, whose nodes are the topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much two topics agree on systems effectiveness.",
                "Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.",
                "It would be interesting to cluster the topics on this graph.",
                "Furthermore, the matrix/graph (a) could be useful in TREC pool formation: systems that do not agree on topic ease would probably find different relevant documents, and should therefore be complementary in pool formation.",
                "Note that no notion of single documents is involved in the above analysis. 6.5 Insights As indicated, the primary contribution of this paper has been a method of analysis.",
                "However, in the course of applying this method to one set of TREC results, we have achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated in Sect. 2: • We confirm Hypothesis 2 above, that some topics are easier than others. • Differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some systems are better than others at distinguishing easy and difficult topics; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 3. • There are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which do badly on some topics generally considered easy but well on some hard topics.",
                "However, on the whole, the more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy and difficult topics.",
                "This is to be expected: a really bad system will do badly on everything, while even a good system may have difficulty with some topics. • Differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some topics are better than others at distinguising more or less effective systems; thus we have some confirmation of Hypothesis 4. • If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at distinguishing more or less effective systems.",
                "As argued in Sect. 5, this is an undesirable property.",
                "GMAP is more balanced.",
                "Clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets.",
                "However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information. 6.6 Selecting topics The confirmation of Hypothesis 4 leads, as indicated, to the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a much smaller set of topics, provided we could select such an appropriate set.",
                "This selection may not be straightforward, however.",
                "It is possible that simply selecting the high hubness topics will achieve this end; however, it is also possible that there are significant interactions between topics which would render such a simple rule ineffective.",
                "This investigation would therefore require serious experimentation.",
                "For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.",
                "This is left for future work. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.",
                "More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.",
                "The normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat generalised.",
                "We note that no such approach to TREC data analysis has been proposed so far.",
                "The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.",
                "Also, it is suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.",
                "Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the topics and all the systems available.",
                "Adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and authority indicators.",
                "Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current TREC methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.",
                "This is an initial work, and further analyses could be performed.",
                "For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.",
                "Other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to PageRank.",
                "It would be interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT A and AAT .",
                "The same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.",
                "Hopefully, further analyses of the graph defined in this paper, according to the approach described, can be insightful for a better understanding of TREC or similar data.",
