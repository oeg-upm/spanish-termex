Roberts [10] showed that it is sufficient for all social choice functions whose domain is unrestricted. Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] proved the sufficiency of weak monotonicity for functions over order-based domains and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] proved sufficiency for order-based domains with range constraints and for domains defined by other special types of linear inequality constraints. Here we show the more general result, conjectured by Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6], that weak monotonicity is sufficient for functions defined on any convex domain.

INTRODUCTION Social choice theory centers around the general problem of selecting a single outcome out of a set A of alternative outcomes based on the individual preferences of a set P of players. A method for aggregating player preferences to select one outcome is called a social choice function. In this paper we assume that the range A is finite and that each players preference is expressed by a valuation function which assigns to each possible outcome a real number representing the benefit the player derives from that outcome. The ensemble of player valuation functions is viewed as a valuation matrix with rows indexed by players and columns by outcomes. A major difficulty connected with social choice functions is that players can not be required to tell the truth about their preferences. Since each player seeks to maximize his own benefit, he may find it in his interest to misrepresent his valuation function. An important approach for dealing with this problem is to augment a given social choice function with a payment function, which assigns to each player a (positive or negative) payment as a function of all of the individual preferences. By carefully choosing the payment function, one can hope to entice each player to tell the truth. A social choice function augmented with a payment function is called a mechanism 1 and the mechanism is said to implement the social choice function. A mechanism is truthful (or to be strategyproof or to have a dominant strategy) if each players best strategy, knowing the preferences of the others, is always to declare his own true preferences. A social choice function is truthfully implementable, or truthful if it has a truthful implementation. (The property of truthful implementability is sometimes called dominant strategy incentive compatibility). This framework leads naturally to the question: which social choice functions are truthful? This question is of the following general type: given a class of functions (here, social choice functions) and a property that holds for some of them (here, truthfulness), characterize the property. The definition of the property itself provides a characterization, so what more is needed? Here are some useful notions of characterization: • Recognition algorithm. Give an algorithm which, given an appropriate representation of a function in the class, determines whether the function has the property. • Parametric representation. Give an explicit parametrized family of functions and show that each function in the 1 The usual definition of mechanism is more general than this (see [8] Chapter 23.C or [9]); the mechanisms we consider here are usually called direct revelation mechanisms. 286 family has the property, and that every function with the property is in the family. A third notion applies in the case of hereditary properties of functions. A function g is a subfunction of function f, or f contains g, if g is obtained by restricting the domain of f. A property P of functions is hereditary if it is preserved under taking subfunctions. Truthfulness is easily seen to be hereditary. • Sets of obstructions. For a hereditary property P, a function g that does not have the property is an obstruction to the property in the sense that any function containing g doesnt have the property. An obstruction is minimal if every proper subfunction has the property. A set of obstructions is complete if every function that does not have the property contains one of them as a subfunction. The set of all functions that dont satisfy P is a complete (but trivial and uninteresting) set of obstructions; one seeks a set of small (ideally, minimal) obstructions. We are not aware of any work on recognition algorithms for the property of truthfulness, but there are significant results concerning parametric representations and obstruction characterizations of truthfulness. It turns out that the domain of the function, i.e., the set of allowed valuation matrices, is crucial. For functions with unrestricted domain, i.e., whose domain is the set of all real matrices, there are very good characterizations of truthfulness. For general domains, however, the picture is far from complete. Typically, the domains of social choice functions are specified by a system of constraints. For example, an order constraint requires that one specified entry in some row be larger than another in the same row, a range constraint places an upper or lower bound on an entry, and a zero constraint forces an entry to be 0. These are all examples of linear inequality constraints on the matrix entries. Building on work of Roberts [10], Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] defined a condition called weak monotonicity (WMON). (Independently, in the context of multi-unit auctions, Bikhchandani, Chatterji and Sen [3] identified the same condition and called it nondecreasing in marginal utilities (NDMU).) The definition of W-MON can be formulated in terms of obstructions: for some specified simple set F of functions each having domains of size 2, a function satisfies W-MON if it contains no function from F. The functions in F are not truthful, and therefore W-MON is a necessary condition for truthfulness. Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] showed that W-MON is also sufficient for truthfulness for social choice functions whose domain is order-based, i.e., defined by order constraints and zero constraints, and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] extended this to other domains. The domain constraints considered in both papers are special cases of linear inequality constraints, and it is natural to ask whether W-MON is sufficient for any domain defined by such constraints. Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] conjectured that W-MON suffices for convex domains. The main result of this paper is an affirmative answer to this conjecture: Theorem 1. For any social choice function having convex domain and finite range, weak monotonicity is necessary and sufficient for truthfulness. Using the interpretation of weak monotonicity in terms of obstructions each having domain size 2, this provides a complete set of minimal obstructions for truthfulness within the class of social choice functions with convex domains. The two hypotheses on the social choice function, that the domain is convex and that the range is finite, can not be omitted as is shown by the examples given in section 7. 1.1 Related Work There is a simple and natural parametrized set of truthful social choice functions called affine maximizers. Roberts [10] showed that for functions with unrestricted domain, every truthful function is an affine maximizer, thus providing a parametrized representation for truthful functions with unrestricted domain. There are many known examples of truthful functions over restricted domains that are not affine maximizers (see [1], [2], [4], [6] and [7]). Each of these examples has a special structure and it seems plausible that there might be some mild restrictions on the class of all social choice functions such that all truthful functions obeying these restrictions are affine maximizers. Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] obtained a result in this direction by showing that for order-based domains, under certain technical assumptions, every truthful social choice function is almost an affine maximizer. There are a number of results about truthfulness that can be viewed as providing obstruction characterizations, although the notion of obstruction is not explicitly discussed. For a player i, a set of valuation matrices is said to be i-local if all of the matrices in the set are identical except for row i. Call a social choice function i-local if its domain is ilocal and call it local if it is i-local for some i. The following easily proved fact is used extensively in the literature: Proposition 2. The social choice function f is truthful if and only if every local subfunction of f is truthful. This implies that the set of all local non-truthful functions comprises a complete set of obstructions for truthfulness. This set is much smaller than the set of all non-truthful functions, but is still far from a minimal set of obstructions. Rochet [11], Rozenshtrom [12] and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] identified a necessary and sufficient condition for truthfulness (see lemma 3 below) called the nonnegative cycle property. This condition can be viewed as providing a minimal complete set of non-truthful functions. As is required by proposition 2, each function in the set is local. Furthermore it is one-to-one. In particular its domain has size at most the number of possible outcomes |A|. As this complete set of obstructions consists of minimal non-truthful functions, this provides the optimal obstruction characterization of non-truthful functions within the class of all social choice functions. But by restricting attention to interesting subclasses of social choice functions, one may hope to get simpler sets of obstructions for truthfulness within that class. The condition of weak monotonicity mentioned earlier can be defined by a set of obstructions, each of which is a local function of domain size exactly 2. Thus the results of Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6], and of Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] give a very simple set of obstructions for truthfulness within certain subclasses of social choice functions. Theorem 1 extends these results to a much larger subclass of functions. 287 1.2 Weak Monotonicity and the Nonnegative Cycle Property By proposition 2, a function is truthful if and only if each of its local subfunctions is truthful. Therefore, to get a set of obstructions for truthfulness, it suffices to obtain such a set for local functions. The domain of an i-local function consists of matrices that are fixed on all rows but row i. Fix such a function f and let D ⊆ RA be the set of allowed choices for row i. Since f depends only on row i and row i is chosen from D, we can view f as a function from D to A. Therefore, f is a social choice function having one player; we refer to such a function as a single player function. Associated to any single player function f with domain D we define an edge-weighted directed graph Hf whose vertex set is the image of f. For convenience, we assume that f is surjective and so this image is A. For each a, b ∈ A, x ∈ f−1 (a) there is an edge ex(a, b) from a to b with weight x(a) − x(b). The weight of a set of edges is just the sum of the weights of the edges. We say that f satisfies: • the nonnegative cycle property if every directed cycle has nonnegative weight. • the nonnegative two-cycle property if every directed cycle between two vertices has nonnegative weight. We say a local function g satisfies nonnegative cycle property/nonnegative two-cycle property if its associated single player function f does. The graph Hf has a possibly infinite number of edges between any two vertices. We define Gf to be the edgeweighted directed graph with exactly one edge from a to b, whose weight δab is the infimum (possibly −∞) of all of the edge weights ex(a, b) for x ∈ f−1 (a). It is easy to see that Hf has the nonnegative cycle property/nonnegative two-cycle property if and only if Gf does. Gf is called the outcome graph of f. The weak monotonicity property mentioned earlier can be defined for arbitrary social choice functions by the condition that every local subfunction satisfies the nonnegative two-cycle property. The following result was obtained by Rochet [11] in a slightly different form and rediscovered by Rozenshtrom [12] and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5]: Lemma 3. A local social choice function is truthful if and only if it has the nonnegative cycle property. Thus a social choice function is truthful if and only if every local subfunction satisfies the nonnegative cycle property. In light of this, theorem 1 follows from: Theorem 4. For any surjective single player function f : D −→ A where D is a convex subset of RA and A is finite, the nonnegative two-cycle property implies the nonnegative cycle property. This is the result we will prove. 1.3 Overview of the Proof of Theorem 4 Let D ⊆ RA be convex and let f : D −→ A be a single player function such that Gf has no negative two-cycles. We want to conclude that Gf has no negative cycles. For two vertices a, b, let δ∗ ab denote the minimum weight of any path from a to b. Clearly δ∗ ab ≤ δab. Our proof shows that the δ∗ -weight of every cycle is exactly 0, from which theorem 4 follows. There seems to be no direct way to compute δ∗ and so we proceed indirectly. Based on geometric considerations, we identify a subset of paths in Gf called admissible paths and a subset of admissible paths called straight paths. We prove that for any two outcomes a, b, there is a straight path from a to b (lemma 8 and corollary 10), and all straight paths from a to b have the same weight, which we denote ρab (theorem 12). We show that ρab ≤ δab (lemma 14) and that the ρ-weight of every cycle is 0. The key step to this proof is showing that the ρ-weight of every directed triangle is 0 (lemma 17). It turns out that ρ is equal to δ∗ (corollary 20), although this equality is not needed in the proof of theorem 4. To expand on the above summary, we give the definitions of an admissible path and a straight path. These are somewhat technical and rely on the geometry of f. We first observe that, without loss of generality, we can assume that D is (topologically) closed (section 2). In section 3, for each a ∈ A, we enlarge the set f−1 (a) to a closed convex set Da ⊆ D in such a way that for a, b ∈ A with a = b, Da and Db have disjoint interiors. We define an admissible path to be a sequence of outcomes (a1, . . . , ak) such that each of the sets Ij = Daj ∩ Daj+1 is nonempty (section 4). An admissible path is straight if there is a straight line that meets one point from each of the sets I1, . . . , Ik−1 in order (section 5). Finally, we mention how the hypotheses of convex domain and finite range are used in the proof. Both hypotheses are needed to show: (1) the existence of a straight path from a to b for all a, b (lemma 8). (2) that the ρ-weight of a directed triangle is 0 (lemma 17). The convex domain hypothesis is also needed for the convexity of the sets Da (section 3). The finite range hypothesis is also needed to reduce theorem 4 to the case that D is closed (section 2) and to prove that every straight path from a to b has the same δ-weight (theorem 12). 2. REDUCTION TO CLOSED DOMAIN We first reduce the theorem to the case that D is closed. Write DC for the closure of D. Since A is finite, DC = ∪a∈A(f−1 (a))C . Thus for each v ∈ DC − D, there is an a = a(v) ∈ A such that v ∈ (f−1 (a))C . Extend f to the function g on DC by defining g(v) = a(v) for v ∈ DC − D and g(v) = f(v) for v ∈ D. It is easy to check that δab(g) = δab(f) for all a, b ∈ A and therefore it suffices to show that the nonnegative two-cycle property for g implies the nonnegative cycle property for g. Henceforth we assume D is convex and closed. 3. A DISSECTION OF THE DOMAIN In this section, we construct a family of closed convex sets {Da : a ∈ A} with disjoint interiors whose union is D and satisfying f−1 (a) ⊆ Da for each a ∈ A. Let Ra = {v : ∀b ∈ A, v(a) − v(b) ≥ δab}. Ra is a closed polyhedron containing f−1 (a). The next proposition implies that any two of these polyhedra intersect only on their boundary. Proposition 5. Let a, b ∈ A. If v ∈ Ra ∩Rb then v(a)− v(b) = δab = −δba. 288 Da Db Dc Dd De v w x y z u p Figure 1: A 2-dimensional domain with 5 outcomes. Proof. v ∈ Ra implies v(a) − v(b) ≥ δab and v ∈ Rb implies v(b)−v(a) ≥ δba which, by the nonnegative two-cycle property, implies v(a) − v(b) ≤ δab. Thus v(a) − v(b) = δab and by symmetry v(b) − v(a) = δba. Finally, we restrict the collection of sets {Ra : a ∈ A} to the domain D by defining Da = Ra ∩ D for each a ∈ A. Clearly, Da is closed and convex, and contains f−1 (a). Therefore S a∈A Da = D. Also, by proposition 5, any point v in Da ∩ Db satisfies v(a) − v(b) = δab = −δba. 4. PATHS AND D-SEQUENCES A path of size k is a sequence −→a = (a1, . . . , ak) with each ai ∈ A (possibly with repetition). We call −→a an (a1, ak)path. For a path −→a , we write |−→a | for the size of −→a . −→a is simple if the ais are distinct. For b, c ∈ A we write Pbc for the set of (b, c)-paths and SPbc for the set of simple (b, c)-paths. The δ-weight of path −→a is defined by δ(−→a ) = k−1X i=1 δaiai+1 . A D-sequence of order k is a sequence −→u = (u0, . . . , uk) with each ui ∈ D (possibly with repetition). We call −→u a (u0, uk)-sequence. For a D-sequence −→u , we write ord(u) for the order of −→u . For v, w ∈ D we write Svw for the set of (v, w)-sequences. A compatible pair is a pair (−→a , −→u ) where −→a is a path and −→u is a D-sequence satisfying ord(−→u ) = |−→a | and for each i ∈ [k], both ui−1 and ui belong to Dai . We write C(−→a ) for the set of D-sequences −→u that are compatible with −→a . We say that −→a is admissible if C(−→a ) is nonempty. For −→u ∈ C(−→a ) we define ∆−→a (−→u ) = |−→a |−1 X i=1 (ui(ai) − ui(ai+1)). For v, w ∈ D and b, c ∈ A, we define Cvw bc to be the set of compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) such that −→a ∈ Pbc and −→u ∈ Svw . To illustrate these definitions, figure 1 gives the dissection of a domain, a 2-dimensional plane, into five regions Da, Db, Dc, Dd, De. D-sequence (v, w, x, y, z) is compatible with both path (a, b, c, e) and path (a, b, d, e); D-sequence (v, w, u, y, z) is compatible with a unique path (a, b, d, e). D-sequence (x, w, p, y, z) is compatible with a unique path (b, a, d, e). Hence (a, b, c, e), (a, b, d, e) and (b, a, d, e) are admissible paths. However, path (a, c, d) or path (b, e) is not admissible. Proposition 6. For any compatible pair (−→a , −→u ), ∆−→a (−→u ) = δ(−→a ). Proof. Let k = ord(−→u ) = |−→a |. By the definition of a compatible pair, ui ∈ Dai ∩ Dai+1 for i ∈ [k − 1]. ui(ai) − ui(ai+1) = δaiai+1 from proposition 5. Therefore, ∆−→a (−→u ) = k−1X i=1 (ui(ai) − ui(ai+1)) = k−1X i=1 δaiai+1 = δ(−→a ). Lemma 7. Let b, c ∈ A and let −→a , −→a ∈ Pbc. If C(−→a ) ∩ C(−→a ) = ∅ then δ(−→a ) = δ(−→a ). Proof. Let −→u be a D-sequence in C(−→a ) ∩ C(−→a ). By proposition 6, δ(−→a ) = ∆−→a (−→u ) and δ(−→a ) = ∆−→a (−→u ), it suffices to show ∆−→a (−→u ) = ∆−→a (−→u ). Let k = ord(−→u ) = |−→a | = |−→a |. Since ∆−→a (−→u ) = k−1X i=1 (ui(ai) − ui(ai+1)) = u1(a1) + k−1X i=2 (ui(ai) − ui−1(ai)) − uk−1(ak) = u1(b) + k−1X i=2 (ui(ai) − ui−1(ai)) − uk−1(c), ∆−→a (−→u ) − ∆−→a (−→u ) = k−1X i=2 ((ui(ai) − ui−1(ai)) − (ui(ai) − ui−1(ai))) = k−1X i=2 ((ui(ai) − ui(ai)) − (ui−1(ai) − ui−1(ai))). Noticing both ui−1 and ui belong to Dai ∩ Dai , we have by proposition 5 ui−1(ai) − ui−1(ai) = δaiai = ui(ai) − ui(ai). Hence ∆−→a (−→u ) − ∆−→a (−→u ) = 0. 5. LINEAR D-SEQUENCES AND STRAIGHT PATHS For v, w ∈ D we write vw for the (closed) line segment joining v and w. A D-sequence −→u of order k is linear provided that there is a sequence of real numbers 0 = λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤ . . . ≤ λk = 1 such that ui = (1 − λi)u0 + λiuk. In particular, each ui belongs to u0uk. For v, w ∈ D we write Lvw for the set of linear (v, w)-sequences. For b, c ∈ A and v, w ∈ D we write LCvw bc for the set of compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) such that −→a ∈ Pbc and −→u ∈ Lvw . For a path −→a , we write L(−→a ) for the set of linear sequences compatible with −→a . We say that −→a is straight if L(−→a ) = ∅. For example, in figure 1, D-sequence (v, w, x, y, z) is linear while (v, w, u, y, z), (x, w, p, y, z), and (x, v, w, y, z) are not. Hence path (a, b, c, e) and (a, b, d, e) are both straight. However, path (b, a, d, e) is not straight. 289 Lemma 8. Let b, c ∈ A and v ∈ Db, w ∈ Dc. There is a simple path −→a and D-sequence −→u such that (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc . Furthermore, for any such path −→a , δ(−→a ) ≤ v(b) − v(c). Proof. By the convexity of D, any sequence of points on vw is a D-sequence. If b = c, singleton path −→a = (b) and D-sequence −→u = (v, w) are obviously compatible. δ(−→a ) = 0 = v(b) − v(c). So assume b = c. If Db ∩Dc ∩vw = ∅, we pick an arbitrary x from this set and let −→a = (b, c) ∈ SPbc, −→u = (v, x, w) ∈ Lvw . Again it is easy to check the compatibility of (−→a , −→u ). Since v ∈ Db, v(b) − v(c) ≥ δbc = δ(−→a ). For the remaining case b = c and Db ∩Dc ∩vw = ∅, notice v = w otherwise v = w ∈ Db ∩ Dc ∩ vw. So we can define λx for every point x on vw to be the unique number in [0, 1] such that x = (1 − λx)v + λxw. For convenience, we write x ≤ y for λx ≤ λy. Let Ia = Da ∩ vw for each a ∈ A. Since D = ∪a∈ADa, we have vw = ∪a∈AIa. Moreover, by the convexity of Da and vw, Ia is a (possibly trivial) closed interval. We begin by considering the case that Ib and Ic are each a single point, that is, Ib = {v} and Ic = {w}. Let S be a minimal subset of A satisfying ∪s∈SIs = vw. For each s ∈ S, Is is maximal, i.e., not contained in any other It, for t ∈ S. In particular, the intervals {Is : s ∈ S} have all left endpoints distinct and all right endpoints distinct and the order of the left endpoints is the same as that of the right endpoints. Let k = |S| + 2 and index S as a2, . . . , ak−1 in the order defined by the right endpoints. Denote the interval Iai by [li, ri]. Thus l2 < l3 < . . . < lk−1, r2 < r3 < . . . < rk−1 and the fact that these intervals cover vw implies l2 = v, rk−1 = w and for all 2 ≤ i ≤ k − 2, li+1 ≤ ri which further implies li < ri. Now we define the path −→a = (a1, a2, . . . , ak−1, ak) with a1 = b, ak = c and a2, a3, . . . , ak−1 as above. Define the linear D-sequence −→u = (u0, u1, . . . , uk) by u0 = u1 = v, uk = w and for 2 ≤ i ≤ k−1, ui = ri. It follows immediately that (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc . Neither b nor c is in S since lb = rb and lc = rc. Thus −→a is simple. Finally to show δ(−→a ) ≤ v(b) − v(c), we note v(b) − v(c) = v(a1) − v(ak) = k−1X i=1 (v(ai) − v(ai+1)) and δ(−→a ) = ∆−→a (−→u ) = k−1X i=1 (ui(ai) − ui(ai+1)) = v(a1) − v(a2) + k−1X i=2 (ri(ai) − ri(ai+1)). For two outcomes d, e ∈ A, let us define fde(z) = z(d)−z(e) for all z ∈ D. It suffices to show faiai+1 (ri) ≤ faiai+1 (v) for 2 ≤ i ≤ k − 1. Fact 9. For d, e ∈ A, fde(z) is a linear function of z. Furthermore, if x ∈ Dd and y ∈ De with x = y, then fde(x) = x(d) − x(e) ≥ δde ≥ −δed ≥ −(y(e) − y(d)) = fde(y). Therefore fde(z) is monotonically nonincreasing along the line ←→ xy as z moves in the direction from x to y. Applying this fact with d = ai, e = ai+1, x = li and y = ri gives the desired conclusion. This completes the proof for the case that Ib = {v} and Ic = {w}. For general Ib, Ic, rb < lc otherwise Db ∩ Dc ∩ vw = Ib ∩ Ic = ∅. Let v = rb and w = lc. Clearly we can apply the above conclusion to v ∈ Db, w ∈ Dc and get a compatible pair (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCv w bc with −→a simple and δ(−→a ) ≤ v (b) − v (c). Define the linear D-sequence −→u by u0 = v, uk = w and ui = ui for i ∈ [k − 1]. (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc is evident. Moreover, applying the above fact with d = b, e = c, x = v and y = w, we get v(b) − v(c) ≥ v (b) − v (c) ≥ δ(−→a ). Corollary 10. For any b, c ∈ A there is a straight (b, c)path. The main result of this section (theorem 12) says that for any b, c ∈ A, every straight (b, c)-path has the same δ-weight. To prove this, we first fix v ∈ Db and w ∈ Dc and show (lemma 11) that every straight (b, c)-path compatible with some linear (v, w)-sequence has the same δ-weight ρbc(v, w). We then show in theorem 12 that ρbc(v, w) is the same for all choices of v ∈ Db and w ∈ Dc. Lemma 11. For b, c ∈ A, there is a function ρbc : Db × Dc −→ R satisfying that for any (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc , δ(−→a ) = ρbc(v, w). Proof. Let (−→a , −→u ), (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc . It suffices to show δ(−→a ) = δ(−→a ). To do this we construct a linear (v, w)-sequence −→u and paths −→a ∗ , −→a ∗∗ ∈ Pbc, both compatible with −→u , satisfying δ(−→a ∗ ) = δ(−→a ) and δ(−→a ∗∗ ) = δ(−→a ). Lemma 7 implies δ(−→a ∗ ) = δ(−→a ∗∗ ), which will complete the proof. Let |−→a | = ord(−→u ) = k and |−→a | = ord(−→u ) = l. We select −→u to be any linear (v, w)-sequence (u0, u1, . . . , ut) such that −→u and −→u are both subsequences of −→u , i.e., there are indices 0 = i0 < i1 < · · · < ik = t and 0 = j0 < j1 < · · · < jl = t such that −→u = (ui0 , ui1 , . . . , uik ) and −→u = (uj0 , uj1 , . . . , ujl ). We now construct a (b, c)-path −→a ∗ compatible with −→u such that δ(−→a ∗ ) = δ(−→a ). (An analogous construction gives −→a ∗∗ compatible with −→u such that δ(−→a ∗∗ ) = δ(−→a ).) This will complete the proof. −→a ∗ is defined as follows: for 1 ≤ j ≤ t, a∗ j = ar where r is the unique index satisfying ir−1 < j ≤ ir. Since both uir−1 = ur−1 and uir = ur belong to Dar , uj ∈ Dar for ir−1 ≤ j ≤ ir by the convexity of Dar . The compatibility of (−→a ∗ , −→u ) follows immediately. Clearly, a∗ 1 = a1 = b and a∗ t = ak = c, so −→a ∗ ∈ Pbc. Furthermore, as δa∗ j a∗ j+1 = δarar = 0 for each r ∈ [k], ir−1 < j < ir, δ(−→a ∗ ) = k−1X r=1 δa∗ ir a∗ ir+1 = k−1X r=1 δarar+1 = δ(−→a ). We are now ready for the main theorem of the section: Theorem 12. ρbc is a constant map on Db × Dc. Thus for any b, c ∈ A, every straight (b, c)-path has the same δweight. Proof. For a path −→a , (v, w) is compatible with −→a if there is a linear (v, w)-sequence compatible with −→a . We write CP(−→a ) for the set of pairs (v, w) compatible with −→a . ρbc is constant on CP(−→a ) because for each (v, w) ∈ CP(−→a ), ρbc(v, w) = δ(−→a ). By lemma 8, we also haveS −→a ∈SPbc CP(−→a ) = Db ×Dc. Since A is finite, SPbc, the set of simple paths from b to c, is finite as well. 290 Next we prove that for any path −→a , CP(−→a ) is closed. Let ((vn , wn ) : n ∈ N) be a convergent sequence in CP(−→a ) and let (v, w) be the limit. We want to show that (v, w) ∈ CP(−→a ). For each n ∈ N, since (vn , wn ) ∈ CP(−→a ), there is a linear (vn , wn )-sequence un compatible with −→a , i.e., there are 0 = λn 0 ≤ λn 1 ≤ . . . ≤ λn k = 1 (k = |−→a |) such that un j = (1 − λn j )vn + λn j wn (j = 0, 1, . . . , k). Since for each n, λn = (λn 0 , λn 1 , . . . , λn k ) belongs to the closed bounded set [0, 1]k+1 we can choose an infinite subset I ⊆ N such that the sequence (λn : n ∈ I) converges. Let λ = (λ0, λ1, . . . , λk) be the limit. Clearly 0 = λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤ · · · ≤ λk = 1. Define the linear (v, w)-sequence −→u by uj = (1 − λj )v + λj w (j = 0, 1, . . . , k). Then for each j ∈ {0, . . . , k}, uj is the limit of the sequence (un j : n ∈ I). For j > 0, each un j belongs to the closed set Daj , so uj ∈ Daj . Similarly, for j < k each un j belongs to the closed set Daj+1 , so uj ∈ Daj+1 . Hence (−→a , −→u ) is compatible, implying (v, w) ∈ CP(−→a ). Now we have Db × Dc covered by finitely many closed subsets on each of them ρbc is a constant. Suppose for contradiction that there are (v, w), (v , w ) ∈ Db × Dc such that ρbc(v, w) = ρbc(v , w ). L = {((1 − λ)v + λv , (1 − λ)w + λw ) : λ ∈ [0, 1]} is a line segment in Db ×Dc by the convexity of Db, Dc. Let L1 = {(x, y) ∈ L : ρbc(x, y) = ρbc(v, w)} and L2 = L − L1. Clearly (v, w) ∈ L1, (v , w ) ∈ L2. Let P = {−→a ∈ SPbc : δ(−→a ) = ρbc(v, w)}. L1 = `S −→a ∈P CP(−→a ) ´ ∩ L, L2 = S −→a ∈SPbc−P CP(−→a ) ∩ L are closed by the finiteness of P. This is a contradiction, since it is well known (and easy to prove) that a line segment can not be expressed as the disjoint union of two nonempty closed sets. Summarizing corollary 10, lemma 11 and theorem 12, we have Corollary 13. For any b, c ∈ A, there is a real number ρbc with the property that (1) There is at least one straight (b, c)-path of δ-weight ρbc and (2) Every straight (b, c)-path has δ-weight ρbc. 6. PROOF OF THEOREM 4 Lemma 14. ρbc ≤ δbc for all b, c ∈ A. Proof. For contradiction, suppose ρbc − δbc = > 0. By the definition of δbc, there exists v ∈ f−1 (b) ⊆ Db with v(b) − v(c) < δbc + = ρbc. Pick an arbitrary w ∈ Dc. By lemma 8, there is a compatible pair (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc with δ(−→a ) ≤ v(b) − v(c). Since −→a is a straight (b, c)-path, ρbc = δ(−→a ) ≤ v(b) − v(c), leading to a contradiction. Define another edge-weighted complete directed graph Gf on vertex set A where the weight of arc (a, b) is ρab. Immediately from lemma 14, the weight of every directed cycle in Gf is bounded below by its weight in Gf . To prove theorem 4, it suffices to show the zero cycle property of Gf , i.e., every directed cycle has weight zero. We begin by considering two-cycles. Lemma 15. ρbc + ρcb = 0 for all b, c ∈ A. Proof. Let −→a be a straight (b, c)-path compatible with linear sequence −→u . let −→a be the reverse of −→a and −→u the reverse of −→u . Obviously, (−→a , −→u ) is compatible as well and thus −→a is a straight (c, b)-path. Therefore, ρbc + ρcb = δ(−→a ) + δ(−→a ) = k−1X i=1 δaiai+1 + k−1X i=1 δai+1ai = k−1X i=1 (δaiai+1 + δai+1ai ) = 0, where the final equality uses proposition 5. Next, for three cycles, we first consider those compatible with linear triples. Lemma 16. If there are collinear points u ∈ Da, v ∈ Db, w ∈ Dc (a, b, c ∈ A), ρab + ρbc + ρca = 0. Proof. First, we prove for the case where v is between u and w. From lemma 8, there are compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCuv ab , (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc . Let |−→a | = ord(−→u ) = k and |−→a | = ord(−→u ) = l. We paste −→a and −→a together as −→a = (a = a1, a2, . . . , ak−1, ak, a1 , . . . , al = c), −→u and −→u as −→u = (u = u0, u1, . . . , uk = v = u0 , u1 , . . . , ul = w). Clearly (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCuw ac and δ(−→a ) = k−1X i=1 δaiai+1 + δak a1 + l−1X i=1 δai ai+1 = δ(−→a ) + δbb + δ(−→a ) = δ(−→a ) + δ(−→a ). Therefore, ρac = δ(−→a ) = δ(−→a ) + δ(−→a ) = ρab + ρbc. Moreover, ρac = −ρca by lemma 15, so we get ρab + ρbc + ρca = 0. Now suppose w is between u and v. By the above argument, we have ρac + ρcb + ρba = 0 and by lemma 15, ρab + ρbc + ρca = −ρba − ρcb − ρac = 0. The case that u is between v and w is similar. Now we are ready for the zero three-cycle property: Lemma 17. ρab + ρbc + ρca = 0 for all a, b, c ∈ A. Proof. Let S = {(a, b, c) : ρab + ρbc + ρca = 0} and for contradiction, suppose S = ∅. S is finite. For each a ∈ A, choose va ∈ Da arbitrarily and let T be the convex hull of {va : a ∈ A}. For each (a, b, c) ∈ S, let Rabc = Da × Db × Dc ∩ T3 . Clearly, each Rabc is nonempty and compact. Moreover, by lemma 16, no (u, v, w) ∈ Rabc is collinear. Define f : D3 → R by f(u, v, w) = |v−u|+|w−v|+|u−w|. For (a, b, c) ∈ S, the restriction of f to the compact set Rabc attains a minimum m(a, b, c) at some point (u, v, w) ∈ Rabc by the continuity of f, i.e., there exists a triangle ∆uvw of minimum perimeter within T with u ∈ Da, v ∈ Db, w ∈ Dc. Choose (a∗ , b∗ , c∗ ) ∈ S so that m(a∗ , b∗ , c∗ ) is minimum and let (u∗ , v∗ , w∗ ) ∈ Ra∗b∗c∗ be a triple achieving it. Pick an arbitrary point p in the interior of ∆u∗ v∗ w∗ . By the convexity of domain D, there is d ∈ A such that p ∈ Dd. 291 Consider triangles ∆u∗ pw∗ , ∆w∗ pv∗ and ∆v∗ pu∗ . Since each of them has perimeter less than that of ∆u∗ v∗ w∗ and all three triangles are contained in T, by the minimality of ∆u∗ v∗ w∗ , (a∗ , d, c∗ ), (c∗ , d, b∗ ), (b∗ , d, a∗ ) ∈ S. Thus ρa∗d + ρdc∗ + ρc∗a∗ = 0, ρc∗d + ρdb∗ + ρb∗c∗ = 0, ρb∗d + ρda∗ + ρa∗b∗ = 0. Summing up the three equalities, (ρa∗d + ρdc∗ + ρc∗d + ρdb∗ + ρb∗d + ρda∗ ) +(ρc∗a∗ + ρb∗c∗ + ρa∗b∗ ) = 0, which yields a contradiction ρa∗b∗ + ρb∗c∗ + ρc∗a∗ = 0. With the zero two-cycle and three-cycle properties, the zero cycle property of Gf is immediate. As noted earlier, this completes the proof of theorem 4. Theorem 18. Every directed cycle of Gf has weight zero. Proof. Clearly, zero two-cycle and three-cycle properties imply triangle equality ρab +ρbc = ρac for all a, b, c ∈ A. For a directed cycle C = a1a2 . . . aka1, by inductively applying triangle equality, we have Pk−1 i=1 ρaiai+1 = ρa1ak . Therefore, the weight of C is k−1X i=1 ρaiai+1 + ρaka1 = ρa1ak + ρaka1 = 0. As final remarks, we note that our result implies the following strengthenings of theorem 12: Corollary 19. For any b, c ∈ A, every admissible (b, c)path has the same δ-weight ρbc. Proof. First notice that for any b, c ∈ A, if Db ∩Dc = ∅, δbc = ρbc. To see this, pick v ∈ Db ∩ Dc arbitrarily. Obviously, path −→a = (b, c) is compatible with linear sequence −→u = (v, v, v) and is thus a straight (b, c)-path. Hence ρbc = δ(−→a ) = δbc. Now for any b, c ∈ A and any (b, c)-path −→a with C(−→a ) = ∅, let −→u ∈ C(−→a ). Since ui ∈ Dai ∩ Dai+1 for i ∈ [|−→a | − 1], δ(−→a ) = |−→a |−1 X i=1 δaiai+1 = |−→a |−1 X i=1 ρaiai+1 , which by theorem 18, = −ρa|−→a |a1 = ρa1a|−→a | = ρbc. Corollary 20. For any b, c ∈ A, ρbc is equal to δ∗ bc, the minimum δ-weight over all (b, c)-paths. Proof. Clearly ρbc ≥ δ∗ bc by corollary 13. On the other hand, for every (b, c)-path −→a = (b = a1, a2, . . . , ak = c), by lemma 14, δ(−→a ) = k−1X i=1 δaiai+1 ≥ k−1X i=1 ρaiai+1 , which by theorem 18, = −ρaka1 = ρa1ak = ρbc. Hence ρbc ≤ δ∗ bc, which completes the proof. 7. COUNTEREXAMPLES TO STRONGER FORMS OF THEOREM 4 Theorem 4 applies to social choice functions with convex domain and finite range. We now show that neither of these hypotheses can be omitted. Our examples are single player functions. The first example illustrates that convexity can not be omitted. We present an untruthful single player social choice function with three outcomes a, b, c satisfying W-MON on a path-connected but non-convex domain. The domain is the boundary of a triangle whose vertices are x = (0, 1, −1), y = (−1, 0, 1) and z = (1, −1, 0). x and the open line segment zx is assigned outcome a, y and the open line segment xy is assigned outcome b, and z and the open line segment yz is assigned outcome c. Clearly, δab = −δba = δbc = −δcb = δca = −δac = −1, W-MON (the nonnegative twocycle property) holds. Since there is a negative cycle δab + δbc + δca = −3, by lemma 3, this is not a truthful choice function. We now show that the hypothesis of finite range can not be omitted. We construct a family of single player social choice functions each having a convex domain and an infinite number of outcomes, and satisfying weak monotonicity but not truthfulness. Our examples will be specified by a positive integer n and an n × n matrix M satisfying the following properties: (1) M is non-singular. (2) M is positive semidefinite. (3) There are distinct i1, i2, . . . , ik ∈ [n] satisfying k−1X j=1 (M(ij, ij) − M(ij , ij+1)) + (M(ik, ik) − M(ik, i1)) < 0. Here is an example matrix with n = 3 and (i1, i2, i3) = (1, 2, 3): 0 @ 0 1 −1 −1 0 1 1 −1 0 1 A Let e1, e2, . . . , en denote the standard basis of Rn . Let Sn denote the convex hull of {e1, e2 . . . , en}, which is the set of vectors in Rn with nonnegative coordinates that sum to 1. The range of our social choice function will be the set Sn and the domain D will be indexed by Sn, that is D = {yλ : λ ∈ Sn}, where yλ is defined below. The function f maps yλ to λ. Next we specify yλ. By definition, D must be a set of functions from Sn to R. For λ ∈ Sn, the domain element yλ : Sn −→ R is defined by yλ(α) = λT Mα. The nonsingularity of M guarantees that yλ = yµ for λ = µ ∈ Sn. It is easy to see that D is a convex subset of the set of all functions from Sn to R. The outcome graph Gf is an infinite graph whose vertex set is the outcome set A = Sn. For outcomes λ, µ ∈ A, the edge weight δλµ is equal to δλµ = inf{v(λ) − v(µ) : f(v) = λ} = yλ(λ) − yλ(µ) = λT Mλ − λT Mµ = λT M(λ − µ). We claim that Gf satisfies the nonnegative two-cycle property (W-MON) but has a negative cycle (and hence is not truthful). For outcomes λ, µ ∈ A, δλµ +δµλ = λT M(λ−µ)+µT M(µ−λ) = (λ−µ)T M(λ−µ), 292 which is nonnegative since M is positive semidefinite. Hence the nonnegative two-cycle property holds. Next we show that Gf has a negative cycle. Let i1, i2, . . . , ik be a sequence of indices satisfying property 3 of M. We claim ei1 ei2 . . . eik ei1 is a negative cycle. Since δeiej = eT i M(ei − ej) = M(i, i) − M(i, j) for any i, j ∈ [k], the weight of the cycle k−1X j=1 δeij eij+1 + δeik ei1 = k−1X j=1 (M(ij , ij ) − M(ij, ij+1)) + (M(ik, ik) − M(ik, i1)) < 0, which completes the proof. Finally, we point out that the third property imposed on the matrix M has the following interpretation. Let R(M) = {r1, r2, . . . , rn} be the set of row vectors of M and let hM be the single player social choice function with domain R(M) and range {1, 2, . . . , n} mapping ri to i. Property 3 is equivalent to the condition that the outcome graph GhM has a negative cycle. By lemma 3, this is equivalent to the condition that hM is untruthful. 8. FUTURE WORK As stated in the introduction, the goal underlying the work in this paper is to obtain useful and general characterizations of truthfulness. Let us say that a set D of P × A real valuation matrices is a WM-domain if any social choice function on D satisfying weak monotonicity is truthful. In this paper, we showed that for finite A, any convex D is a WM-domain. Typically, the domains of social choice functions considered in mechanism design are convex, but there are interesting examples with non-convex domains, e.g., combinatorial auctions with unknown single-minded bidders. It is intriguing to find the most general conditions under which a set D of real matrices is a WM-domain. We believe that convexity is the main part of the story, i.e., a WM-domain is, after excluding some exceptional cases, essentially a convex set. Turning to parametric representations, let us say a set D of P × A matrices is an AM-domain if any truthful social choice function with domain D is an affine maximizer. Roberts theorem says that the unrestricted domain is an AM-domain. What are the most general conditions under which a set D of real matrices is an AM-domain?

Introducción La teoría de la elección social se centra en el problema general de seleccionar un solo resultado de un conjunto A de resultados alternativos basados en las preferencias individuales de un conjunto P de jugadores. Un método para agregar preferencias de jugadores para seleccionar un resultado se llama función de elección social. En este documento, suponemos que el rango A es finito y que la preferencia de cada jugador se expresa mediante una función de valoración que asigna a cada resultado posible un número real que representa el beneficio que el jugador deriva de ese resultado. El conjunto de las funciones de valoración del jugador se ve como una matriz de valoración con filas indexada por jugadores y columnas por resultados. Una gran dificultad relacionada con las funciones de elección social es que los jugadores no pueden ser requeridos para decir la verdad sobre sus preferencias. Dado que cada jugador busca maximizar su propio beneficio, puede encontrar en su interés tergiversar su función de valoración. Un enfoque importante para tratar este problema es aumentar una función de elección social dada con una función de pago, que asigna a cada jugador un pago (positivo o negativo) en función de todas las preferencias individuales. Al elegir cuidadosamente la función de pago, uno puede esperar atraer a cada jugador a decir la verdad. Una función de elección social aumentada con una función de pago se denomina mecanismo 1 y se dice que el mecanismo implementa la función de elección social. Un mecanismo es veraz (o para ser a prueba de estrategias o tener una estrategia dominante) si cada uno de los jugadores la mejor estrategia, conocer las preferencias de los demás, siempre es declarar sus propias verdaderas preferencias. Una función de elección social es sinceramente implementable o sincera si tiene una implementación veraz.(La propiedad de la implementación veraz a veces se llama compatibilidad de incentivos de estrategia dominante). Este marco lleva naturalmente a la pregunta: ¿Qué funciones de elección social son veraz? Esta pregunta es del siguiente tipo general: dada una clase de funciones (aquí, funciones de elección social) y una propiedad que es válida para algunos de ellos (aquí, veracidad), caracterizan la propiedad. La definición de la propiedad en sí proporciona una caracterización, entonces, ¿qué más se necesita? Aquí hay algunas nociones útiles de caracterización: • Algoritmo de reconocimiento. Dé un algoritmo que, dada una representación apropiada de una función en la clase, determine si la función tiene la propiedad.• Representación paramétrica. Dé una familia de funciones parametrizada explícita y muestre que cada función en la definición habitual de mecanismo es más general que esto (ver [8] Capítulo 23.C o [9]);Los mecanismos que consideramos aquí generalmente se llaman mecanismos de revelación directa.286 La familia tiene la propiedad, y que cada función con la propiedad está en la familia. Una tercera noción se aplica en el caso de las propiedades hereditarias de las funciones. Una función G es una subfunción de la función F, o F contiene G, si G se obtiene restringiendo el dominio de f.Una propiedad P de funciones es hereditaria si se conserva bajo subfunciones. La veracidad se ve fácilmente como hereditaria.• Conjuntos de obstrucciones. Para una propiedad hereditaria P, una función G que no tiene la propiedad es una obstrucción a la propiedad en el sentido de que cualquier función que contenga G no tenga la propiedad. Una obstrucción es mínima si cada subfunción adecuada tiene la propiedad. Se completa un conjunto de obstrucciones si cada función que no tiene la propiedad contiene una de ellas como subfunción. El conjunto de todas las funciones que no satisfacen P es un conjunto completo (pero trivial y poco interesante) de obstrucciones;Uno busca un conjunto de pequeñas obstrucciones (idealmente mínimas). No conocemos ningún trabajo sobre algoritmos de reconocimiento para la propiedad de la veracidad, pero hay resultados significativos sobre representaciones paramétricas y caracterizaciones de obstrucción de la veracidad. Resulta que el dominio de la función, es decir, el conjunto de matrices de valoración permitidas, es crucial. Para funciones con dominio sin restricciones, es decir, cuyo dominio es el conjunto de todas las matrices reales, hay muy buenas caracterizaciones de veracidad. Para los dominios generales, sin embargo, la imagen está lejos de ser completa. Típicamente, los dominios de las funciones de elección social se especifican mediante un sistema de restricciones. Por ejemplo, una restricción de orden requiere que una entrada especificada en alguna fila sea mayor que otra en la misma fila, una restricción de rango coloca un límite superior o inferior en una entrada, y una restricción cero obliga a una entrada a ser 0. Todos estos son ejemplos de restricciones de desigualdad lineal en las entradas de matriz. Sobre el trabajo de Roberts [10], Lavi, Mualem y Nisan [6] definieron una condición llamada monotonicidad débil (WMON).(Independientemente, en el contexto de subastas de múltiples unidades, Bikhchandani, Chatterji y Sen [3] identificaron la misma condición y la llamaron no decorativa en los servicios marginales (NDMU)). La definición de W-Mon se puede formular en términos de obstrucciones: para algunos conjuntos simples especificados de funciones que tienen dominios de tamaño 2, una función satisface W-Mon si no contiene ninguna función de F. Las funciones en F no son veraces, y por lo tanto W-mon es una condición necesaria para la veracidad. Lavi, Mualem y Nisan [6] mostraron que W-Mon también es suficiente para la veracidad para las funciones de elección social cuyo dominio se basa en orden, es decir, definido por limitaciones de orden y cero limitaciones, y GUI, Muller y Vohra [5] extendieron estoa otros dominios. Las restricciones de dominio consideradas en ambos documentos son casos especiales de restricciones de desigualdad lineal, y es natural preguntar si W-Mon es suficiente para cualquier dominio definido por tales restricciones. Lavi, Mualem y Nisan [6] conjeturaron que W-Mon es suficiente para dominios convexos. El resultado principal de este documento es una respuesta afirmativa a esta conjetura: el Teorema 1. Para cualquier función de elección social que tenga dominio convexo y rango finito, la monotonicidad débil es necesaria y suficiente para la veracidad. Utilizando la interpretación de la monotonicidad débil en términos de obstrucciones, cada una con el tamaño del dominio 2, esto proporciona un conjunto completo de obstrucciones mínimas para la veracidad dentro de la clase de funciones de elección social con dominios convexos. Las dos hipótesis en la función de elección social, que el dominio es convexo y que el rango es finito, no se puede omitir como lo demuestran los ejemplos dados en la Sección 7. 1.1 Trabajo relacionado Existe un conjunto parametrizado simple y natural de social sinceroFunciones de elección llamadas maximizadores afines. Roberts [10] demostró que para las funciones con dominio sin restricciones, cada función veraz es un maximizador afine, proporcionando así una representación parametrizada para funciones veraz con dominio sin restricciones. Hay muchos ejemplos conocidos de funciones veraz sobre dominios restringidos que no son maximizadores afines (ver [1], [2], [4], [6] y [7]). Cada uno de estos ejemplos tiene una estructura especial y parece plausible que pueda haber algunas restricciones leves en la clase de todas las funciones de elección social, de modo que todas las funciones veraces que obedecen estas restricciones son maximizadores afines. Lavi, Mualem y Nisan [6] obtuvieron un resultado en esta dirección al mostrar que para los dominios basados en pedidos, bajo ciertos supuestos técnicos, cada función de elección social veraz es casi un maximizador afine. Hay una serie de resultados sobre la veracidad que pueden verse como proporcionando caracterizaciones de obstrucción, aunque la noción de obstrucción no se discute explícitamente. Para un jugador I, se dice que un conjunto de matrices de valoración es I-Local si todas las matrices en el conjunto son idénticas, excepto para la fila I. Llame a una función de elección social i-Local si su dominio es ilocal y llámalo local si es i-Local para algunos i. El siguiente hecho fácilmente probado se usa ampliamente en la literatura: Proposición 2. La función de elección social F es veraz si y solo si cada subfunción local de F es sincera. Esto implica que el conjunto de todas las funciones locales no trutales comprende un conjunto completo de obstrucciones para la veracidad. Este conjunto es mucho más pequeño que el conjunto de todas las funciones no justas, pero aún está lejos de ser un conjunto mínimo de obstrucciones. Rochet [11], Rozenshtrom [12] y GUI, Muller y Vohra [5] identificaron una condición necesaria y suficiente para la veracidad (ver Lema 3 a continuación) llamada propiedad del ciclo no negativo. Esta condición puede verse como un conjunto mínimo completo de funciones no trutales. Como lo requiere la Proposición 2, cada función en el conjunto es local. Además, es uno a uno. En particular, su dominio tiene tamaño como máximo el número de resultados posibles | a |. Como este conjunto completo de obstrucciones consiste en funciones mínimas no juzgadas, esto proporciona la caracterización de obstrucción óptima de las funciones no justa dentro de la clase de todas las funciones de elección social. Pero al restringir la atención a subclases interesantes de funciones de elección social, uno puede esperar obtener conjuntos más simples de obstrucciones para la veracidad dentro de esa clase. La condición de la monotonicidad débil mencionada anteriormente puede definirse mediante un conjunto de obstrucciones, cada una de las cuales es una función local del tamaño del dominio exactamente 2. Así, los resultados de Lavi, Mualem y Nisan [6], y de GUI, Muller y Vohra [5] dan un conjunto muy simple de obstrucciones para la veracidad dentro de ciertas subclases de funciones de elección social. El Teorema 1 extiende estos resultados a una subclase mucho más grande de funciones.287 1.2 Monotonicidad débil y la propiedad del ciclo no negativo por la Proposición 2, una función es veraz si y solo si cada una de sus subfunciones locales es sincera. Por lo tanto, para obtener un conjunto de obstrucciones para la veracidad, es suficiente obtener tal conjunto para las funciones locales. El dominio de una función Local consta de matrices que se fijan en todas las filas pero la fila i. Corrige dicha función f y deja que d ⊆ ra sea el conjunto de opciones permitidas para la fila I. Dado que F depende solo de la fila I y la fila I de D, podemos ver F como una función de D a A. Por lo tanto, F es una función de elección social que tiene un jugador;Nos referimos a dicha función como una función para un solo jugador. Asociado a cualquier función de un solo reproductor F con el dominio D, definimos un gráfico dirigido por el borde HF cuyo conjunto de vértices es la imagen de f.Por conveniencia, suponemos que F es Surjetivo y, por lo tanto, esta imagen es A. Para cada a, b ∈ A, x ∈ F - 1 (a) hay un borde ex (a, b) de a a b con peso x (a) - x (b). El peso de un conjunto de bordes es solo la suma de los pesos de los bordes. Decimos que F satisface: • La propiedad del ciclo no negativo si cada ciclo dirigido tiene un peso no negativo.• La propiedad no negativa de dos ciclos si cada ciclo dirigido entre dos vértices tiene un peso no negativo. Decimos que una función local G satisface la propiedad del ciclo no negativo/propiedad no negativa de dos ciclos si su función de jugador individual asociada F sí. El gráfico HF tiene un número posiblemente infinito de bordes entre dos vértices. Definimos que GF es el gráfico dirigido con vergüenza con el borde con exactamente un borde de A a B, cuyo peso ΔAb es el infimum (posiblemente −∞) de todos los pesos de borde ex (a, b) para x ∈ F - 1 (a). Es fácil ver que HF tiene la propiedad del ciclo no negativo/propiedad no negativa de dos ciclos si y solo si GF lo hace. GF se llama gráfico de resultados de f.La propiedad de monotonicidad débil mencionada anteriormente se puede definir para las funciones arbitrarias de elección social con la condición de que cada subfunción local satisfaga la propiedad no negativa de dos ciclos. El siguiente resultado fue obtenido por Rochet [11] en una forma ligeramente diferente y redescubierto por Rozenshtrom [12] y GUI, Muller y Vohra [5]: Lemma 3. Una función de elección social local es veraz si y solo si tiene la propiedad del ciclo no negativo. Por lo tanto, una función de elección social es sincera si y solo si cada subfunción local satisface la propiedad del ciclo no negativo. A la luz de esto, el Teorema 1 sigue del: Teorema 4. Para cualquier función de un solo reproductor Surjetivo F: D-→ A donde D es un subconjunto convexo de RA y A es finita, la propiedad no negativa de dos ciclos implica la propiedad del ciclo no negativo. Este es el resultado que demostraremos.1.3 Descripción general de la prueba del teorema 4 Sea D ⊆ RA convexa y Sea F: D-→ A ser una función de solo reproductor, de modo que GF no tiene dos ciclos negativos. Queremos concluir que GF no tiene ciclos negativos. Para dos vértices A, B, deje que δ ∗ ab denote el peso mínimo de cualquier ruta de A a B. Claramente δ ∗ ab ≤ Δab. Nuestra prueba muestra que el peso Δ ∗ de cada ciclo es exactamente 0, del cual sigue el teorema 4. Parece que no hay una forma directa de calcular δ ∗ y, por lo tanto, procedemos indirectamente. Basado en consideraciones geométricas, identificamos un subconjunto de rutas en GF llamadas rutas admisibles y un subconjunto de rutas admisibles llamadas rutas rectas. Probamos que para dos resultados A, B, hay un camino recto de A a B (Lemma 8 y Corolario 10), y todas las rutas rectas de A a B tienen el mismo peso, que denotamos ρAB (Teorema 12). Mostramos que ρab ≤ Δab (Lemma 14) y que el ρ-pescado de cada ciclo es 0. El paso clave para esta prueba es mostrar que el peso ρ de cada triángulo dirigido es 0 (Lemma 17). Resulta que ρ es igual a δ ∗ (corolario 20), aunque esta igualdad no es necesaria en la prueba del teorema 4. Para ampliar el resumen anterior, damos las definiciones de un camino admisible y un camino recto. Estos son algo técnicos y dependen de la geometría de f.Primero observamos que, sin pérdida de generalidad, podemos suponer que D está (topológicamente) cerrado (Sección 2). En la sección 3, para cada una a ∈ A, ampliamos el conjunto F - 1 (a) a un conjunto convexo cerrado DA ⊆ D de tal manera que para A, B ∈ A con A = B, Da y Db tienen interiores desaryados. Definimos que una ruta admisible sea una secuencia de resultados (a1, ..., ak) de modo que cada uno de los conjuntos ij = daj ∩ daj+1 no sea vacío (sección 4). Un camino admisible es recto si hay una línea recta que cumple con un punto de cada uno de los conjuntos i1 ,..., IK - 1 en orden (Sección 5). Finalmente, mencionamos cómo se usan las hipótesis del dominio convexo y el rango finito en la prueba. Ambas hipótesis son necesarias para mostrar: (1) la existencia de un camino recto de A a B para todos A, B (Lemma 8).(2) que el ρ-peso de un triángulo dirigido es 0 (Lemma 17). La hipótesis del dominio convexo también es necesaria para la convexidad de los conjuntos DA (Sección 3). La hipótesis de rango finito también es necesaria para reducir el teorema 4 al caso de que D está cerrado (Sección 2) y para demostrar que cada ruta recta de A a B tiene el mismo peso δ (Teorema 12).2. Reducción al dominio cerrado primero reducimos el teorema al caso de que D está cerrado. Escriba DC para el cierre de D. ya que a es finito, dc = ∪a∈A (f - 1 (a)) c. Así, para cada v ∈ Dc - d, hay un a = a (v) ∈ A tal que v ∈ (f - 1 (a)) c. Extienda F a la función G en DC definiendo g (v) = a (v) para v ∈ Dc - d y g (v) = f (v) para v ∈ D. Es fácil verificar que ΔAB (g)= Δab (f) para todos A, b ∈ A y, por lo tanto, es suficiente mostrar que la propiedad no negativa de dos ciclos para G implica la propiedad del ciclo no negativo para g.En adelante, asumimos que D es convexo y cerrado.3. Una disección del dominio en esta sección, construimos una familia de conjuntos convexos cerrados {da: a ∈ A} con interiores disjuntos cuya unión es d y satisface F - 1 (a) ⊆ Da para cada una a ∈ A. Sea RA = {V: ∀b ∈ A, V (A) - V (B) ≥ Δab}. La AR es un poliedro cerrado que contiene F - 1 (a). La siguiente proposición implica que dos de estos poliedros se cruzan solo en su límite. Proposición 5. Sea A, B ∈ A. Si v ∈ Ra ∩rb entonces v (a) - v (b) = Δab = −ΔBA.288 DA DB DC DD DE V W X Y Z U P Figura 1: Un dominio bidimensional con 5 resultados. Prueba.v ∈ Ra implica v (a)-v (b) ≥ Δab y v ∈ Rb implica v (b) −v (a) ≥ ΔBA que, por la propiedad no negativa de dos ciclos, implica V (a)-V (B) ≤ Δab. Así, v (a) - v (b) = Δab y por simetría v (b) - v (a) = ΔBA. Finalmente, restringimos la colección de conjuntos {RA: A ∈ A} al dominio d definiendo Da = Ra ∩ D para cada uno a ∈ A. Claramente, DA está cerrado y convexo, y contiene F - 1 (a). Por lo tanto, S a∈A da = D. también, por la Proposición 5, cualquier punto V en Da ∩ db satisface v (a) - v (b) = Δab = −ΔBA.4. Rutas y secuencias D Una ruta del tamaño k es una secuencia-→ a = (a1, ..., ak) con cada ai ∈ A (posiblemente con repetición). Llamamos - → a una ruta (a1, ak). Para una ruta - → A, escribimos | - → A |Para el tamaño de - → a.- → An es simple si el AIS es distinto. Para b, c ∈ A escribimos PBC para el conjunto de (b, c) -path y SPBC para el conjunto de simples (b, c) -paths. El peso δ de la ruta-→ A está definido por δ (-→ A) = K-1x I = 1 ΔAIAI+1. Una secuencia d de orden k es una secuencia-→ u = (u0, ..., Reino Unido) con cada ui ∈ D (posiblemente con repetición). Llamamos-→ U A (U0, Reino Unido) -Sequence. Para una secuencia D-→ U, escribimos ord (u) para el orden de-→ u. Para V, w ∈ D escribimos SVW para el conjunto de (V, W) -SeShences. Un par compatible es un par (-→ A,-→ U) donde-→ A es una ruta y-→ U es una ords que satisface (-→ U) = |-→ A |y para cada i ∈ [k], tanto UI - 1 como UI pertenecen a DAI. Escribimos C (-→ A) para el conjunto de secuencias D-→ U que son compatibles con-→ A. Decimos que - → A es admisible si C ( - → A) no está vacío. Para - → U ∈ C ( - → A) Definimos ∆- → A ( - → U) = | - → A | −1 x I = 1 (UI (AI) - UI (AI+1)). Para V, W ∈ D y B, C ∈ A, definimos CVW BC como el conjunto de pares compatibles ( - → A, - → U) tal que - → A ∈ Pbc y - → U ∈ SVW. Para ilustrar estas definiciones, la Figura 1 da la disección de un dominio, un plano bidimensional, en cinco regiones DA, DB, DC, DD, DE. D-SECHENCIA (V, W, X, Y, Z) es compatible con la ruta (a, b, c, e) y la ruta (a, b, d, e);D-Securencia (V, W, U, Y, Z) es compatible con una ruta única (A, B, D, E). D-Securanza (X, W, P, Y, Z) es compatible con un camino único (B, A, D, E). Por lo tanto (a, b, c, e), (a, b, d, e) y (b, a, d, e) son caminos admisibles. Sin embargo, la ruta (A, C, D) o la ruta (B, E) no es admisible. Proposición 6. Para cualquier par compatible ( - → A, - → U), ∆− → A ( - → U) = δ ( - → A). Prueba. Sea k = ord ( - → u) = | - → a |. Por la definición de un par compatible, ui ∈ Dai ∩ dai+1 para i ∈ [k - 1].ui (ai) - ui (ai+1) = Δaiai+1 de la proposición 5. Por lo tanto, ∆- → A ( - → U) = K - 1x I = 1 (UI (AI) - UI (AI+1)) = K - 1x I = 1 ΔAIAI+1 = δ ( - → A). Lema 7. Sea B, C ∈ A y Deje - → A, - → A ∈ PBC. Si C ( - → A) ∩ C ( - → A) = ∅ entonces δ ( - → A) = δ ( - → A). Prueba. Deje-→ U sea una secuencia D en C (-→ A) ∩ C (-→ A). Por la Proposición 6, δ ( - → A) = ∆ - → A ( - → U) y δ ( - → A) = ∆− → A ( - → U), es suficiente mostrar ∆- → A ( - → U)) = ∆− → A ( - → U). Sea k = ord ( - → u) = | - → a |= | - → A |. Dado que ∆- → A ( - → U) = K - 1x i = 1 (ui (ai) - ui (ai + 1)) = u1 (a1) + k - 1x i = 2 (ui (ai) - ui−1 (ai)) - uk - 1 (ak) = u1 (b) + k - 1x i = 2 (ui (ai) - ui - 1 (ai)) - uk - 1 (c), ∆− → a (- → u) - ∆− → a ( - → u) = k - 1x i = 2 ((ui (ai) - ui - 1 (ai)) - (ui (ai) - ui - 1 (ai)))))= k - 1x i = 2 ((ui (ai) - ui (ai)) - (ui - 1 (ai) - ui - 1 (ai))). Notando que tanto UI - 1 como UI pertenecen a Dai ∩ Dai, tenemos por la Proposición 5 UI - 1 (AI) - UI - 1 (AI) = ΔAIAI = UI (AI) - UI (AI). Por lo tanto, ∆- → A ( - → U) - ∆− → A ( - → U) = 0. 5. Secuencias D lineales y rutas rectas para V, w ∈ D escribimos VW para el segmento de línea (cerrado) que une V y W.Una secuencia d-D-→ U de orden k es lineal siempre que haya una secuencia de números reales 0 = λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤...≤ λk = 1 tal que ui = (1 - λi) u0 + λiuk. En particular, cada interfaz de usuario pertenece a U0UK. Para V, w ∈ D escribimos LVW para el conjunto de secuencias lineales (V, W). Para B, C ∈ A y V, W ∈ D escribimos LCVW BC para el conjunto de pares compatibles ( - → A, - → U) tal que - → A ∈ Pbc y - → U ∈ LVW. Para una ruta - → A, escribimos L ( - → A) para el conjunto de secuencias lineales compatibles con - → A. Decimos que - → A es recto si L ( - → A) = ∅. Por ejemplo, en la Figura 1, la secuencia D (V, W, X, Y, Z) es lineal, mientras que (V, W, U, Y, Z), (X, W, P, Y, Z) y ((x, v, w, y, z) no lo son. Por lo tanto, la ruta (A, B, C, E) y (A, B, D, E) son rectas. Sin embargo, la ruta (B, A, D, E) no es recta.289 Lema 8. Sea B, C ∈ A y V ∈ Db, W ∈ DC. Hay una ruta simple-→ A y secuencia D-→ U de tal manera que (-→ A,-→ U) ∈ LCVW BC. Además, para cualquier ruta de este tipo - → A, δ ( - → A) ≤ V (B) - V (C). Prueba. Por la convexidad de D, cualquier secuencia de puntos en VW es una secuencia D. Si B = C, la ruta Singleton-→ A = (b) y la secuencia D-→ U = (V, W) son obviamente compatibles.δ ( - → A) = 0 = V (B) - V (C). Así que suponga b = c.Si db ∩DC ∩VW = ∅, elegimos una x arbitraria de este conjunto y dejamos - → a = (b, c) ∈ Spbc, - → u = (v, x, w) ∈ LVW. Nuevamente, es fácil verificar la compatibilidad de ( - → A, - → U). Desde V ∈ Db, V (B) - V (C) ≥ ΔBC = δ ( - → A). Para el caso restante B = C y DB ∩DC ∩VW = ∅, aviso v = W de lo contrario V = W ∈ Db ∩ DC ∩ VW. Por lo tanto, podemos definir λx para cada punto x en VW para ser el número único en [0, 1] tal que x = (1 - λx) v + λxw. Por conveniencia, escribimos x ≤ y para λx ≤ λy. Sea ia = da ∩ vw para cada uno a ∈ A. Dado que d = ∪a∈ADA, tenemos VW = ∪A∈Aia. Además, por la convexidad de DA y VW, IA es un intervalo cerrado (posiblemente trivial). Comenzamos considerando el caso de que Ib e IC son cada uno un solo punto, es decir, ib = {v} e IC = {w}. Sea s un subconjunto mínimo de un ∪s∈Sis satisfactorio = VW. Para cada s ∈ S, es lo máximo, es decir, no contenido en ningún otro, para t ∈ S. En particular, los intervalos {es: s ∈ S} tienen todos los puntos finales izquierdos distintos y todos los puntos finales correctos distintos y el orden deLos puntos finales a la izquierda son los mismos que los de los puntos finales derechos. Sea k = | s |+ 2 e índice S como A2 ,..., AK - 1 en el orden definido por los puntos finales correctos. Denota el intervalo IAI por [li, ri]. Así L2 <L3 <...<lk - 1, r2 <r3 <...<RK - 1 y el hecho de que estos intervalos cubren VW implica L2 = V, RK - 1 = W y para todos 2 ≤ I ≤ K - 2, Li+1 ≤ Ri que implica más a Li <Ri. Ahora definimos la ruta - → a = (a1, a2, ..., ak - 1, ak) con a1 = b, ak = c y a2, a3 ,..., AK - 1 como arriba. Defina la secuencia D lineal-→ U = (U0, U1, ..., Reino Unido) por U0 = U1 = V, Reino Unido = W y para 2 ≤ I ≤ K-1, UI = RI. Sigue inmediatamente que ( - → A, - → U) ∈ Lcvw BC. Ni B ni C están en S desde lb = rb y lc = rc. Así - → A es simple. Finalmente, para mostrar δ ( - → A) ≤ V (B) - V (c), observamos V (B) - V (C) = V (A1) - V (Ak) = K - 1x I = 1 (V (V ((ai) - v (ai+1)) y Δ ( - → a) = ∆− → a ( - → u) = k - 1x i = 1 (ui (ai) - ui (ai+1)) = v(a1) - V (a2) + k - 1x i = 2 (ri (ai) - ri (ai + 1)). Para dos resultados d, e ∈ A, definamos FDE (z) = z (d) −z (e) para todos z ∈ D. Es suficiente mostrar faiai+1 (ri) ≤ faiai+1 (v)2 ≤ I ≤ k - 1. Hecho 9. Para d, e ∈ A, FDE (Z) es una función lineal de z. Además, si x ∈ Dd e y ∈ De con x = y, entonces fde (x) = x (d) - x (e) ≥ ΔDE ≥ −Δed ≥ - (y (e) - y (d)) = fde(y). Por lo tanto, FDE (z) no aumenta monotónicamente a lo largo de la línea ← → xy a medida que z se mueve en la dirección de x a y. Aplicando este hecho con d = ai, e = ai+1, x = li e y = ri da la conclusión deseada. Esto completa la prueba del caso de que ib = {v} e ic = {w}. Para el general Ib, IC, Rb <lc de lo contrario db ∩ dc ∩ vw = ib ∩ ic = ∅. Sea v = rb y w = lc. Claramente, podemos aplicar la conclusión anterior a v ∈ Db, w ∈ DC y obtener un par compatible ( - → a, - → u) ∈ Lcv w bc con - → a simple y δ ( - → a) ≤ v (b)- V (C). Defina la secuencia D-D-D-D-Lineal-→ U por U0 = V, Reino Unido = W y UI = UI para i ∈ [K-1].( - → A, - → U) ∈ LCVW BC es evidente. Además, aplicando el hecho anterior con d = b, e = c, x = v e y = w, obtenemos v (b) - v (c) ≥ v (b) - v (c) ≥ δ ( - → a). Corolario 10. Para cualquier B, C ∈ A hay una ruta recta (B, C). El resultado principal de esta sección (Teorema 12) dice que para cualquier B, C ∈ A, cada recta (B, C) -path tiene el mismo peso δ. Para probar esto, primero fijamos v ∈ Db y w ∈ Dc y mostramos (Lemma 11) que cada recta (B, C) -path compatible con alguna secuencia lineal (V, W) tiene el mismo Δ-Weight ρbc (V (V, V), w). Luego mostramos en el Teorema 12 que ρbc (V, W) es lo mismo para todas las opciones de V ∈ Db y W ∈ DC. Lema 11. Para b, c ∈ A, hay una función ρbc: db × dc - → r satisface que para cualquier ( - → a, - → u) ∈ Lcvw bc, δ ( - → a) = ρbc (v, w). Prueba. Sea ( - → A, - → U), ( - → A, - → U) ∈ LCVW BC. Es suficiente mostrar δ ( - → A) = δ ( - → A). Para hacer esto, construimos un lineal (v, w) -equence-→ u y rutas-→ a ∗,-→ a ∗∗ ∈ Pbc, ambas compatibles con-→ u, satisfaciendo δ (-→ a ∗) = δ (- → A) y δ ( - → A ∗∗) = δ ( - → A). Lemma 7 implica δ ( - → A ∗) = δ ( - → A ∗∗), que completará la prueba. Sea | - → A |= ord ( - → u) = k y | - → a |= ord ( - → U) = l.Seleccionamos-→ U para ser cualquier lineal (V, W) -Sequence (U0, U1, ..., Ut) tal que-→ U y-→ U son subsecuencias de-→ U, es decir, hay índices 0= i0 <i1 <· · · <ik = t y 0 = j0 <j1 <· · · <jl = t tal que - → u = (ui0, ui1, ..., uik) y - → u = (uuj0, UJ1, ..., Ujl). Ahora construimos A (B, C) -Path-→ A ∗ Compatible con-→ U tal que δ (-→ A ∗) = δ (-→ A).(Una construcción análoga da - → a ∗∗ compatible con - → u tal que δ ( - → A ∗∗) = δ ( - → A).). Esto completará la prueba.- → a ∗ se define de la siguiente manera: para 1 ≤ j ≤ t, a ∗ j = ar donde r es el índice único que satisface IR - 1 <j ≤ ir. Dado que tanto UIR - 1 = Ur - 1 como UIR = ur pertenecen a DAR, UJ ∈ DAR para IR - 1 ≤ J ≤ IR por la convexidad de DAR. La compatibilidad de ( - → A ∗, - → U) sigue inmediatamente. Claramente, a ∗ 1 = a1 = by a ∗ t = ak = c, entonces - → a ∗ ∈ Pbc. Además, como ΔA ∗ J a ∗ j+1 = Δarar = 0 para cada r ∈ [k], ir - 1 <j <ir, Δ ( - → a ∗) = k - 1x r = 1 ΔA ∗ ir ∗ ir ∗+1 = k - 1x r = 1 Δarar+1 = δ ( - → A). Ahora estamos listos para el teorema principal de la sección: Teorema 12. ρbc es un mapa constante en DB × DC. Por lo tanto, para cualquier b, c ∈ A, cada recta (b, c) -path tiene el mismo Δweight. Prueba. Para una ruta-→ A, (V, W) es compatible con-→ A si hay una secuencia lineal (V, W) compatible con-→ A. Escribimos CP ( - → A) para el conjunto de pares (V, W) compatibles con - → A.ρbc es constante en CP ( - → A) porque para cada (V, W) ∈ Cp ( - → A), ρbc (V, W) = δ ( - → A). Por Lemma 8, también tiene - → A ∈PBC CP ( - → A) = DB × DC. Como A es finito, SPBC, el conjunto de rutas simples de B a C, también es finito.290 A continuación, demostramos que para cualquier ruta - → A, CP ( - → A) está cerrado. Sea ((VN, Wn): n ∈ N) una secuencia convergente en CP ( - → A) y Sea (V, W) el límite. Queremos mostrar que (V, W) ∈ CP ( - → A). Para cada n ∈ N, ya que (vn, wn) ∈ Cp (-→ a), hay una secuencia lineal (vn, wn) un compatible con-→ a, es decir, hay 0 = λn 0 ≤ λn 1 ≤...≤ λn k = 1 (k = | - → a |) de modo que un j = (1 - λn j) vn + λn j wn (j = 0, 1, ..., k). Dado que para cada n, λn = (λn 0, λn 1, ..., λn k) pertenece al conjunto limitado cerrado [0, 1] k+1 podemos elegir un subconjunto infinito i ⊆ n tal que la secuencia (λn: n ∈ I) converge. Sea λ = (λ0, λ1, ..., λk) el límite. Claramente 0 = λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤ · · · ≤ λk = 1. Defina la secuencia lineal (v, w)-→ U por UJ = (1-λj) V + λj W (J = 0, 1, ..., K). Luego para cada j ∈ {0 ,..., k}, UJ es el límite de la secuencia (un j: n ∈ I). Para j> 0, cada un j pertenece al conjunto cerrado Daj, por lo que uj ∈ Daj. Del mismo modo, para j <k, cada un j pertenece al conjunto cerrado Daj+1, por lo que uj ∈ Daj+1. Por lo tanto ( - → A, - → U) es compatible, lo que implica (V, W) ∈ Cp ( - → A). Ahora tenemos DB × DC cubierto por finitamente muchos subconjuntos cerrados en cada uno de ellos ρbc es una constante. Supongamos por contradicción que hay (v, w), (v, w) ∈ Db × dc tal que ρbc (v, w) = ρbc (v, w). L = {((1 - λ) V + λv, (1 - λ) W + λw): λ ∈ [0, 1]} es un segmento de línea en DB × DC por la convexidad de DB, DC. Sea l1 = {(x, y) ∈ L: ρbc (x, y) = ρbc (v, w)} y l2 = l - l1. Claramente (v, w) ∈ L1, (v, w) ∈ L2. Sea p = { - → a ∈ Spbc: δ ( - → a) = ρbc (v, w)}. L1 = `s - → a ∈P cp ( - → a) ´ ∩ l, l2 = s - → a ∈Pbc - p cp ( - → a) ∩ l están cerrados por la finura de P. esta es una contradicción,Dado que es bien sabido (y fácil de probar) que un segmento de línea no puede expresarse como la unión disjunta de dos conjuntos cerrados no vacíos. Resumiendo el Corolario 10, Lemma 11 y el Teorema 12, tenemos el Corolario 13. Para cualquier b, c ∈ A, hay un número real ρbc con la propiedad que (1) hay al menos una recta (b, c) -path de Δ-peso ρbc y (2) cada recto (b, c)-Path tiene δ-peso ρbc.6. Prueba del teorema 4 Lemma 14. ρbc ≤ Δbc para todos b, c ∈ A. Prueba. Para la contradicción, suponga que ρbc - ΔBC => 0. Por la definición de ΔBC, existe v ∈ F - 1 (b) ⊆ db con v (b) - v (c) <ΔBC + = ρbc. Elija un arbitrary w ∈ Dc. Por Lemma 8, hay un par compatible ( - → A, - → U) ∈ LCVW BC con δ ( - → A) ≤ V (B) - V (C). Dado que-→ A es un recto (b, c) -path, ρbc = δ (-→ a) ≤ v (b)-v (c), lo que lleva a una contradicción. Definir otro gráfico completo de borde dirigido GF en el vértice Set A donde es el peso del arco (A, B) ρAB. Inmediatamente de Lemma 14, el peso de cada ciclo dirigido en GF está limitado por debajo de su peso en GF. Para probar el Teorema 4, es suficiente mostrar la propiedad del ciclo cero de GF, es decir, cada ciclo dirigido tiene peso cero. Comenzamos considerando dos ciclos. Lema 15. ρbc + ρcb = 0 para todos b, c ∈ A. Prueba. Sea-→ A una trayectoria recta (b, c) compatible con secuencia lineal-→ u.Sea - → A el reverso de - → A y - → U el reverso de - → U. Obviamente, (-→ A,-→ U) también es compatible y, por lo tanto,-→ A es una recta (c, b) -path. Por lo tanto, ρbc + ρcb = δ ( - → a) + δ ( - → a) = k - 1x i = 1 ΔAiai + 1 + k - 1x i = 1 Δai + 1ai = k - 1x i = 1 (Δaiai + 1+ Δai+ 1ai) = 0, donde la igualdad final usa la Proposición 5. A continuación, durante tres ciclos, primero consideramos aquellos compatibles con triples lineales. Lema 16. Si hay puntos colineales u ∈ Da, v ∈ Db, w ∈ Dc (a, b, c ∈ A), ρab + ρbc + ρca = 0. Prueba. Primero, probamos para el caso donde V está entre U y W.De Lemma 8, hay pares compatibles ( - → A, - → U) ∈ Lcuv AB, ( - → A, - → U) ∈ Lcvw BC. Sea | - → A |= ord ( - → u) = k y | - → a |= ord ( - → U) = l.Peguamos - → A y - → A juntos como - → a = (a = a1, a2, ..., ak - 1, ak, a1, ..., al = c), - → u y - → ucomo - → u = (u = u0, u1, ..., uk = v = u0, u1, ..., ul = w). Claramente ( - → a, - → u) ∈ Lcuw ac y Δ ( - → a) = k - 1x i = 1 Δaiai + 1 + Δak a1 + l - 1x i = 1 Δai ai + 1 = Δ ( - → a) + ΔBB + δ ( - → A) = δ ( - → A) + δ ( - → A). Por lo tanto, ρac = δ ( - → A) = δ ( - → A) + δ ( - → A) = ρab + ρbc. Además, ρac = −ρca por Lemma 15, por lo que obtenemos ρab + ρbc + ρca = 0. Ahora supongamos que W está entre U y V El caso de que U es entre V y W es similar. Ahora estamos listos para la propiedad cero de tres ciclos: Lemma 17. ρab + ρbc + ρca = 0 para todos A, B, C ∈ A. Prueba. Sea s = {(a, b, c): ρab + ρbc + ρca = 0} y para contradicción, suponga que s = ∅. S es finito. Para cada una a ∈ A, elija Va ∈ Da arbitrariamente y deje que T sea el casco convexo de {Va: a ∈ A}. Para cada uno (A, B, C) ∈ S, deje que Rabc = DA × DB × DC ∩ T3. Claramente, cada rabc no es vacío y compacto. Además, por Lemma 16, no (U, V, W) ∈ Rabc es colineal. Definir f: d3 → r por f (u, v, w) = | v --u |+| w - v |+| u - w |. Para (a, b, c) ∈ S, la restricción de F al conjunto compacto rabc alcanza un mínimo m (a, b, c) en algún momento (u, v, w) ∈ Rabc por la continuidad de F, es decir, es decir, existe un triángulo ∆UVW de perímetro mínimo dentro de t con u ∈ Da, v ∈ Db, w ∈ Dc. Elija (a ∗, b ∗, c ∗) ∈ S para que m (a ∗, b ∗, c ∗) sea mínimo y deje (u ∗, v ∗, w ∗) ∈ Ra ∗ b ∗ c ∗ sea un tripleLograrlo. Elija un punto arbitrario P en el interior de ∆U ∗ V ∗ W ∗. Por la convexidad del dominio d, hay d ∈ A tal que p ∈ Dd.291 Considere triángulos ∆U ∗ PW ∗, ∆W ∗ PV ∗ y ∆V ∗ PU ∗. Dado que cada uno de ellos tiene perímetro menor que el de ∆u ∗ v ∗ w ∗ y los tres triángulos están contenidos en t, por la minimalidad de ∆u ∗ v ∗ w ∗, (a ∗, d, c ∗), (c∗, d, b ∗), (b ∗, d, a ∗) ∈ S. Por lo tanto ρa ∗ d + ρdc ∗ + ρc ∗ a ∗ = 0, ρc ∗ d + ρdb ∗ + ρb ∗ c ∗ = 0, ρb∗ d + ρda ∗ + ρa ∗ b ∗ = 0. Resumiendo las tres igualidades, (ρa ∗ d + ρdc ∗ + ρc ∗ d + ρdb ∗ + ρb ∗ d + ρda ∗) + (ρc ∗ a ∗ + ρb ∗ c ∗ + ρa ∗ b ∗) = 0, que los arrojanA Contradicción ρA ∗ B ∗ + ρb ∗ C ∗ + ρc ∗ a ∗ = 0. Con las propiedades cero de dos ciclos y tres ciclos, la propiedad del ciclo cero de GF es inmediata. Como se señaló anteriormente, esto completa la prueba del Teorema 4. Teorema 18. Cada ciclo dirigido de GF tiene peso cero. Prueba. Claramente, las propiedades cero de dos ciclos y tres ciclos implican la igualdad triangular ρab +ρbc = ρac para todos los A, B, C ∈ A. Para un ciclo dirigido c = a1a2...Aka1, aplicando inductivamente la igualdad triangular, tenemos pk - 1 i = 1 ρaiai+1 = ρa1ak. Por lo tanto, el peso de C es k - 1x i = 1 ρaiai + 1 + ρaka1 = ρa1ak + ρaka1 = 0. Como comentarios finales, observamos que nuestro resultado implica los siguientes fortalecimiento del Teorema 12: Corolario 19. Para cualquier B, C ∈ A, cada ruta admisible (B, C) tiene el mismo Δ-peso ρbc. Prueba. Primero tenga en cuenta que para cualquier b, c ∈ A, si db ∩dc = ∅, Δbc = ρbc. Para ver esto, elija V ∈ Db ∩ DC arbitrariamente. Obviamente, la ruta-→ A = (B, C) es compatible con la secuencia lineal-→ U = (V, V, V) y, por lo tanto, es una recta (B, C) -path. Por lo tanto, ρbc = δ ( - → A) = ΔBC. Ahora para cualquier B, C ∈ A y cualquier (B, C) -Path-→ A con C (-→ A) = ∅, Let-→ U ∈ C (-→ A). Desde ui ∈ Dai ∩ dai+1 para i ∈ [| - → a |- 1], δ ( - → a) = | - → a | −1 x i = 1 ΔAiai+1 = | - → a | −1 x i = 1 ρaiai+1, que por el teorema 18, = −ρA |- → a | a1 = ρa1a | - → a |= ρbc. Corolario 20. Para cualquier b, c ∈ A, ρbc es igual a δ ∗ BC, el peso mínimo δ sobre todas las patillas (b, c). Prueba. Claramente ρbc ≥ δ ∗ BC por Corolario 13. Por otro lado, por cada (b, c) -path-→ a = (b = a1, a2, ..., ak = c), por lemma 14, δ (-→ a) = k-1x i =1 ΔAiai+1 ≥ k - 1x i = 1 ρaiai+1, que por el teorema 18, = −ρaka1 = ρa1ak = ρbc. Por lo tanto, ρbc ≤ Δ ∗ BC, que completa la prueba.7. Controladores de formas más fuertes del Teorema 4 Teorema 4 se aplica a las funciones de elección social con el dominio convexo y el rango finito. Ahora mostramos que ninguna de estas hipótesis se puede omitir. Nuestros ejemplos son las funciones de un solo jugador. El primer ejemplo ilustra que la convexidad no se puede omitir. Presentamos una función de elección social para un solo jugador con tres resultados A, B, C que satisfacen W-Mon en un dominio conectado a la ruta pero no convexo. El dominio es el límite de un triángulo cuyos vértices son x = (0, 1, −1), y = (−1, 0, 1) y z = (1, −1, 0).X y al segmento de línea abierta a ZX se le asigna el resultado A, Y y al segmento de línea abierta XY se asigna el resultado B, y Z y el segmento de línea abierta YZ se asigna el resultado c.Claramente, Δab = −ΔBA = ΔBC = −ΔCB = ΔCA = −ΔAC = −1, W-MON (la propiedad no negativa de Twocycle) es válida. Dado que hay un ciclo negativo ΔAb + ΔBC + ΔCA = −3, por Lemma 3, esta no es una función de elección sincera. Ahora mostramos que la hipótesis del rango finito no se puede omitir. Construimos una familia de funciones de elección social para un jugador, cada una con un dominio convexo y un número infinito de resultados, y satisfacer la monotonicidad débil pero no la veracidad. Nuestros ejemplos serán especificados mediante un entero positivo N y una matriz N × N M que satisface las siguientes propiedades: (1) M no es singular.(2) m es semidefinita positiva.(3) Hay distintos i1, i2 ,..., ik ∈ [n] satisfacer k - 1x j = 1 (m (ij, ij) - m (ij, ij + 1)) + (m (ik, ik) - m (ik, i1)) <0. Aquí hay una matriz de ejemplo con n = 3 y (i1, i2, i3) = (1, 2, 3): 0 @ 0 1 −1 −1 0 1 1 −1 0 1 A Let E1, E2 ,..., en denota la base estándar de RN. Deje que Sn denote el casco convexo de {e1, e2..., en}, que es el conjunto de vectores en RN con coordenadas no negativas que suma a 1. El rango de nuestra función de elección social será el SN establecido y el dominio D será indexado por Sn, es decir, d = {yλ: λ ∈ Sn}, donde yλ se define a continuación. La función f mapea yλ a λ. A continuación, especificamos Yλ. Por definición, D debe ser un conjunto de funciones de Sn a R. para λ ∈ Sn, el elemento de dominio Yλ: Sn - → R se define por Yλ (α) = λt Mα. La incomodidad de M garantiza que yλ = yµ para λ = µ ∈ Sn. Es fácil ver que D es un subconjunto convexo del conjunto de todas las funciones de SN a R. El gráfico de resultados GF es un gráfico infinito cuyo conjunto de vértices es el conjunto de resultados A = SN. Para los resultados λ, µ ∈ A, el peso del borde Δλµ es igual a Δλµ = inf {v (λ) - V (µ): f (v) = λ} = yλ (λ) - yλ (µ) = λt mλ -λt mµ = λt m (λ - µ). Afirmamos que GF satisface la propiedad no negativa de dos ciclos (W-Mon) pero tiene un ciclo negativo (y por lo tanto no es sincero). Para los resultados λ, µ ∈ A, Δλµ +Δµλ = λt m (λ - µ) +µt m (µ - λ) = (λ - µ) t m (λ - µ), 292 que no es negativo ya que M es una semidefinita positiva. Por lo tanto, la propiedad no negativa de dos ciclos se mantiene. A continuación, mostramos que GF tiene un ciclo negativo. Deje i1, i2 ,..., es una secuencia de índices que satisfacen la propiedad 3 de M. Reclamamos EI1 EI2...EIK EI1 es un ciclo negativo. Dado que ΔEiej = et i m (ei - eJ) = m (i, i) - m (i, j) para cualquier i, j ∈ [k], el peso del ciclo k - 1x j = 1 ΔEij eij+1+ ΔEIK ei1 = k - 1x j = 1 (m (ij, ij) - m (ij, ij + 1)) + (m (ik, ik) - m (ik, i1)) <0, que completa la prueba. Finalmente, señalamos que la tercera propiedad impuesta a la matriz M tiene la siguiente interpretación. Sea r (m) = {r1, r2 ,..., rn} ser el conjunto de vectores de fila de M y deje que HM sea la función de elección social para un solo jugador con el dominio R (M) y el rango {1, 2 ,..., n} mapeo ri a i. La propiedad 3 es equivalente a la condición de que el GHM Graph de resultados tenga un ciclo negativo. Por Lemma 3, esto es equivalente a la condición de que HM sea falso.8. El trabajo futuro como se indica en la introducción, el objetivo subyacente al trabajo en este documento es obtener caracterizaciones útiles y generales de la veracidad. Digamos que un conjunto D de P × A Real Valuation Matrices es un dominio WM si alguna función de elección social en D satisfacer la monotonicidad débil es sincero. En este artículo, demostramos que para A finito A, cualquier convex D es un dominio WM. Típicamente, los dominios de las funciones de elección social consideradas en el diseño del mecanismo son convexos, pero hay ejemplos interesantes con dominios no convexos, por ejemplo, subastas combinatorias con licitadores resueltos desconocidos. Es intrigante encontrar las condiciones más generales bajo las cuales un conjunto D de matrices reales es un dominio WM. Creemos que la convexidad es la parte principal de la historia, es decir, un dominio WM es, después de excluir algunos casos excepcionales, esencialmente un conjunto convexo. En cuanto a las representaciones paramétricas, digamos que un conjunto D de Matrices P × A es un dominio AM si alguna función de elección social sincera con el dominio D es un maximizador afín. El teorema de Roberts dice que el dominio sin restricciones es un dominio AM. ¿Cuáles son las condiciones más generales bajo las cuales un conjunto D de matrices reales es un dominio AM?

        "By carefully choosing the payment function, one can hope to entice each player to tell the truth.",
        "A social choice function augmented with a payment function is called a mechanism 1 and the mechanism is said to implement the social choice function.",

        "A social choice function is truthfully implementable, or truthful if it has a truthful implementation. (The property of truthful implementability is sometimes called dominant strategy incentive compatibility).",
        "This framework leads naturally to the question: which social choice functions are truthful?",

        "It turns out that the domain of the function, i.e., the set of allowed valuation matrices, is crucial.",
        "For functions with unrestricted domain, i.e., whose domain is the set of all real matrices, there are very good characterizations of truthfulness.",
        "For general domains, however, the picture is far from complete.",
        "Typically, the domains of social choice functions are specified by a system of constraints.",
        "For example, an order constraint requires that one specified entry in some row be larger than another in the same row, a range constraint places an upper or lower bound on an entry, and a zero constraint forces an entry to be 0.",
        "These are all examples of linear inequality constraints on the matrix entries.",
        "Building on work of Roberts [10], Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] defined a condition called weak monotonicity (WMON). (Independently, in the context of multi-unit auctions, Bikhchandani, Chatterji and Sen [3] identified the same condition and called it nondecreasing in marginal utilities (NDMU).)",
        "The definition of W-MON can be formulated in terms of obstructions: for some specified simple set F of functions each having domains of size 2, a function satisfies W-MON if it contains no function from F. The functions in F are not truthful, and therefore W-MON is a necessary condition for truthfulness.",
        "Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] showed that W-MON is also sufficient for truthfulness for social choice functions whose domain is order-based, i.e., defined by order constraints and zero constraints, and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] extended this to other domains.",

        "The two hypotheses on the social choice function, that the domain is convex and that the range is finite, can not be omitted as is shown by the examples given in section 7. 1.1 Related Work There is a simple and natural parametrized set of truthful social choice functions called affine maximizers.",
        "Roberts [10] showed that for functions with unrestricted domain, every truthful function is an affine maximizer, thus providing a parametrized representation for truthful functions with unrestricted domain.",
        "There are many known examples of truthful functions over restricted domains that are not affine maximizers (see [1], [2], [4], [6] and [7]).",
        "Each of these examples has a special structure and it seems plausible that there might be some mild restrictions on the class of all social choice functions such that all truthful functions obeying these restrictions are affine maximizers.",
        "Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] obtained a result in this direction by showing that for order-based domains, under certain technical assumptions, every truthful social choice function is almost an affine maximizer.",

        "The following easily proved fact is used extensively in the literature: Proposition 2.",
        "The social choice function f is truthful if and only if every local subfunction of f is truthful.",
        "This implies that the set of all local non-truthful functions comprises a complete set of obstructions for truthfulness.",
        "This set is much smaller than the set of all non-truthful functions, but is still far from a minimal set of obstructions.",
        "Rochet [11], Rozenshtrom [12] and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] identified a necessary and sufficient condition for truthfulness (see lemma 3 below) called the nonnegative cycle property.",
        "This condition can be viewed as providing a minimal complete set of non-truthful functions.",
        "As is required by proposition 2, each function in the set is local.",
        "Furthermore it is one-to-one.",
        "In particular its domain has size at most the number of possible outcomes |A|.",
        "As this complete set of obstructions consists of minimal non-truthful functions, this provides the optimal obstruction characterization of non-truthful functions within the class of all social choice functions.",
        "But by restricting attention to interesting subclasses of social choice functions, one may hope to get simpler sets of obstructions for truthfulness within that class.",
        "The condition of weak monotonicity mentioned earlier can be defined by a set of obstructions, each of which is a local function of domain size exactly 2.",
        "Thus the results of Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6], and of Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] give a very simple set of obstructions for truthfulness within certain subclasses of social choice functions.",
        "Theorem 1 extends these results to a much larger subclass of functions. 287 1.2 Weak Monotonicity and the Nonnegative Cycle Property By proposition 2, a function is truthful if and only if each of its local subfunctions is truthful.",
        "Therefore, to get a set of obstructions for truthfulness, it suffices to obtain such a set for local functions.",
        "The domain of an i-local function consists of matrices that are fixed on all rows but row i.",

                "An important approach for dealing with this problem is to augment a given social choice function with a payment function, which assigns to each player a (positive or negative) payment as a function of all of the individual preferences.",
                "By carefully choosing the payment function, one can hope to entice each player to tell the truth.",
                "A social choice function augmented with a payment function is called a mechanism 1 and the mechanism is said to implement the social choice function.",
                "A mechanism is truthful (or to be strategyproof or to have a dominant strategy) if each players best strategy, knowing the preferences of the others, is always to declare his own true preferences.",
                "A social choice function is truthfully implementable, or truthful if it has a truthful implementation. (The property of truthful implementability is sometimes called dominant strategy incentive compatibility).",

                "We are not aware of any work on recognition algorithms for the property of truthfulness, but there are significant results concerning parametric representations and obstruction characterizations of truthfulness.",
                "It turns out that the domain of the function, i.e., the set of allowed valuation matrices, is crucial.",
                "For functions with unrestricted domain, i.e., whose domain is the set of all real matrices, there are very good characterizations of truthfulness.",
                "For general domains, however, the picture is far from complete.",
                "Typically, the domains of social choice functions are specified by a system of constraints.",
                "For example, an order constraint requires that one specified entry in some row be larger than another in the same row, a range constraint places an upper or lower bound on an entry, and a zero constraint forces an entry to be 0.",
                "These are all examples of linear inequality constraints on the matrix entries.",
                "Building on work of Roberts [10], Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] defined a condition called <br>weak monotonicity</br> (WMON).

                "The definition of W-MON can be formulated in terms of obstructions: for some specified simple set F of functions each having domains of size 2, a function satisfies W-MON if it contains no function from F. The functions in F are not truthful, and therefore W-MON is a necessary condition for truthfulness.",
                "Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] showed that W-MON is also sufficient for truthfulness for social choice functions whose domain is order-based, i.e., defined by order constraints and zero constraints, and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] extended this to other domains.",

                "Using the interpretation of <br>weak monotonicity</br> in terms of obstructions each having domain size 2, this provides a complete set of minimal obstructions for truthfulness within the class of social choice functions with convex domains.",
                "The two hypotheses on the social choice function, that the domain is convex and that the range is finite, can not be omitted as is shown by the examples given in section 7. 1.1 Related Work There is a simple and natural parametrized set of truthful social choice functions called affine maximizers.",

                "Each of these examples has a special structure and it seems plausible that there might be some mild restrictions on the class of all social choice functions such that all truthful functions obeying these restrictions are affine maximizers.",
                "Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] obtained a result in this direction by showing that for order-based domains, under certain technical assumptions, every truthful social choice function is almost an affine maximizer.",
                "There are a number of results about truthfulness that can be viewed as providing obstruction characterizations, although the notion of obstruction is not explicitly discussed.",

                "The social choice function f is truthful if and only if every local subfunction of f is truthful.",
                "This implies that the set of all local non-truthful functions comprises a complete set of obstructions for truthfulness.",

                "Rochet [11], Rozenshtrom [12] and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] identified a necessary and sufficient condition for truthfulness (see lemma 3 below) called the nonnegative cycle property.",

                "As is required by proposition 2, each function in the set is local.",

                "But by restricting attention to interesting subclasses of social choice functions, one may hope to get simpler sets of obstructions for truthfulness within that class.",

                "INTRODUCTION Social choice theory centers around the general problem of selecting a single outcome out of a set A of alternative outcomes based on the individual preferences of a set P of players.",
                "A method for aggregating player preferences to select one outcome is called a social choice function.",
                "In this paper we assume that the range A is finite and that each players preference is expressed by a valuation function which assigns to each possible outcome a real number representing the benefit the player derives from that outcome.",
                "The ensemble of player valuation functions is viewed as a valuation matrix with rows indexed by players and columns by outcomes.",
                "A major difficulty connected with social choice functions is that players can not be required to tell the truth about their preferences.",
                "Since each player seeks to maximize his own benefit, he may find it in his interest to misrepresent his valuation function.",
                "An important approach for dealing with this problem is to augment a given social choice function with a payment function, which assigns to each player a (positive or negative) payment as a function of all of the individual preferences.",
                "By carefully choosing the payment function, one can hope to entice each player to tell the truth.",
                "A social choice function augmented with a payment function is called a mechanism 1 and the mechanism is said to implement the social choice function.",
                "A mechanism is truthful (or to be strategyproof or to have a dominant strategy) if each players best strategy, knowing the preferences of the others, is always to declare his own true preferences.",
                "A social choice function is truthfully implementable, or truthful if it has a truthful implementation. (The property of truthful implementability is sometimes called dominant strategy incentive compatibility).",
                "This framework leads naturally to the question: which social choice functions are truthful?",
                "This question is of the following general type: given a class of functions (here, social choice functions) and a property that holds for some of them (here, truthfulness), characterize the property.",
                "The definition of the property itself provides a characterization, so what more is needed?",
                "Here are some useful notions of characterization: • <br>recognition algorithm</br>.",
                "Give an algorithm which, given an appropriate representation of a function in the class, determines whether the function has the property. • Parametric representation.",
                "Give an explicit parametrized family of functions and show that each function in the 1 The usual definition of mechanism is more general than this (see [8] Chapter 23.C or [9]); the mechanisms we consider here are usually called direct revelation mechanisms. 286 family has the property, and that every function with the property is in the family.",
                "A third notion applies in the case of hereditary properties of functions.",
                "A function g is a subfunction of function f, or f contains g, if g is obtained by restricting the domain of f. A property P of functions is hereditary if it is preserved under taking subfunctions.",
                "Truthfulness is easily seen to be hereditary. • Sets of obstructions.",
                "For a hereditary property P, a function g that does not have the property is an obstruction to the property in the sense that any function containing g doesnt have the property.",
                "An obstruction is minimal if every proper subfunction has the property.",
                "A set of obstructions is complete if every function that does not have the property contains one of them as a subfunction.",
                "The set of all functions that dont satisfy P is a complete (but trivial and uninteresting) set of obstructions; one seeks a set of small (ideally, minimal) obstructions.",
                "We are not aware of any work on recognition algorithms for the property of truthfulness, but there are significant results concerning parametric representations and obstruction characterizations of truthfulness.",
                "It turns out that the domain of the function, i.e., the set of allowed valuation matrices, is crucial.",
                "For functions with unrestricted domain, i.e., whose domain is the set of all real matrices, there are very good characterizations of truthfulness.",
                "For general domains, however, the picture is far from complete.",
                "Typically, the domains of social choice functions are specified by a system of constraints.",
                "For example, an order constraint requires that one specified entry in some row be larger than another in the same row, a range constraint places an upper or lower bound on an entry, and a zero constraint forces an entry to be 0.",
                "These are all examples of linear inequality constraints on the matrix entries.",
                "Building on work of Roberts [10], Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] defined a condition called weak monotonicity (WMON). (Independently, in the context of multi-unit auctions, Bikhchandani, Chatterji and Sen [3] identified the same condition and called it nondecreasing in marginal utilities (NDMU).)",
                "The definition of W-MON can be formulated in terms of obstructions: for some specified simple set F of functions each having domains of size 2, a function satisfies W-MON if it contains no function from F. The functions in F are not truthful, and therefore W-MON is a necessary condition for truthfulness.",
                "Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] showed that W-MON is also sufficient for truthfulness for social choice functions whose domain is order-based, i.e., defined by order constraints and zero constraints, and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] extended this to other domains.",
                "The domain constraints considered in both papers are special cases of linear inequality constraints, and it is natural to ask whether W-MON is sufficient for any domain defined by such constraints.",
                "Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] conjectured that W-MON suffices for convex domains.",
                "The main result of this paper is an affirmative answer to this conjecture: Theorem 1.",
                "For any social choice function having convex domain and finite range, weak monotonicity is necessary and sufficient for truthfulness.",
                "Using the interpretation of weak monotonicity in terms of obstructions each having domain size 2, this provides a complete set of minimal obstructions for truthfulness within the class of social choice functions with convex domains.",
                "The two hypotheses on the social choice function, that the domain is convex and that the range is finite, can not be omitted as is shown by the examples given in section 7. 1.1 Related Work There is a simple and natural parametrized set of truthful social choice functions called affine maximizers.",
                "Roberts [10] showed that for functions with unrestricted domain, every truthful function is an affine maximizer, thus providing a parametrized representation for truthful functions with unrestricted domain.",
                "There are many known examples of truthful functions over restricted domains that are not affine maximizers (see [1], [2], [4], [6] and [7]).",
                "Each of these examples has a special structure and it seems plausible that there might be some mild restrictions on the class of all social choice functions such that all truthful functions obeying these restrictions are affine maximizers.",
                "Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] obtained a result in this direction by showing that for order-based domains, under certain technical assumptions, every truthful social choice function is almost an affine maximizer.",
                "There are a number of results about truthfulness that can be viewed as providing obstruction characterizations, although the notion of obstruction is not explicitly discussed.",
                "For a player i, a set of valuation matrices is said to be i-local if all of the matrices in the set are identical except for row i.",
                "Call a social choice function i-local if its domain is ilocal and call it local if it is i-local for some i.",
                "The following easily proved fact is used extensively in the literature: Proposition 2.",
                "The social choice function f is truthful if and only if every local subfunction of f is truthful.",
                "This implies that the set of all local non-truthful functions comprises a complete set of obstructions for truthfulness.",
                "This set is much smaller than the set of all non-truthful functions, but is still far from a minimal set of obstructions.",
                "Rochet [11], Rozenshtrom [12] and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] identified a necessary and sufficient condition for truthfulness (see lemma 3 below) called the nonnegative cycle property.",
                "This condition can be viewed as providing a minimal complete set of non-truthful functions.",
                "As is required by proposition 2, each function in the set is local.",
                "Furthermore it is one-to-one.",
                "In particular its domain has size at most the number of possible outcomes |A|.",
                "As this complete set of obstructions consists of minimal non-truthful functions, this provides the optimal obstruction characterization of non-truthful functions within the class of all social choice functions.",
                "But by restricting attention to interesting subclasses of social choice functions, one may hope to get simpler sets of obstructions for truthfulness within that class.",
                "The condition of weak monotonicity mentioned earlier can be defined by a set of obstructions, each of which is a local function of domain size exactly 2.",
                "Thus the results of Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6], and of Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] give a very simple set of obstructions for truthfulness within certain subclasses of social choice functions.",
                "Theorem 1 extends these results to a much larger subclass of functions. 287 1.2 Weak Monotonicity and the Nonnegative Cycle Property By proposition 2, a function is truthful if and only if each of its local subfunctions is truthful.",
                "Therefore, to get a set of obstructions for truthfulness, it suffices to obtain such a set for local functions.",
                "The domain of an i-local function consists of matrices that are fixed on all rows but row i.",
                "Fix such a function f and let D ⊆ RA be the set of allowed choices for row i.",
                "Since f depends only on row i and row i is chosen from D, we can view f as a function from D to A.",
                "Therefore, f is a social choice function having one player; we refer to such a function as a single player function.",
                "Associated to any single player function f with domain D we define an edge-weighted directed graph Hf whose vertex set is the image of f. For convenience, we assume that f is surjective and so this image is A.",

                "It is easy to see that Hf has the nonnegative cycle property/nonnegative two-cycle property if and only if Gf does.",
                "Gf is called the outcome graph of f. The weak monotonicity property mentioned earlier can be defined for arbitrary social choice functions by the condition that every local subfunction satisfies the nonnegative two-cycle property.",

                "In this paper we assume that the range A is finite and that each players preference is expressed by a valuation function which assigns to each possible outcome a real number representing the benefit the player derives from that outcome.",
                "The ensemble of player valuation functions is viewed as a valuation matrix with rows indexed by players and columns by outcomes.",
                "A major difficulty connected with social choice functions is that players can not be required to tell the truth about their preferences.",
                "Since each player seeks to maximize his own benefit, he may find it in his interest to misrepresent his valuation function.",
                "An important approach for dealing with this problem is to augment a given social choice function with a payment function, which assigns to each player a (positive or negative) payment as a function of all of the individual preferences.",
                "By carefully choosing the payment function, one can hope to entice each player to tell the truth.",
                "A social choice function augmented with a payment function is called a mechanism 1 and the mechanism is said to implement the social choice function.",
                "A mechanism is truthful (or to be strategyproof or to have a dominant strategy) if each players best strategy, knowing the preferences of the others, is always to declare his own true preferences.",
                "A social choice function is truthfully implementable, or truthful if it has a truthful implementation. (The property of truthful implementability is sometimes called dominant strategy incentive compatibility).",
                "This framework leads naturally to the question: which social choice functions are truthful?",
                "This question is of the following general type: given a class of functions (here, social choice functions) and a property that holds for some of them (here, truthfulness), characterize the property.",
                "The definition of the property itself provides a characterization, so what more is needed?",

                "Give an explicit parametrized family of functions and show that each function in the 1 The usual definition of mechanism is more general than this (see [8] Chapter 23.C or [9]); the mechanisms we consider here are usually called direct revelation mechanisms. 286 family has the property, and that every function with the property is in the family.",

                "A function g is a subfunction of function f, or f contains g, if g is obtained by restricting the domain of f. A property P of functions is hereditary if it is preserved under taking subfunctions.",

                "For a hereditary property P, a function g that does not have the property is an obstruction to the property in the sense that any function containing g doesnt have the property.",

                "A set of obstructions is complete if every function that does not have the property contains one of them as a subfunction.",
                "The set of all functions that dont satisfy P is a complete (but trivial and uninteresting) set of obstructions; one seeks a set of small (ideally, minimal) obstructions.",
                "We are not aware of any work on recognition algorithms for the property of truthfulness, but there are significant results concerning parametric representations and obstruction characterizations of truthfulness.",
                "It turns out that the domain of the function, i.e., the set of allowed valuation matrices, is crucial.",
                "For functions with unrestricted domain, i.e., whose domain is the set of all real matrices, there are very good characterizations of truthfulness.",
                "For general domains, however, the picture is far from complete.",
                "Typically, the domains of social choice functions are specified by a system of constraints.",
                "For example, an order constraint requires that one specified entry in some row be larger than another in the same row, a range constraint places an upper or lower bound on an entry, and a zero constraint forces an entry to be 0.",
                "These are all examples of linear inequality constraints on the matrix entries.",
                "Building on work of Roberts [10], Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] defined a condition called weak monotonicity (WMON). (Independently, in the context of multi-unit auctions, Bikhchandani, Chatterji and Sen [3] identified the same condition and called it nondecreasing in marginal utilities (NDMU).)",
                "The definition of W-MON can be formulated in terms of obstructions: for some specified simple set F of functions each having domains of size 2, a function satisfies W-MON if it contains no function from F. The functions in F are not truthful, and therefore W-MON is a necessary condition for truthfulness.",
                "Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] showed that W-MON is also sufficient for truthfulness for social choice functions whose domain is order-based, i.e., defined by order constraints and zero constraints, and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] extended this to other domains.",
                "The domain constraints considered in both papers are special cases of linear inequality constraints, and it is natural to ask whether W-MON is sufficient for any domain defined by such constraints.",
                "Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] conjectured that W-MON suffices for convex domains.",

                "Using the interpretation of weak monotonicity in terms of obstructions each having domain size 2, this provides a complete set of minimal obstructions for truthfulness within the class of social choice functions with convex domains.",
                "The two hypotheses on the social choice function, that the domain is convex and that the range is finite, can not be omitted as is shown by the examples given in section 7. 1.1 Related Work There is a simple and natural parametrized set of truthful social choice functions called affine maximizers.",
                "Roberts [10] showed that for functions with unrestricted domain, every truthful function is an affine maximizer, thus providing a parametrized representation for truthful functions with unrestricted domain.",
                "There are many known examples of truthful functions over restricted domains that are not affine maximizers (see [1], [2], [4], [6] and [7]).",
                "Each of these examples has a special structure and it seems plausible that there might be some mild restrictions on the class of all social choice functions such that all truthful functions obeying these restrictions are affine maximizers.",
                "Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6] obtained a result in this direction by showing that for order-based domains, under certain technical assumptions, every truthful social choice function is almost an affine maximizer.",
                "There are a number of results about truthfulness that can be viewed as providing obstruction characterizations, although the notion of obstruction is not explicitly discussed.",
                "For a player i, a set of valuation matrices is said to be i-local if all of the matrices in the set are identical except for row i.",
                "Call a social choice function i-local if its domain is ilocal and call it local if it is i-local for some i.",

                "The social choice function f is truthful if and only if every local subfunction of f is truthful.",
                "This implies that the set of all local <br>non-truthful function</br>s comprises a complete set of obstructions for truthfulness.",
                "This set is much smaller than the set of all <br>non-truthful function</br>s, but is still far from a minimal set of obstructions.",
                "Rochet [11], Rozenshtrom [12] and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] identified a necessary and sufficient condition for truthfulness (see lemma 3 below) called the nonnegative cycle property.",
                "This condition can be viewed as providing a minimal complete set of <br>non-truthful function</br>s.",
                "As is required by proposition 2, each function in the set is local.",
                "Furthermore it is one-to-one.",
                "In particular its domain has size at most the number of possible outcomes |A|.",
                "As this complete set of obstructions consists of minimal <br>non-truthful function</br>s, this provides the optimal obstruction characterization of <br>non-truthful function</br>s within the class of all social choice functions.",
                "But by restricting attention to interesting subclasses of social choice functions, one may hope to get simpler sets of obstructions for truthfulness within that class.",
                "The condition of weak monotonicity mentioned earlier can be defined by a set of obstructions, each of which is a local function of domain size exactly 2.",
                "Thus the results of Lavi, Mualem and Nisan [6], and of Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] give a very simple set of obstructions for truthfulness within certain subclasses of social choice functions.",
                "Theorem 1 extends these results to a much larger subclass of functions. 287 1.2 Weak Monotonicity and the Nonnegative Cycle Property By proposition 2, a function is truthful if and only if each of its local subfunctions is truthful.",
                "Therefore, to get a set of obstructions for truthfulness, it suffices to obtain such a set for local functions.",

                "Since f depends only on row i and row i is chosen from D, we can view f as a function from D to A.",
                "Therefore, f is a social choice function having one player; we refer to such a function as a single player function.",
