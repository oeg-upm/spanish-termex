The level set method was presented by Osher and Sethian [20] who described the temporal propagation of moving interfaces by numerical methods solving the Hamilton–Jacobi equation.

The fast marching method [21] provides an efficient numerical scheme of complexity nlogn to compute the support values on the grid.
