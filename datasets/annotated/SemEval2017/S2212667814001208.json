However, poor network performance, heterogeneous and dynamic environments are some series of pitfalls for execution of HPC applications in Cloud. This paper proposes a new approach to improve the performance and scalability of HPC applications on Amazons HPC Cloud. The evidence from our approach points a significant improvement in speed up and scale up with the response rate of more than 20 percent parallel efﬁciency on the Cloud in comparison to dedicated HPC cluster.
