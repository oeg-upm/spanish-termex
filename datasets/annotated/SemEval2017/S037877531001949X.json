    "original_text": "The Substrate Induced Coagulation (SIC) coating process provides a self assembled and almost binder free coating with small particles. Most research so far has been used to coat a variety of surfaces with highly conductive carbon blacks [34,35,36]. Layers deposited by this technique have been used in electromagnetic wave shielding, in the metallization process of through-holes in printed wiring boards, and in the manufacture of conducting polymers (such as Teflon) [37,38,39]. An advantage of this dip-coating process is that it can be used for any kind of surface, provided the substrate is stable in water and that the particles used for the coating form a meta-stable dispersion. Recently, a non-aqueous SIC coating process of carbon black was developed by investigating the stabilities of non-aqueous dispersions [36]. These dispersions were used to prepare LiCoO2-composite electrodes for Li-ion batteries with an improved conductivity while keeping the content of active battery material high [35].",

                "The Substrate Induced Coagulation (SIC) coating process provides a self assembled and almost binder free coating with small particles.",
                "Most research so far has been used to coat a variety of surfaces with highly conductive carbon blacks [34,35,36].",
                "Layers deposited by this technique have been used in electromagnetic wave shielding, in the metallization process of through-holes in printed wiring boards, and in the manufacture of conducting polymers (such as <br>Teflon</br>) [37,38,39].",
                "An advantage of this dip-coating process is that it can be used for any kind of surface, provided the substrate is stable in water and that the particles used for the coating form a meta-stable dispersion.",
                "Recently, a non-aqueous SIC coating process of carbon black was developed by investigating the stabilities of non-aqueous dispersions [36].",
                "These dispersions were used to prepare LiCoO2-composite electrodes for Li-ion batteries with an improved conductivity while keeping the content of active battery material high [35]."
