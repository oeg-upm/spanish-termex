Fig. 17 shows the temperature profile during the recycling of the CPA pill and subsequent operation at 200mK. During the hold time, the servo control program maintained the CPA pill temperature to within a millikelvin. It is expected that microkelvin stability can be achieved with fast read-out thermometry (which was not available at the time of testing but which will be used for the mKCC), as this would allow for temperature control on much faster (millisecond) timescales than the current (approximately 1s) thermometry readout used.",
