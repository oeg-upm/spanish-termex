The micromechanics formulation is fed with composition quantities derived from the systems biology approach, which, in turn, is provided with mechanical stimuli gained from the micromechanics model. We then apply the coupled approach to biochemical and mechanical conditions typical for postmenopausal osteoporosis (Section 4) and microgravity exposure (Section 5), and discuss key sensitivity features (Section 6).
