We believe that the implications of this observation have not been clearly emphasised in the literature, as attested by the absence of any debate about it in recent works. It is precisely these dangerous infrared modes that make it hard to define a gauge independent renormalisation for the gauge invariant extensions of local functionals. This observation supports the remark in [2] that the expectation value receives important contributions from both large and small distances.
