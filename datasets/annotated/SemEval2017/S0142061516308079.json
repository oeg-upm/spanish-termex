    "original_text": "The above discussion summarizes the state of the art related to impacts and interpretations of communication latency between RT simulators. However, research is focused primarily on the effect of the data loss during the communication and how to mitigate it [34]. In the thermo-electric co-simulation example in [35], the time constant is larger in the thermal simulation than that of power system simulation. Thus the communication latency will not significantly affect the accuracy of co-simulation. In [36], the co-simulation is performed using resources at the same location without synthetically introduced delays, which means the communication latency between RT simulators is ignored. In [37], the authors have mentioned the communication latency as an important factor in the distributed simulation and that its effect on simulation stability will be studied as future work. An in-depth research about the role of communication latency and mitigation measure for geographically distributed RT simulations is identified as a technical gap and addressed in this paper.",
