As electrical measurements require an oxygen ion conductor, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was used as substrate for LSC films with two different grain sizes. Quantitative material parameters are deduced from both types of experiments and comparison of the data allowed testing the appropriateness of analysis models.",
