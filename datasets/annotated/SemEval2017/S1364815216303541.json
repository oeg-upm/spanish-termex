The objectives of the survey were to document how a representative cross-section of Utahs adult population thinks about water issues. The survey included three core blocks of questions: perceptions of the adequacy of local water supplies, perceptions of the quality of local water resources, and concern about a range of water and non-water issues. A number of additional questions captured information about respondents familiarity with water cost, lawn-watering behaviors, participation in water based recreation, and demographic attributes. Supplementary material to this paper includes a document with a description of the dataset as a whole, a document containing the complete survey instrument, and two data files containing the results and an associated codebook (see Section 4.3).",
