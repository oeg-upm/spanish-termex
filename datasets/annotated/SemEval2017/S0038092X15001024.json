    "original_text": "The wind speed and cloud height Markov chains are produced accounting for seasonal variations. A Markov chain is used for each variable representing each of the four seasons, capturing the variability at different times of the year, totalling four chains each. The okta number Markov chains also consider the effect of season, with the inclusion of impacts from pressure and diurnal variation. Eight okta Markov chains are produced that are split by above and below average pressure for each season, and four additional morning okta Markov chains are produced to capture the diurnal variation for okta transitions between 00:00 and 05:00am for each season. The intent is to capture the variation in transition probability that occurs as a result of weather changes due to the presence of solar energy. 5am is considered the cut-off because it is a typical sunrise in the summer for the applied study locations. 5h represents 5 okta transitions and is considered an appropriate duration for the slight propensity to shift towards an increased okta to be represented, Fig. 8 demonstrates the diurnal transition differences. Fig. 2 visually demonstrates the mean okta Markov chain for the entire year, whilst the effect of season can be seen in Fig. 11.",
