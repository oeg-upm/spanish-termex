As it has been confirmed by numerous case studies, automation of procedures for the purchase through e-procurement technology enables companies to achieve a reduction in costs (average 8-12%) of total purchases. So web-based models are playing a critical role within companies, especially in the generation of value of supply chain. This article focuses on the role of e-procurement within a supply chain showing, through simulations, the advantages and difficulties of implementing a systematic use of the Internet and defining the basic structure of an e-supply chain.",
