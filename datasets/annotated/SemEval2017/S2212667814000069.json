At first, we represent each system equation by a hyperedge, and then we extend the modeling hypergraph with others colored hyperedges (red and blue) which allows us to perform the analysis task. Based on the bottom up analysis hypergraph model, its very easy to check the system reconfigurability in the presence of fault by verifying the existence of paths from the affected hyperedge to specifics blue hyperedges passing through specifics red hyperedges.
