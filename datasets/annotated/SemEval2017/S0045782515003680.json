The inherent shortcomings of present geometry and analysis representations have motivated the proliferation of various shape optimisation techniques.

Generally, it is tedious or impossible to map the optimised surrogate geometry model or analysis mesh back to the original CAD model, which is essential for continuing with the design process and later for manufacturing purposes. Moreover, geometric design features are usually defined with respect to the CAD model and cannot be easily enforced on the surrogate model.
