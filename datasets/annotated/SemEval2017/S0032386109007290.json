The first work in this area involved an elastin-mimetic di-block copolymer containing VPGEG–(IPGAG)4 and VPGFG–(IPGVG)4 as the hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks, respectively [49]. The resulting micelles were studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and DSC was used to measure the enthalpy of self-assembly. A tri-block copolymer was subsequently synthesized and the TEM images of this polymer showed that it formed spherical aggregates [50]. Other multivalent spherical micelles have been obtained from linear elastin-like AB di-block copolymers in the temperature range 37–42°C with the aim of targeting cancer cells [51]. Bidwell et al. have also exploited the ELRs for its ability to serve as macromolecular carriers for thermally targeted delivery of drugs. Attachment of doxorubicin to ELR-based system showed enhanced cytotoxicity in uterine sarcoma cells when aggregation was induced with hyperthermia [52].",
