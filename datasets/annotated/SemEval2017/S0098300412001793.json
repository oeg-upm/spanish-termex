    "original_text": "MINERAL (MINeral ERror AnaLysis) is a new MATLAB® based program that provides mineral formula recalculations combined with the associated propagation of the analytical uncertainties. Methods are based on the work of Giamarita and Day (1990). However, additional features have been added to provide users with greater flexibility in data reporting. Many programs exist to recalculate wt% data into formula unit cations. Some generalized programs can be used to recalculate the formula of multiple minerals e.g. CALCMIN (Brandelik, 2009) and HYPER-FORM (De Bjerg et al., 1992). Other programs are mineral specific e.g. AMPH CLASS (Esawi, 2004) and PROBE AMPH (Tindle and Webb, 1994) for the recalculation of amphibole analyses; ILMAT (Lepage, 2003) for the recalculation of magnetite and ilmenite; and PX-NOM (Sturm, 2002) for the recalculation of pyroxene analyses. MINERAL provides a rapid method for the recalculation of multiple common minerals. However, its strength lies in the fact that is the first tool to incorporate the associated uncertainty propagation calculations. As these are performed concurrently with the standard recalculations, no additional time is needed to perform uncertainty propagation. While an understanding of the underlying calculations is strongly recommended, MINERAL is designed to allow users with little or no experience operating MATLAB® and/or performing mineral formula recalculations and uncertainty propagation to undertake both with ease.",
