This is still short compared to operating times, so is important to consider the equilibrium result of such processes: If the vacancies and SIAs were likely to find their Frenkel partner, recombine, and annihilate, then the metal should essentially return to its original structure; however, if defects instead formed large clusters of a single type this could result in formation of voids, dislocation loops or swelling, possibly weakening the material in the process.
