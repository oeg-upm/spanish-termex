To cope with this problem, Wu et al. (2013) evaluates a variant of PSR (in that work referred to as scale-adaptive [SA]), which includes curvature-dependent polygonization (e.g. increasing/decreasing the size of triangles according to the local curvature) (Wu et al., 2010). In Wu et al. (2013), other methods including MC (without smoothing and decimation) are evaluated with application to vessel modeling. The authors, point at SA as a suitable method for reconstruction of vessels with applications to surgery planning. The methods evaluated by Wu et al.
