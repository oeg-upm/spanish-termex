The properties of the different modes can be very useful, such as in thickness measurement [13], but in this case they are a complication. SH0 has a thickness independent speed, equal to the shear wave speed, and is non-dispersive (the phase and group speed are equal to the shear wave speed for all frequencies). The oscillation direction of SH ultrasound is in the plane of the surface where the wave was generated, and perpendicular to the propagation direction, as shown in Fig. 1, with respect to a reference interface, which is typically a sample surface.
