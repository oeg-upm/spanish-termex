The research deals with comparing hydrogen recovery with the use of three different catalysts. The amount of the produced hydrogen depends considerably on the reaction state and the catalyst composition. To improve the course of the reaction, natural catalysts – calcite, coal char (unburned residues from coal) and modified olivine – are added to the gasification process and heated to the process temperature of 800, 850 and 900oC.",
