At high burn-ups, i.e. extended service life, oxidation and the associated hydrogen pick-up can be a limiting factor in terms of fuel efficiency and safety. The oxidation kinetics for many zirconium alloys are cyclical, demonstrating a series of approximately cubic kinetic curves separated by transitions [1–5].
