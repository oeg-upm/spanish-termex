The algorithm is based on the spreading activation scheme applied to the graphs dynamically built on the basis of the text words and a large wordnet. The algorithm, originally proposed for English and Princeton WordNet, was adapted to Polish and plWordNet. An extension based on the knowledge acquired from the corpus-derived Measure of Semantic Relatedness was proposed. The extended algorithm was evaluated against the manually disambiguated corpus. We observed improvement in the case of the disambiguation performed for shorter text contexts. In addition the algorithm application expressed improvement in document clustering task.",
