More concretely, we generalize the one-loop partition functions, as derived in [11,13] for levels being odd, to the case of even levels. Moreover, on the level of partition functions we implement additional dressings of the world-sheet parity symmetry and identify them with the dressings introduced in [12] in the crosscap state approach. As expected, all the physical information can be read off entirely from the various amplitudes. We will end up with a collection of very explicit and general one-loop partition functions and tadpole cancellation conditions covering simple current extensions of all 168 Gepner models with additional dressings of the parity symmetry. In fact providing a compact collection of the main relevant formulas for constructing supersymmetric Gepner model orientifolds was one of the motivations for writing this Letter. We hope that these expressions turn out to be useful for a systematic search for Standard-like models respectively for providing a statistical ensemble in the spirit of [29].",
