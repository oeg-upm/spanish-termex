For a hardmetal (such as WC-Co) cold compaction of the powder to a green body is followed by liquid-phase sintering from the subsequent heating. This means that the binder metal Co is heated to melt in order to obtain sufficient mobility via capillary action, i.e., via surface traction, stemming from stored surface energy. The resulting flow causes gradual filling of the pore space and brings about a macroscopic shrinkage of the particle compact until a completely dense state is obtained, at least ideally.
