    "original_text": "Poor oxidation behavior is the major barrier to the increased use of Ti-based alloys in high-temperature structural applications. The demand to increase the service temperature of these alloys beyond 550°C (the typical temperature limit) requires careful study to understand the role that composition has on the oxidation behavior of Ti-based alloys [1–3]. The attempt to overcome this limitation in Ti-based alloys has led to the production of alloys with substantially improved oxidation resistance such as β-21S and also development of coatings and pre-oxidation techniques [1,4–6]. While it is tempting to extrapolate the oxidation behavior (e.g. oxidation rate law, depth of oxygen ingress and scale thickness) observed for a limited number of compositions under a certain oxidation condition to a broader compositional range, there are numerous examples in the literature where deviations from the expected relations are observed [7,8].",
