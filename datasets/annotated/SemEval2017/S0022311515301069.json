These monitor sets consist of different metal wire pieces that have an activation reaction at a specific energy range. The different activation energies are chosen in such a way that the spectrum can be reconstructed. In BODEX, each capsule contained a flux monitor set on the back side (as seen from the core) and one on the front side, positioned at the central height of the capsules. Additionally, one detector was placed at the top and one at the bottom, resulting in a total of 6 monitor sets per leg. The fluence in each capsule was determined as the average between the two flux monitor located in each capsule. The sets have been analysed by determining the activation of each wire piece, which indicates the fluence of a specific energy range.
