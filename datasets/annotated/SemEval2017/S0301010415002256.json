The vibronic coupling model is a simple polynomial expansion of diabatic potential energy surfaces and couplings. The expansion coefficients are chosen so that the eigenvalues of the potential operator map on to the adiabatic potential surfaces.

It is also the inspiration for a diabatisation scheme that is used in modern, direct-dynamic methods that include non-adiabatic effects [6].
