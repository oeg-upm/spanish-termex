Thus in this study we will consider flows with power-law index in the range 12<n⩽1. They have also shown that for 12<n<1 to ensure the correct algebraic decay in the numerical solutions one must apply the Robin condition(11)(u¯′,v¯′)=nη(n-1)(u¯,v¯)asη→∞,at some suitably large value of η=η∞≫1. In the Newtonian case this relationship becomes singular, this is due to the fact that when n=1 the functions u¯ and v¯ decay exponentially.
