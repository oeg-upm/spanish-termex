Indeed, in the Randall–Sundrum model in five dimensions [2], the following facts are well known: spin 0 field is localized on a brane with positive tension which also localizes the graviton while the spin 1/2 and 3/2 fields are localized not on a brane with positive tension but on a brane with negative tension [6]. Spin 1 field is not localized neither on a brane with positive tension nor on a brane with negative tension [7]. In six space–time dimensions, the spin 1 gauge field is also localized on the brane [8]. Thus, in order to fulfill the localization of Standard Model particles on a brane with positive tension, it seems that some additional interactions except the gravitational interaction must be also introduced in the bulk. There is a lot of papers devoted to the different localization mechanisms of the bulk fields in various brane world models.",
