EASSRs could potentially be used for objective CI fitting. However, EEG signals are contaminated with electrical CI artifacts. In this paper, we characterized the CI artifacts for monopolar mode stimulation and evaluated at which pulse rate, linear interpolation over the signal part contaminated with CI artifact is successful.MethodsCI artifacts were characterized by means of their amplitude growth functions and duration.ResultsCI artifact durations were between 0.7 and 1.7ms, at contralateral recording electrodes. At ipsilateral recording electrodes, CI artifact durations are range from 0.7 to larger than 2ms.ConclusionAt contralateral recording electrodes, the artifact was shorter than the interpulse interval across subjects for 500pps, which was not always the case for 900pps.SignificanceCI artifact-free EASSRs are crucial for reliable CI fitting and neuroscience research.
