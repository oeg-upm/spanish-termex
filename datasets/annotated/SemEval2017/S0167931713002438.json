Further calculations by Camellone et al. have shown that electrons can spontaneously trap in non-defective continuum random network model of a-SiO2 [17]. Recent calculations have also demonstrated that the two dominant neutral paramagnetic defects at surfaces of a-SiO2, the non-bridging oxygen centre and the silicon dangling bond, are deep electron traps and can form the corresponding negatively charged defects [18]. However, these theoretical predictions have not yet been confirmed experimentally, emphasising the challenges for identifying defect centres.",
