    "original_text": "Half metallic ferromagnets (HMF) have attracted enormous interest due to their applications in spintronic devices [1]. Dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) are considered to be the best materials to show half metallicity. These materials have two components, one being a semiconducting material with diamagnetic properties while the other is a magnetic dopant such as transition metal having un-paired d electrons [2]. The major advantage of these materials is utilization of electrons spin as information carrier since advanced functionalities in spintronic devices can be viable by the use of spin degree of freedom along with the charge of electrons [3]. The major issue regarding the applicability of these materials is to enhance the Curie temperature above room temperature. Thats why the research interest shifted towards large band gap materials. A lot of work has been reported on DMSs with different II–VI and III–V semiconductors as host material such as, ZnS, CdS, GaN, ZnO, ZnSe, ZnTe, TiO2, SnO2 [4–12].",
