    "original_text": "Let us now consider the case of a beta-beam source. Similarly to the case of a static tritium source, an advantage of the beta-beams is that the neutrino fluxes can be very accurately calculated. Fig. 3 shows the electron–neutrino scattering events in the range of 0.1 MeV to 1 MeV and 1 keV to 10 keV, respectively. (In Fig. 3(b) we have rounded to the nearest integer number of counts.) The shape of the flux-averaged cross sections is very similar to the reactor case as reflected in the event rates shown in the figures. As can be seen, by measuring electron recoils in the keV range with a beta-beam source one could, with a sufficiently strong source, have a very clear signature for a neutrino magnetic moment of 5×10−11μB. These figures are for Helium-6 ions, however, similar results can be obtained using neutrinos from 18Ne. The results shown are obtained for an intensity of 1015 ν/s (i.e., 1015  ions/s). If there is no magnetic moment, this intensity will produce about 170 events in the 0.1 MeV to 1 MeV range per year and 3 events in the 1 keV to 10 keV range per year. These numbers increase to 210 and 55, respectively, in the case of a magnetic moment of 5×10−11μB.",
