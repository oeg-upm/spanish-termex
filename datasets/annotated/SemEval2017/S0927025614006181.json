The inter-particle and particle wall contacts are modelled using the linear spring–dashpot–slider analogy. Contact forces are modelled in the normal and tangential directions with respect to the line connecting the particles centres. Particle elastic stiffness is set so sphere overlap is not significant and moderate contact damping is applied. Particle cohesion can also be modelled but is assumed to be negligible in the current study. The translational and rotational motion of each particle is modelled using a half step leap-frog Verlet numerical integration scheme to update particle positions and velocities. Near-neighbour lists are used to increase the computational efficiency of determining particle contacts and a zoning method is used each time the list is composed; that is the system is divided into cubic regions, each particle centre is within one zone, and potential contacting particles are within the same or next-door neighbour zones.
