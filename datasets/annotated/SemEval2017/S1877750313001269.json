In addition to the performance degradation introduced by virtualization technologies, choosing what details to abstract in a virtualized interface is itself very important. Grid and cloud computing support different interaction models. In grid computing, the user interacts with an individual resource (or sometimes a broker) in order to launch jobs into a queuing system. In cloud computing, users interact with a virtual server, in effect putting them in control of their own complete operating system. Both of these interaction models put the onus on the user to understand very specific details of the system that they are dealing with, making life difficult for the end user, typically a scientist who wants to progress his or her scientific investigations without any specific usability hurdles obstructing the pathway.",
