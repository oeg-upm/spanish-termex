    "original_text": "The exquisite manipulation and exact measurement of properties of individual nanomaterials, compared with notable progress in their preparation, have not been thoroughly addressed albeit being of prime importance for the sustained development of new devices [58–61]. To date, several instruments have been designed for such goals, namely, scanning electron microscopes (SEM), atomic force microscopes (AFM) and transmission electron microscopes (TEM) [62,63]. Compared with the first two setups, which have no direct access to the material internal structure and atomic bonding information [64–67], the state-of-the-art in situ high-resolution TEM technique allows one to not only manipulate with an individual object at the nano-scale precision but to also get deep insights into its physical, chemical, and microstructural statuses [68–71]. Combining the capabilities of a conventional high-resolution TEM and AFM or STM probes produces advanced and dedicated TEM holders, which are becoming the powerful tools in nanomaterials manipulation and properties analysis. Such holders have been commercialized, for instance, by Nanofactory Instruments AB, Goteborg, Sweden [72]. The full usefulness of these advanced in-situ TEM techniques is apparent with respect to mechanical and thermal property analysis of individual nanostructures, e.g., elasticity, plasticity and strength data while employing direct bent or tensile tests [73–75], probing electrical characteristics, e.g., field emission [27,76,77], electrical transport tracing [78–80], soldering [81,82], and doping [83], etc.",
