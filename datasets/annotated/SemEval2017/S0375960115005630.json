Section 2 considers the implications of the coupling between the spin of a classical electron and the rapidly varying electromagnetic field produced by a laser-driven plasma wave. Sufficiently short, high-intensity laser pulses can form longitudinal waves within the electron density of a plasma.

Not all plasma electrons form this wave, however; some of the electrons are caught up in the wave and accelerated by its high fields.
