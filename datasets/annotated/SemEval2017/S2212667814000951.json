Design semantics is the annotation of form and the reflection of its symbolic meaning, which means it is an explanation of the deposited human cultural spirit. Chinese art stresses Expression, Force and Qi. In China, people advocate to learn from nature, to look up to observe the sun, the moon and stars, and look down to observe the surroundings, and take Nature and Man in One as the highest state of spirit. Design semantics is expressed in space environment design through a symbiotic philosophical view that natural and artificial forms are complementary and interactive. This form of design leads humans back to a better state of living, i.e. Nature and Man in One.",
