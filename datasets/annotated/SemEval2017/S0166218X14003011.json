It is known that these sequences are eventually periodic when the digraphs are strongly connected. The transient of such periodicity depends, in general, both on the size of digraph and on the magnitude of the weights. In this paper, we show that some bounds on the indices of periodicity of (unweighted) digraphs, such as the bounds of Wielandt, Dulmage–Mendelsohn, Schwarz, Kim and Gregory–Kirkland–Pullman, apply to the weights of optimal walks when one of their ends is a critical node.",
