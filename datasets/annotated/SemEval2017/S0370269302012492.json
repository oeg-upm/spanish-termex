                "We begin by writing the equation satisfied by the s-wave with energy ω, φ(r,t)=φ(r)eiωt, of the linear fluctuations of the four overall transverse scalars about the self-dual string, (it is known that there are problems when one considers higher angular momentum modes [23], one must take care with the validity of the linearized approximation, this is discussed in [13]): (15)ρ−3ddρρ3ddρ+1+R6ω6ρ6φ(ρ)=0, where ρ=rω, R=Q1/3ℓp.",
                "Note, as pointed out by [11] <br>world volume solitons</br> have a much sharper potential than the Coulomb type potential typical of brane solutions in supergravity; thus this scattering is different to that of the string in six-dimensional supergravity.",
                "Nevertheless, for small ωR one may solve this problem by matching an approximate solution in the inner region to an approximate solution in the outer region; this follows closely the supergravity calculation [24]."
