After obtaining the FMC data, the target region, which is in the x–z plane in 2D (Fig. 1), is discretized into a grid.

Note that the z-position of all elements is zero (Fig. 3a). The summation is carried out for all possible transmitter–receiver pairs and therefore uses all the information captured with FMC.
