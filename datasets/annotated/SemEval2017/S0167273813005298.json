In the literature, curved pathways along the <100> direction passing through the 48i site are generally observed in fluorite materials [20], the prevalence of curve pathway as opposed from straight pathway is explained by the repulsion between cation and anions, the curved pathway allowing the cation–anion to maintain a reasonable distance. However, a straight pathway is observed for Y0.785Ta0.215O1.715 [23], as is the case for the present material. This suggests that Ta and Re cations might play a similar role in these systems.",
