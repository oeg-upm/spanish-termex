The method is conceptually simple, cheap to implement and does not require a dense linear boundary-layer mesh. It is based on the use of an isoparametric [17] or, in general, a transfinite interpolation [18] where a high-order coarse boundary-layer prismatic mesh is subdivided into either prisms or tetrahedra using the mapping that defines the coarse high-order prisms. The procedure is also very versatile as it permits meshes with different distributions of y+ to be generated with ease and furthermore, the validity of these meshes is guaranteed if the initial mesh is valid and the polynomial space is chosen appropriately.",
