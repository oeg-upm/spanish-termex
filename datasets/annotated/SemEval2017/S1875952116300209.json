The following database collections were examined as possible sources for the corpus: the Emotional Movie Database (EMDB) [19], and Film Stim [20]. However, these were discarded after review as unsuitable. The aim of this study is to enhance the mood in the film score, and in the case of the clips in the EMDB, no audio is provided which deemed the clips unsuitable. In the case of the Film Stim database, the clips are in French rather than English, and with no subtitles which where also deemed unsuitable since the studies are carried out with English speaking participants. Furthermore, the Film Stim selection is based on the affective content of the narrative as in most of them there is no music which is also unsuitable as discussed. From our review of available database collections, it was found that at present there is no standard corpus of affective movie clips where the affective indexing referred to the musical score of the clip.",
