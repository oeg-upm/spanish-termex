At the GP the elastic and viscous components of the complex modulus, G′ and G″, respectively scale in oscillatory frequency, ω, as G′(ω)∼G″(ω)∼ωα where α is termed the stress relaxation exponent [15].

GP measurements may involve frequency sweeps with repeated consecutive application of a set of small amplitude oscillatory shear, SAOS, waveforms [15,16], or by Fourier Transform Mechanical Spectroscopy, FTMS, in which G∗(ω) is found by simultaneous application of several harmonic frequencies in a composite waveform and its subsequent Fourier analysis [17,18]. Frequency sweeps are limited to relatively slow gelation processes due to sample mutation and interpolation errors [9,19,20].
