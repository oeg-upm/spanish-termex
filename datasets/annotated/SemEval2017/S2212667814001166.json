In this paper, we try to explore the factors behide climate changes by combining window query and time-varying data mining techniques. With constant query time and acceptable storage cost, the algorithms presented support various queries on 3d time-varying datasets, such as average, min, and max value. A new time-varying data analysis algorithm is given, which is especially suitable for analyzing big data. All these algorithms have been implemented on and integrated into a visual analysis system, with tiled-LCD ultra-resolution display. Experimental results on several datasets from practical applications are presented.",
