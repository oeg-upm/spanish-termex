The proposed model could reveal explicit correlations among different input variables of the underlying function which is unknown or expensive for computation. Taking advantage of HDMRs hierarchical structure, it could alleviate the exponential increasing difficulty, and gain satisfying accuracy with small set of samples by SVR.
